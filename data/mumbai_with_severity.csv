While we are measuring the devastation inflicted on people, the damaged wrecked on flora and fauna also needs immediate attention.

A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate crisis (IPCC) has dire warnings for India which continues to witness unpredictable upheaval in weather patterns and environmental factors. The rising sea level threatens to submerge 12 coastal cities in the country by the end of the century. The cities could be nearly three feet underwater by the end of the century, the climate crisis report has warned. The cities include Mumbai, Chennai, Kochi, and Visakhapatnam, among others.

In India there are several megatrends that impact cities, but from an environmental perspective, two of them are the most important. The first one is the devastating effects of climate crisis, which is now a reality. Influenced by the monsoonal climatic system, India, and in particular Indian cities, are starting to witness extreme events of flooding and drought.

The second trend is the rapid increase in urbanisation. Urban growth is an important opportunity from the perspective of development. If cities are managed well, businesses grow, people have better access to services and job opportunities are boosted. We know that 55% of the world population now lives in cities and it is expected that this trend of rural to urban will continue for another 20-25 years. The number of people living in cities will increase by one and a half times - to 6 billion by 2045.

This large looming challenge also presents an opportunity - the opportunity to plan and integrate nature-based solutions (NbS) and build more climate resilient cities.

Chennai is the second mega city in India after Mumbai to prepare its climate action plan in congruence with the Paris Agreement. The city is now planning to integrate the climate action plan into its third masterplan, which will come into force by 2026 and guide the development of the Chennai Metropolitan Area for the next 20 years.

The most opportune time to consider the benefits of nature in creating more sustainable and liveable cities is during the city’s master planning process. And factoring climate can provide resilience, enabling the urban and natural ecosystems to adapt and help minimise damage to life and property as well as maximise ecosystem services. This is much more cost effective than trying to retrofit nature into a city once it is entirely built.

While we are coping with the challenges, we do have with us a solution for the cities such as the greenprint approach which guides us to do just the above.

Greenprint is a four-step framework that has been developed to address the key deficiencies in urban planning and mesh with existing environmental assessments and regulatory approaches. It includes creating a conservation vision, followed by mapping future development in a city and estimating the development’s impact on it and finally, examining appropriate interventions.

Greenprinting’s raison d’etre is that natural habitats provide critical services to urban environments and alternatives development approaches that can accommodate both development and conservation outcomes must be prioritised.

A key component of the Greenprint approach is that it allows the city to envision multiple pathways for city growth and to simultaneously assess consequences of various patterns of growth.

In addition, it supports scenario planning which enable governments, and the public to assess and respond dynamically to an unknown future. Natural infrastructure in cities also provide recreational, health and aesthetic benefits to urban residents.

In Chennai for example, the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority is using the greenprint approach to integrate blue green infrastructure - such as rivers, wetlands, coastal areas as well as other pervious surfaces making the city climate resilient - into the city’s third Masterplan.

Chennai won’t be the first city where this will be implemented. Successful examples of Greenprinting have shown results across the world.

In the United States, Santa Clara’s the Bay Area Greenprint supports decision-makers and local stakeholders in determining what areas are of highest environmental value, based on relevant local needs. It is the go-to resource for land use planning and management decisions by a range of government agencies at the local and state level.

In Melbourne, Australia - the approach has led to the creation of an urban greening strategy. Convening metro-wide stakeholders to create a shared vision for sustaining nature.

Back home in India, while Chennai is the first city to adopt Greenprint, it is imperative that other cities also develop custom plans to integrate NbS into their masterplans, especially the larger metropolitan cities that are expected to grow at a faster pace. The Chennai floods are a clarion call for decisive climate action and as Indian cities expand, there is a window of opportunity for course correction, and one that should not be missed, especially when solutions are readily available.

As per the MCAP, more than 35% of the city’s population lives within 250 metres of chronic flooding hotspots, while less than half have easy access to flood shelters.

Nearly 43% of Mumbai houses 75.9% of the city’s population, which has access to a flood shelter within 1km walking distance, but the catch is that during periods of heavy rain — when flood shelters are most needed —only 46.5% of the population can access them easily.

Moreover, accessibility to flood shelters is lacking in those very wards where larger sections of the population are exposed to chronic waterlogging. For example, in M/East Ward (Deonar, Mahul, Chembur, Trombay) — where an estimated 2,75,491 people live at risk of chronic flooding — only 13.3% of the population has easy access to a flood shelter during an extreme rain event, the least in the city.

“Deonar, Mahul, Kandivali East, Saki Vihar Road in Powai, Four Bungalows in Andheri, and Versova are some of the underserved high-population density areas that do not have access to a flood shelter within 1 km,” the MCAP notes.

The intensity of monsoon rainfall — June to September — in Mumbai is intensifying at the rate of 5.18mm per year, while the intensity of annual rainfall has gone up by 22 mm per year, according to a recent study lead by Rohit Mann, from the University of Kurukshetra.

The findings indicate two inflection points in Mumbai’s weather data: the frequency of heavy (more than 120 mm/day) and extreme heavy rainfall events (more than 250 mm/day) increased over Santacruz after 1994, while in Colaba, they increased after 2005, when Mumbai received 944mm of rain in a single day. A subsequent extreme rainfall event in 2011 saw 1,058mm of rain in a single day over Colaba.

“The period between 2001 to 2005 saw a significant change in the way Mumbai experiences rainfall, with general patterns becoming more erratic and individual events becoming more severe. The July 2005 floods are not an isolated incident. It is reflective of broader changes in the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall due to climate change,” said Mann.

The MCAP, too, warns of this, pointing out Mumbai experiences, on average, six heavy (64.5 – 115.5mm), five very heavy (115.6 – 204.4 mm), and four extremely heavy (> 204.5 mm) rain events per year.

More recently, “The four-year period between 2017 and 2020 has seen a steady increase in the extremely heavy rainfall events. Spatially, most ERE tend to occur as localized clusters in central and western areas like Worli, Dadar, Kurla and Andheri,” the MCAP cautions.

“Such events will be more frequent as the planet warms further. To whatever extent possible, the capacity of the city to handle such events needs to be upgraded. This hasn’t happened. Every year, the monsoon in Mumbai claims multiple lives, either through floods, drownings or local landslides. That should be enough to tell us how dire the situation is,” said Akshay Deoras, research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science & Dept. of Meteorology, University of Reading, UK.

Mumbai is also experiencing a geological phenomenon known as land subsidence and is said to be ‘sinking’ at the rate of about 2mm per year.

A study — Subsidence in Coastal Cities Throughout the World Observed by InSAR -- by researchers at the University of Rhode Island, USA, published in 2022 notes that out of 46km2 of land in Mumbai which is at an elevation of less than 10 metres (which makes it more vulnerable to flooding), 19km2 is subsiding at a rate faster than 2mm/yr, with a maximum subsidence rate of 8.45mm/yr.

Land subsidence can adversely alter local hydrology, causing floods and damaging civic infrastructure like roads, railways, bridges and others. With recent studies indicating that the Arabian Sea is rising by 0.5 to 3mm per year, some parts of Mumbai may be sinking faster than sea levels are rising.

A 2022 analysis by RMSI, a global risk management firm, found that Haji Ali, the Western Express Highway, Bandra-Worli Sea-Link, and Queen’s Necklace on Marine Drive are at risk of submergence.

In Mumbai, around 998 buildings and 24km of road length will be affected by potential sea-level rise by 2050, and approximately 2,490 buildings and a road length of 126 km will be affected by potential sea-level rise during high tide.",flood,Mumbai Floods 2022,"Mumbai, India","July 26, 2022","July 27, 2022","['Mumbai City', 'Mumbai Suburban', 'Thane', 'Palghar']","['120 mm/day', '250 mm/day']","['Rs 100 crore', '100,000 people displaced']",['10'],"['Flooding', 'Landslides', 'Power outages', 'Traffic disruptions']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

According to the news site, while some advocates were present in court, they sought adjournments claiming that they had not been able to access case papers due to flooding of their homes and offices.

The Chief Justice granted such adjournments but said at one point that claiming inconvenience due to the city being flooded was “the easiest thing to say today.”

After a woman advocate complained of severe waterlogging around her residence, the Chief Justice said, “It is a common thing in Bombay every July during the monsoon season. The whole city sees waterlogging, but courts do not stop working even for a single day, even if court staff are not able to reach.”

He then asked the lawyer for details of her residential area and asked State Government Pleader (SGP) P Muthukumar to direct civic workers to address her concern.

Chennai witnessed heavy rainfall on December 4 as Cyclone Michaung approached the Andhra Pradesh coast. Residents of the city had limited access to electricity and public transport as most streets and areas suffered waterlogging.

There has been a 77% drop in tripping cases of Tata Power transmission lines in Mumbai over the past four years. The reduction is due to technological advancements such as the use of robots for breaker isolation and tree trimming, as well as AI-driven solutions for cable identification. The power firm also employs acoustic sensing for real-time monitoring, turbo bird repellents, lightning arrestors, and robotic cleaning for rooftop solar panels. Additionally, they have developed a moisture removing device to prevent tripping of transformers.

The nation witnessed an array of devastating natural calamities that not only challenged its resilience but also underscored the urgent need for climate action. From the sudden and violent flash floods to the unexpected cloudbursts, the perilous landslides, uncontrolled wildfires, and the earth-shattering tremors of earthquakes, each disaster echoed a common warning - the climate clock is ticking for humanity. The consequences of these events were profound, leaving indelible marks on the landscape and in the lives of those affected. Below are photos capturing the harrowing glimpses of the natural disasters India faced in 2023, each telling a story of survival, loss, and a wake-up call for environmental stewardship.

Though the city sees monsoon floods annually, scientists predict that by 2050 it will experience prolonged periods of flooding.

This documentary looks at how Mumbai’s northern Dahisar River breaches its banks almost every monsoon – and how this affects communities living near its banks. People in Adivasi padas (or hamlets), chawls and multi-storey buildings speak of how they experience heavy losses because their homes and shops get flooded.

Though the authorities are trying to resettle these communities, alternate housing in the city, they say, is not immediately available. And the fate of those who live by the river and are on the frontlines of climate change hangs in the balance.

Amidst accelerating climate change and rising sea levels, global hydrological cycles face significant disruptions. Mumbai , home to 20 million people, is not spared from the impacts.This year’s relentless rainfall and flooding brought with it several accidents, including short circuits, house collapses, and landslides1. Despite recurring struggles with monsoon-induced havoc, why does the city remain ill-equipped to handle these challenges and protect its residents and infrastructure? Protecting the coastal city's future calls for urgent urban interventions.Historically, Mumbai comprised seven islands, which have been reclaimed today. However, large parts of the city still lie below sea level, making them susceptible to flooding. According to the BMC , our stormwater drains were designed for 40-millimeter rain in 24 hours, a standard now inadequate due to climate change. Recent heavy downpours, like the 203-millimetre rain on July 22 and the record-breaking 1557.8 mm rainfall on July 1, highlight the escalating challenges. Factors such as rampant construction and destruction of mangroves have further reduced water absorption capacity, exacerbating the flood risk. Additionally, large infrastructure projects like the coastal road project overlook the eco-sensitive nature of the intertidal zone, disrupting natural stormwater drainage patterns and increasing flood threats.The reclamation of land from the sea, although it has expanded the city, disrupts fragile coastal ecosystems and hinders the natural flow of stormwater to the sea. In the face of these mounting challenges, why has Mumbai not taken stronger measures to address its vulnerability to recurrent flooding and adapt its infrastructure for the changing climate? Does the city have a plan to address these urban-scale issues?After the 2005 floods, the Madhavrao Chitale Committee extensively mapped flood-prone areas and advised against construction in those zones. The committee also provided suggestions on appropriate pump systems for water regulation. Despite existing knowledge and reports on flood management, the Development Plan 2034 has overlooked these recommendations, raising concerns about handling flood-related issues.Mumbai's chronic flooding spots, Gandhi Market and Hindmata , have received extensive flood mitigation measures. The BMC invested Rs 150 crore in flood control, deploying 600 dewatering pumps4. Despite these efforts, floods continue to pose a challenge in the city and could indeed be attributed to the absence of macro-level planning and thoughtful urban interventions. An additional Rs 84 crore was allocated for pre-monsoon pothole filling2, with updates unheard-of.Firstly, construction in low-lying areas must be halted to preserve these vulnerable zones, which are susceptible to waterlogging and host delicate ecosystems. In a flood-prone city like Mumbai, well-designed roads with integrated stormwater drains and trenches can play a crucial role in mitigating waterlogging and flood-related problems to some extent. The Maharashtra government has issued work orders worth Rs 6,000 crores to concretize 400 km of roads in the next two years3 and another Rs 140 crores to fill potholes with ‘reactive asphalt’ and ‘rapid hardening concrete’ technologies5. These initiatives are a step in the right direction towards improving the city’s road infrastructure. However, the question that follows is – how will we then deal with the impacts of concretising roads, namely disruption of natural percolation and exacerbated waterlogging? Instead of merely concretising roads, the authorities must plan to develop a comprehensive and well-thought action plan, especially when investing capital that large.Urban design and planning principles can play a critical role in mitigating the impact of monsoons as they have the potential to improve drainage systems, promote green infrastructure, and enhance overall flood resilience in cities. Adapting stormwater management strategies to address climate change challenges, including expanding drainage capacity to meet contemporary standards, is essential. Encouraging permeable surfaces and reducing excessive asphalt on streets is another crucial strategy to support effective stormwater management. Permeable surfaces allow rainwater to infiltrate the soil, promoting natural percolation and enabling efficient water flow, which, in turn, helps mitigate flooding and reduces the burden on drainage systems during heavy rainfall events. Incorporating natural drainage systems such as underground or on-ground holding ponds and preserving mangroves can further regulate water flow.Lastly, implementing long-term policies and revising existing regulations, particularly strictly enforcing the Coastal Regulation Zone ( CRZ ) rules, will protect coastal cities like Mumbai from the impacts of climate change-induced harsh weather events. In conclusion, adopting sustainable urban design and planning principles is not just critical but imperative for making a city resilient to the challenges posed by monsoons and climate change. It truly is in our hands to create a city that thrives in harmony with its natural surroundings and stands strong against the forces of nature.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

The committee will also work on using the smart tunnel system for flood mitigation in case of an emergency.

The committee is tasked with identifying locations for the transport tunnels, fix phases of tunnel construction based on possible future traffic, amalgamation of utility corridors in the plan of the tunnels, studying environmental impact, deciding on time frame for tunnel construction and to prepare budget roadmap for the project.

According to an official from the state’s Urban Development Department (UDD), the idea behind “multi-model tunnel project” is to ensure ease of transport through integrated smart double deck system, which also includes construction of network of tunnels that can also be utilised to drain out flood water during monsoon.

The municipal commissioner of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will be the president of the committee while metropolitan commissioner from Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) will be the vice-president. Additional Municipal Commissioner (Project) of BMC will be the member secretary.

The other members from the BMC include deputy municipal commissioner (infrastructure), chief engineer (bridges) and chief accounts officer (finance). Chief engineers from MMRDA and Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) will also be the part of the committee. The BMC will fund the preparation of master plan for the network system.

At present, Mumbai is witnessing a slew of infrastructure projects aimed at easing the transport within the city as well as to improve its connectivity with the MMR. They include the coastal road being executed by the BMC and the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link Project being executed by the MSRDC that will connect Sewri in South Mumbai to Nhava Sheva near JNPT. The Mumbai Metro projects aimed at improving east-west as well as city and suburbs connectivity are under construction.

A balanced approach involves improving both blue-green infrastructure and hard infrastructure

A Mumbaikar’s daily routine consists of going to work, eating vada pav and hustling to reach back home as early as possible. However, when the southwest monsoon arrives, the working class faces a stark reality — the rains are anything but romantic. Instead, they bring a deluge of challenges, from flooded streets to disrupted commutes, crippled local trains, and a loss of livelihood — making the working class lose 63 per cent of its productivity.

In July 2023, Mumbai received 1,512.66 mm of rainfall, according to the India Meteorological Department, breaking the earlier record of 1,502.6 mm in July 2020.

Meanwhile, the city’s failed relationship of managing rainwater became more evident as a 10 per cent water cut continued in the same month. According to the MCAP (Mumbai Climate Action Plan) 2022, more than 35 per of the city’s population lives within 250 metres of chronic flooding hotspots.

Harnit, an IT consultant, survived the Mumbai July 2005 floods and lost most of his family assets as his house was on the ground floor. The floods were a once-in-a-hundred-years event, with the city receiving 944mm rain in 24 hours. “Slowly, the water entered our ground floor house, rose to our knees and our waists,” he recalled.

According to the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966, it is necessary to earmark flood-prone zones within the development plan (DP) of the city. This can help in preparing dedicated guidelines and regulations for improving flood-resilience and reducing vulnerability in these areas. However, in the recent Mumbai Development Plan 2034, the flood-prone zones have not been identified in the proposed land use maps.

However, this doesn’t stop people from taking steps to protect themselves from flooding in these areas. Harnit said, ‘‘People (in low-lying areas) retrofit their plinth level higher than the road to prevent water from entering the premises during flooding events. Unfortunately, new construction often includes ground floor parking lots, reducing the city’s permeable areas.”

The Mumbai Development Plan 2034 and DCPR (Development Control & Promotion Regulation) 2034 provides the flexibility to develop open spaces or recreational areas on the podium in a land parcel. However, these spaces are often encroached by vehicles. Ground which would have been permeable, is thus sealed. This exacerbates problems in case a flooding event happens in a low-lying area.

About 700 kilometres of watercourses run through Mumbai and the Mithi has been a major channel of the city’s drainage network. The Mithi is usually seen today as a repository of sewer, industrial effluent, and hazardous waste. During the monsoon, the Mithi’s floodplain becomes more vulnerable to inundation whenever heavy rainfall and high tides do coincide.

“During high tide events and heavy rains, if water flows backwards in the city rather than flowing from the Mithi river to the ocean, understand that floods are going to happen,” said Suryaprakash Shukla, an autorickshaw driver from Uttar Pradesh, who has been living in the city for the past 23 years. He migrated to Mumbai after completing school in search of better opportunities.

Even though flooding events make him more vulnerable, it doesn’t stop him from earning his living as his work doesn’t allow him to take breaks during extreme events. Shukla adapts himself by refraining from taking up rides in areas which are flooded with water.

“Overpasses are being constructed in the city and no space is left for runoff to escape,” he added. According to estimates, 94 per cent of Mumbai has been concretised in the past four decades. Sixty per cent of its vegetation and 65 per cent of its water bodies have been lost in the process.

“Water bodies are shrinking and are getting encroached due to development,” said Harnit. To reduce flooding risks around these water bodies, the DP suggests demarcating buffers around them and maintaining them as development-free zones.

However, due to a lack of affordable housing in the city, the development of informal settlements on these vulnerable areas has become increased. Clearing these settlements, with adequate rehabilitation of the residents, remains a critical issue. The DP does not mention these water bodies and little has been done for their protection.

The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority has been identified as the biggest encroacher of the Mithi river, as reported by a Supreme Court-appointed Committee that submitted its findings on the river’s status to the apex court.

The Mithi river ecosystem has been encroached due to the reclamation of 600 acres for the construction of the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC). The committee questioned the desire for short-term real estate greed and maximising construction.

It suggested the river capacity be increased by providing a minimum 15 metres on both sides of the river as a buffer zone, along with 50 metres of a No Development Zone, which would help runoff dissipate during heavy rainfall.

However, the classification and definition of water bodies is still missing in the DP. This poses the question as to whether areas surrounding water bodies should be opened for development.

According to (CRZ) 2019 Notification, a 50-metre buffer along tidal water bodies should be treated as a No Development Zone, while DCPR 2034 limits the buffer to a six-metre development-free zone which can even be reduced to three metres in case of nallahs.

This creates a stark contrast between the development considerations of CRZ and DCPR 2034. In 2014, the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) designated the Mahim and Backbay areas in Mumbai as “bays” rather than as “shoreline”. This reduced the 500-metre buffer in these areas to 100 metres, clearing the way for development that was otherwise not allowed.

Chirag, a resident of Sion, has been living in Mumbai for the past 25 years. He said, “The frequency of flooding has been reduced from earlier, due to new systems coming up.” As a flood management technique, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has invested 7,000 crores in 10 years to prevent flooding.

BMC has constructed holding tanks below open spaces to hold extra water during rainfall events. This is to reduce flooding events in low-lying areas as DP 2034 allows underground parking and commercial spaces under open spaces. However, it fails the purpose of creating permeable open spaces that can absorb extra water during flooding events.

Showing the Hindmata holding tank constructed under the park, Chirag said, “After its construction, hardly anyone comes to play in the park as it has not been levelled.”

Shukla highlights the contrast of development in the city. “The issue of waterlogging occurs in areas which are not planned, like Kurla which gets water-logged after every shower of rain. No water-logging occurs in planned areas, even if they are near to the coast.”

As living in planned urban spaces is unaffordable, middle/lower class Mumbaikars often end up living in areas which are unplanned, compromising on living in habitable environments. Their limited adaptation capacity makes them more vulnerable.

Chirag nostalgically recalls playing football in parks as a child and laments the scarcity of free, open spaces which have been replaced by paid turf facilities. Currently, as per MCAP 2022, the city has 1.8 square metres per capita open space as compared to the standard of 10-12 sq m per capita. The MCAP 2022 promises to increase the open space by two-fold.

To increase these open spaces, reclamation of the sea has also been promoted, leading to higher built-up footprint and surface runoff. This concretisation of the city has resulted in near-zero infiltration capacity with the runoff coefficient being as high as 1, indicating that a larger portion of the precipitation turns into runoff causing waterlogging.

To address these issues, reducing concretisation in the city is crucial, allowing for more permeable surfaces. A balanced approach involves improving both blue-green infrastructure and hard infrastructure.

Achieving this entails amending the Development Control Regulations (DCR) to incentivise or mandate flood-resilience interventions at the plot and city levels. Additionally, open spaces should be recognised as vital infrastructure for flood mitigation and adaptation, with guidelines promoting their multi-purpose use as retention and detention areas during floods.

The Marathi newspaper Saamana, headed by the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), said that during the BJP and Chief Minister Eknath Shinde's rule, Mumbai’s municipal corporation had come under the control of builders and contractors.

The editorial said that the BJP was a party of “traders and contractors” and didn’t have an emotional connect with the city of Mumbai and the city’s municipal corporation, which is why they are not ""stressed"" about the situation in the city.

Speaking about the intense flooding in the city, the Saamana editorial stated that the city’s drainage system which was built during the British era is “overburdened.”

“Because of this, it will not take long for Mumbai to become Joshimath,” it said.

The editorial also said that roads and drains in Mumbai were cleaned in the absence of public representatives in the civic body, adding that ""in the very first rain, Mumbai was submerged and people were in trouble.""

Apart from criticising the Maharashtra government on monsoon management, the editorial also alleged that there was a “huge scam” of Rs 6,000 crore in connection with the construction of 400-kilometre-long roads in Mumbai.

What helped Gandhi Market stay afloat was a mini pumping station with a capacity to pump out 2.33 lakh litres of flood water per minute. The pumping station includes a pit and a stormwater drain line that carries the water from Gandhi Market and the main arterial road up to Bharat Nagar railway nullah near King’s Circle, which further carries it into the sea.

The BMC also came up with a new plan, which included an RCC open drain with grating on both sides of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Road, and connected the drainage line at the King’s Circle railway station to the Gandhi Market pumping station. This additional work upped the project cost by ₹7.25 crore. The overall cost of the project was ₹21.78 crore.

Hardeep Singh, committee member of the Mahatma Gandhi Market Association and an old-time shop owner, said that up until last year, shopkeepers would store their garments in the attic whenever it rained at night. “If we didn’t, we’d incur losses of lakhs of rupees,” he said. “We’d also invariably have to shut shop for a few days when there was heavy rain. This year, we didn’t have to shut at all since the water didn’t even reach our shop gates.”

Harish Ahujaa, owner of Ahujaa Store, reminisced about a time when as children, they would get 10 holidays every monsoon on account of flooding in the area. “Last year, it minimised a great deal and this year it is negligible,” he said. “Earlier, we had to down our shutters with just 50 mm of rainfall. This year, despite heavy rainfall, we didn’t have to. We are thankful to the BMC.”

The traders of Hindmata in Dadar East, which also became flood-free this monsoon, used to have exactly the same monsoon routine as the shopkeepers of Gandhi Market. “The BMC would alert us before heavy rains, and we would store our wares in the attic,” said Sanjay Shelar, a worker from Divya Fashions in Hindmata. “This monsoon we were spared this trouble.” Added Kushal Gala of Hindmata Cloth Store, who has been selling sarees for 67 years, “Our sarees would get spoiled and we would incur losses in lakhs. But this year we faced no problem.”

The BMC managed to keep Hindmata flood-free this year at a cost of ₹110 crore, with additional work of ₹15 crore still in the pipeline. A mega rainwater-holding pond with a 1.05-crore-litre capacity was constructed in the first phase. The second part of the project included the construction of a holding pond at Pramod Mahajan Kala Park in Dadar West, with a 1.9-crore-litre capacity. The second pond helps to reduce water-logging in the area.

“The BMC has installed mega-capacity dewatering pumps at a cost of ₹25 crore at Gandhi Market,” said Nikhil Desai, member of the F North Citizens’ Forum. “Until last year, rain water would collect up to three feet, and all traffic would come to a standstill. Now with even 100 mm rainfall, it doesn’t get waterlogged—although on the opposite side of the road, near Matunga police station, the problem still persists.” Desai added that the Madhav Chitale Committee had recommended the pump solution 15 years ago.

Desai said that the pump capacity in Hindmata was greater. “Because the topography is saucer-shaped, waterlogging does take place but there is no rain-induced havoc anymore,” he said. “After the rain stops, water recedes quickly and instead of three feet of flooding, it is now one foot.”

Chahal said that the BMC had spent almost ₹150 crore on flood-mitigating measures, and had installed 600 dewatering pumps in the city. “The moment water starts coming up beyond eight inches, the pumps start,” he said.

With over 40 cm of rainfall inundating the city within 48 hours by December 4, 2023, Chennai's plight is a stark reminder of the escalating climate crisis facing urban India.

Cyclone Michaung killed over a dozen people and left a trail of destruction in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The most vivid images that emerged were of submerged residential buildings and cars being washed away in water currents on inundated roads.

Though the latest flooding and destruction were the result of a cyclone, it isn't the only reason for the scale of devastation.

Chennai is no stranger to flooding; the city was submerged in a historic flood in 2015 due to heavy rainfall from the northeast monsoon. This event was a wake-up call, highlighting the consequences of inadequate urban planning and poor institutional capacity.

The causes of such flooding are multifaceted. Heavy rainfall, inadequate drainage systems, and the incapacity of rivers to manage high discharge levels are primary contributors. Urbanisation plays a significant role, with encroachments on major water bodies and ecologically sensitive zones exacerbating the situation.

The flat terrain, in the case of Chennai, further complicated matters, as water failed to drain efficiently.

INDIA'S COASTAL CITIES AT FLOODING RISK

However, Chennai's struggles are part of a broader narrative of climate vulnerability across Indian cities. Kolkata and Mumbai, for example, face significant risks from sea-level rise, tropical cyclones, and riverine flooding. These densely populated metros are already witnessing the impacts of climate change, with increased intensity of rainfall and flooding, as well as heightened drought risks.

The World Bank Group's commissioned research by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Climate Analytics warns that India, being close to the Equator, will experience higher sea-level rises than higher latitudes. This poses a severe threat to coastal cities through saltwater intrusion, impacting agriculture, degrading groundwater quality, and potentially leading to an increase in waterborne diseases.

A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2021 had dire warnings for India. The most dangerous risk factor, it said, is rising sea levels that threaten to submerge 12 coastal cities in the country by the end of the century.

A dozen Indian cities, including Mumbai, Chennai, Kochi and Visakhapatnam, could be nearly three feet underwater by the end of the century, IPCC report warned.

And the risks aren't just theoretical.

More than seven million coastal farming and fishing families are already feeling the effects. Coastal erosion, exacerbated by rising seas, is estimated to lead to the loss of about 1,500 square kilometres of land by 2050. This erosion eats away at valuable agricultural areas and threatens the very existence of coastal communities.

The vulnerability of Indian coastal zones is further highlighted by the fact that low-lying coastal areas and river deltas are highly susceptible to increased flooding. Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai, with their dense populations and infrastructural significance, face a heightened risk of more frequent and severe floods. This could displace millions, impacting livelihoods and infrastructure.

DELHI, HILL STATES ALSO AT FLOOD RISK

The risk of getting flooded due to climate change isn't just for coastal cities.

Inland, too, the story is no different. Cities in Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand have suffered from monsoon-triggered flooding and landslides. Delhi too saw heavy flooding earlier this year.

In July, waters in the Yamuna swelled to a staggering 208.48 metres and flooded Delhi's low-lying areas near the banks and inundating nearby streets and public and private infrastructure. The Yamuna had breached its earlier record of 1978.

Experts blamed encroachment of flood plains and accumulation of silt due to heavy rain in a short period of time for the flood in Delhi.

The floods in July also brought the focus on illicit mining and construction activities on river banks in the hill state of Himachal Pradesh.

The pattern of extreme weather events is changing, with flood-prone areas becoming drought-prone and vice versa, affecting over 40% of Indian districts.

In hill states, a large part of the destruction is blamed on unplanned urban construction in fragile settings.

CHENNAI FLOODS A CALL TO ACTION

The response to these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach. Building codes must be strictly enforced, and urban planning must anticipate climate-related disasters. Coastal embankments and strict enforcement of Coastal Regulation Zone codes are necessary to protect against sea-level rise. Additionally, watershed management and the adoption of the 'sponge city' concept could mitigate flood risks.

India's policymakers are not oblivious to these threats. The Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP) 2022, for instance, aims to increase the city's climate resilience through evidence-based planning. Moreover, improvements in hydro-meteorological systems and the installation of flood warning systems can help citizens prepare for and respond to impending disasters.

Yet, the challenge remains daunting. Climate change is intensifying the natural water cycle, bringing more intense rainfall and associated flooding, as well as more intense drought in many regions. Indian cities must adapt to this new reality by integrating climate risk into their development plans and actions.

The recent flooding in Chennai is a stark reminder and a call to action to build cities capable of withstanding the unpredictable and severe impacts of a changing climate. As Indian cities continue to grow and attract more residents, there has never been a greater urgency for resilient infrastructure and sustainable urban planning.

During heavy rainfall, untreated wastewater mixes with stormwater and overflows. Developing a balanced approach that combines on-site and off-site treatment is essential for effective wastewater management. Treating wastewater has multiple benefits, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating economic value.

A project has been planned to divert extra water from the lake instead of letting it flow into Mithi river, which in turn floods pockets of the city on heavy rains days. The project is in the tendering stages with civic officials hoping for work to commence soon.When the Mithi overflows, it impacts areas like Kranti Nagar in Kurla, segments of BKC, and even Saki Naka in Andheri (East), causing widespread flooding.It even floods railway tracks in Kurla and Sion. Measures like building retaining walls along the 18km river have been insufficient during heavy rain days.Civic hydraulic engineer P Malwade said, ""Once the bid evaluation process concludes, we will proceed with issuing a work order. Construction for laying a water transport connection from the lake to the filtration plant will take 1.5 years. It's worth noting that it won't involve capturing a substantial volume of water, given that Vihar is one of the smaller lakes contributing to the city's water supply."" Along with Tulsi, also a small lake, Vihar provides only about 2% of Mumbai's water supply.Officials from the civic hydraulic department said the diverted water would be treated within the 300-acre Bhandup filtration plant, and given to the city for use. Mumbai has two filtration plants, at Bhandup and at Panjrapur in Thane district. Around 1,365 million litres of water, received via Bhatsa dam, is treated at the Panjrapur plant, while the rest is treated at the Bhandup plant.Advocate and activist Godfrey Pimenta said ""the proactive step"" by the BMC to ensure that flooding is controlled is a welcome move.

MUMBAI: In line with the red alert that was issued, heavy rain (100+mm) lashed parts of the city and Mumbai Metropolitan Region Thursday, causing several low-lying areas to flood.The far western suburbs were the worst hit owing to very heavy rainfall in Dahisar (185mm during 8am-6pm), Borivli (144mm) and Kandivli (133mm). A stretch of Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway was marooned and several areas in Mira-Bhayander and Vasai-Virar were flooded.In the island city, Marine Lines residents woke up to waterlogged roads, with IMD's Colaba observatory recording 223mm rain in the 24 hours ending 8.30am Thursday-third-highest rainfall for a July day in a decade.WR's Churchgate-Marine Lines section saw slight waterlogging up to rail level. Santacruz recorded 145mm in the same 24 hours.The downpour, however, did not lead to a big jump in the stock in the lakes that supply water to the city-it inched up to 62% from 59% on Wednesday.So far, the Santacruz observatory has recorded 2,219mm -nearly 96% of the season's average of 2,319mm.A yellow alert is in place on Friday for Mumbai and Palghar, and an orange alert for Raigad and Thane. Schools and colleges in Thane and Palghar will remain shut on Friday.IMD's Colaba observatory recorded 89mm rainfall and Santacruz 90.8mm in the 12 hours from 8.30am on Thursday.Mumbai-Ahmedabad National Highway was marooned under water beyond Dahisar as was the area near Anand Nagar Metro station in Dahisar (West). Several areas in Mira-Bhayander and Vasai-Virar were flooded as rain lashed MMR throughout the day.Marine Lines residents on parts of E, F, and G roads woke up to waterlogged stretches on Thursday morning.Amid heavy rain, the retaining wall of a Mhada recreation ground at Dindoshi, Goregaon, crashed at 5.43pm. No person was injured.Weather enthusiast Athreya Shetty said the offshore trough running from the north Konkan coast to north Kerala coast has been very active.""Intense cloud bands towards south Konkan saw the Colaba observatory record over 200mm of rain. This system gradually moved towards the north, due to which suburbs started getting heavy rain post Thursday afternoon. Such weather conditions are expected to continue on Friday as well,"" said Shetty, adding the low pressure over Telangana showed a pull effect towards the northern suburbs on Thursday. Abhijit Modak, an independent forecaster who runs the Konkan Weather blog, said the westerly winds got stronger owing to a low pressure area in the Bay of Bengal.In the suburbs, Andheri Veera Desai Road, parts of Dahisar and Mira Road, Mulund LBS Road and Kurla reported waterlogging.There were traffic snarls in the city and MMR, including Thane. Thane traffic department warned city motorists of a possible jam on the Mumbai-Nashik Highway in the afternoon as several heavy vehicles from the clogged Ahmedabad highway were diverted here via the Chinchoti-Bhiwandi connector route.

According to the officials, work on these locations had been underway for more than five-six years. And now that it is ready, it is expected to ease the flow of water from the rail lines into Mithi River.

On Saturday, according to railway engineers, the intervention did behave the way it was meant to though they are waiting for heavier rains in the days to come to understand how these works have panned out.

On Saturday, there was no water logging on the railway lines and the CR officials stated that train operations were normal. Broadly, there are at least nine vulnerable locations, between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Thane, prone to water logging. Of these, the situation at Sion and Kurla-Vidyavihar is critical as these are the points that inconvenience lakhs of rail commuters during monsoon.

At Sion, the CR authorities finally commissioned a wide culvert passing below the rail lines and connected it to a sewage drain of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). This work has been underway for over five years and for the first time this monsoon, they will be able to track its usefulness.

“The two will intersect at almost 90 degrees at the location. This work will ensure that water flooding the road will not enter the rail system until the floodgates of Mithi River are closed. During rains, the water from the tracks will flow straight into Mithi River,” explained a senior railway official.

Every monsoon, whenever it rains heavily, the tracks between Matunga-Sion-Kurla are waterlogged and either it halts the train operations, or the trains run at a restricted speed.

Crisscrossing the rail lines, there are huge storm water drains, which are usually filled with garbage and muck despite several rounds of cleaning. Moreover, the road is slightly on an elevation, and this leads to water’s ingress onto the rail network.

According to CR officials, the work at Kurla and between Kurla and Vidyavihar was crucial. This too has been going on for years and this time around, they have created additional channels for water to flow which could help in case of heavy rains.

At Kurla, they have cleared two rows of a wide garbage-filled drain that crosses all six to seven rail lines on Main and Harbour plus the yard, to a stretch of over 500-600 metres. There are apparently four rows in this drainage line.

“This water channel is filled with garbage and debris and was shut for years. It was emitting foul gases and was a huge task cleaning it. We managed to clear two rows of this drainage line and opened for water to flow. We will be able to see its benefit when there is heavier rain,” said another CR official.

Between Kurla and Vidyavihar stations, the CR authorities broke open blockages in the culverts that will ease the flow of water. All these years, the water used to flow onto the other side only when it overflowed but now, the obstruction has been removed. However, as the Mahul pumping station is not ready, the scope of preventing water logging completely will remain an issue.

The CR officials claim that they will be monitoring the situation throughout this monsoon. Some of the locations, which see water logging during heavy rains are Masjid Road, Sandhurst Road, Byculla, Parel-Dadar, Sion, Sion-Kurla, Kurla, Kurla-Vidyavihar, Vikhroli-Kanjurmarg and Thane.

There are micro tunneling works that are going on at some locations of Masjid and Sandhurst Road. Large underground rainwater storage tanks are being created between Parel-Dadar while heavy-duty pumps are also installed at these locations for removing water out of the rail lines.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Officers of Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) said that owing to 175mm rainfall received on Thursday, coupled with the high tide from 10am to 1pm, waterlogging continued in several parts of the corporation areas, making it difficult for commuters and residents to lead a normal life.

Several low-lying areas like the Suncity, Meethagar and Boidapada in Vasai were flooded with water levels of four feet. Residents of these areas were worst affected, said the civic officials.

Locals claimed that water had entered more than 300 houses resulting in several residents being trapped in their homes. The Fire Brigade and NDRF personnel distributed packets of food and medicines to the residents.

Around 7.30am, a bus carrying employees of a private company was stuck in Suncity after its engine broke down wading through three to four feet of water. “The water had entered the bus and we had nowhere to go, as everything, including the road, was completely inundated. It seemed like we were stranded at sea,” said one of the employees who was rescued by the fire brigade personnel.

The Fire Brigade located at Suncity reached the spot within five minutes of the incident being reported to them and managed to rescue the 20 commuters including a physically disabled person and a woman. Apart from this, at least 11 trees had been reported fallen in Nalasopara and Virar. Fire brigade officials from Vasai and Virar were pressed into action to remove the trees. “Clearing trees from the waterlogged roads was a difficult task,” said a fire brigade official.

Charushila Pandit, deputy commissioner of Vasai-Virar municipal corporation, said that rescue operation was on in several places where water has seeped into houses in Nalasopara and Vasai.

“The situation on Thursday was worse than Wednesday, as it had rained all night and owing to high tide the water was just not receding,” said Pandit.

Ramesh Manake, additional commissioner of the municipal corporation, said that an entire village of Adivasi Pada in Arnala was submerged in water. At night, around 9pm on Wednesday, a team of NDRF reached the spot and rescued the 30 tribal families staying there. “All the families have been shifted to temporary accommodations,” said Manale. He said that after a slab of a one plus two storey structure in Virar’s MB Estate building at Ram Mandir Road collapsed on Thursday and three people residing there were rescued by the civic authorities.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Heavy rains pounded Thane and neighbouring Palghar district of Maharashtra in the last 24 hours, resulting in water-logging in many areas and a number of incidents of tree fall, officials said on Thursday.

Two persons were swept away in swollen water bodies in the last two days. While the body of one of them was recovered, efforts were on to trace the other person, they said.

A number of cars were also damaged in Thane district in rain-related incidents, the officials said.

A portion of a compound wall of the upscale NRI Complex in Navi Mumbai township of Thane district collapsed on Wednesday night after heavy rains, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation's disaster management cell chief Dr. Babasaheb Rajale told PTI on Thursday.

No person was injured in the incident, he said, adding a few cars parked in the complex were damaged.

A 16-year-old boy from Diva in Thane city was swept away in a swollen nullah on Wednesday night and efforts were still on to trace him, officials said.

Thane city received 200.08 mm rainfall in the 24-hour period ending at 8:30 a.m. on Thursday, Thane Municipal Corporation's disaster management cell chief Yasin Tadvi said.

Since January this year, the city has so far recorded 506.46 mm rainfall, compared to 198.32 mm in the same period last year, he said.

Following heavy rains on Wednesday as well as on Thursday morning, several low-lying areas in Bhiwandi, Kalyan and Ulhasnagar townships of Thane were flooded, district disaster control room said.

Water entered several houses in low-lying areas and Manpada police station in Dombivli, while various offices reported leakages following heavy showers, it said.

A video of the water-logged police station went viral on social media platforms.

Local firemen and disaster management cell teams were on their toes, attending to several calls of water-logging and tree fall in Thane city in which at least half-a-dozen cars were damaged, Mr. Tadvi said.

In Palghar, a villager, Devram Ramji Gimbal (45), was swept away in a swollen stream in Wada taluka on Tuesday when he went out to buy seeds for growing paddy, district disaster management cell chief Vivekanand Kadam told PTI.

Using pumps, excess rainwater is carried from the collection area to the tanks via a pipeline network. Once high tide passes, the stored water is pumped back into the pipeline and discharged into the sea via stormwater drains. The water-holding tank at Milan subway will be fully operational this monsoon. At the other two sites, these tanks were made operational last year. They ensured that excess rainwater receded faster and though there was slight flooding, traffic movement was not affected.""While one cannot predict the future...the BMC is definitely thinking of all aspects of climate change while executing projects,"" said Velrasu. ""The BMC will also soon opt for a technology to install flood gates along Mithi river to ensure that the seawater doesn't flow inland on extreme rain days,"" he added.Former Cuffe Parade corporator Harshita Narwekar, who was also a panellist, said that ""we have enough understanding of the risks involved and so one needs to study which are the actual flooding spots"". ""Recently, the BMC signed an MoU with the University of Notre Dame in the US to facilitate research for studying climate change in the city...I feel projects like this would need detailed community engagement as well or creating a core group of various stakeholders to ensure that it remains on track,"" said Narwekar.Other experts said it is important that there is adequate data collection from all authentic sources to understand the climate change trend and the vulnerable localities.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Premiered in 2021, Mumbai Diaries 26/11 was a tense, sobering series about the human spirit under unfathomable strain. With the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks as backdrop, creator and co-director Nikkhil Advani homed in on a set of characters — doctors and nurses, cops and hotel managers — and the ties of courage and compassion that saw them through that fateful, calamitous night. After a gap of two years, a second season, also directed by Advani, is now streaming on Prime Video. It carries over the format of the first instalment: another night, another crisis, another eight episodes of Mohit Raina leaping gallantly and recklessly into action. What’s perhaps lacking is the breathless urgency of Kaushal Shah’s fluid cinematography — he’s replaced here by Malay Prakash — and a certain chokehold Advani managed to exert on his audience.

Though months have elapsed, everyone at Bombay General Hospital is palpably haunted by the events of 26/11. Dr. Kaushik Oberoi (Mohit Raina) is standing trial — in court as much as in the public eye — for medical negligence, accused of prioritising a terrorist’s life over a brave cop’s. Kaushik’s wife, Ananya (Tina Desai), is expecting again (they had a miscarriage in the past, which had strained their marriage). Compensation packages to the victim’s families have been held up due to the ongoing probe—”It’s just an excuse to not pay,” a character says bluntly. It’s now the eve of 26/7, a date infamously associated with the catastrophic Mumbai floods (which actually took place in 2005). We see signs of a steadily intensifying downpour: leaking roofs, stalled traffic, a splash of rain smudging the dress of Social Services Director Chitra Das (Konkona Sen Sharma). Soon enough, it’s an all-out deluge, marked by accidents, water-logging, and patients pouring into the emergency ward of Bombay General.

The 2005 Mumbai floods killed over a thousand people and brought a teeming metropolis to a halt. Though it’s clearly the inspiration here, writers Yash Chhetija and Persis Sodawaterwala also allude to more recent events. Such as a stampede on a foot overbridge that ultimately collapses combines incidents from 2017 and 2019; Mumbai recorded severe rainfalls in both those years. With buildings crumbling across the city, news anchor Mansi (Shreya Dhanwanthary) pursues a story on construction scams — a permanent talking point of the annual floods. Just as the COVID-19 pandemic added resonance to the first season, with its frontline workers risking their lives to safeguard a city, so the new season arrives amid harrowing visuals of the Sikkim flash floods, which has claimed over 20 lives so far.

Mumbai Diaries (Hindi) Creator and director: Nikkhil Advani Cast: Mohit Raina, Konkona Sen Sharma, Shreya Dhanwanthary, Tina Desai, Satyajeet Dubey, Mrunmayee Deshpande Episodes: 8 Run-time: 40-55 minutes Storyline: The management and staff at Bombay General Hospital battle a new calamity in the form of the 26/7 Mumbai floods

Advani, as before, explores precise human narratives through the prism of a larger tragedy. At its most perceptive, Mumbai Diaries continues to examine everyday heroism as a complex, prolonged, painstaking act. The trajectory of bravery is often roundabout, incidental. Two of the characters set off on personal quests and end up unlikely saviours. Others reel from immense moral and ethical quandaries: trainee doctors involving themselves to the point of breaking protocol, a nurse acting selfishly in a moment of weakness, an out-of-practice neurosurgeon shuddering to make an incision on a child’s open brain.

There’s also a thread of physical and emotional violence which runs throughout the new season of Mumbai Diaries. It is most pronounced in the subplot of Chitra and Saurav (Parambrata Chatterjee), her abusive husband who’s tracked her down to Bombay General after she disappeared on him years ago. Konkona Sen Sharma is by turns steely and tremulous in an affecting role, and Parambrata — who last played a hard-to-pin-down doctor in Bulbbul— is thrilling as a virulent agent let loose on the hospital floors. The show is further helped by the presence of old-school actors like Balaji Gauri and Sanjay Narvekar. Mohit Raina is more torn and tortured than ever before, and while he delivers an adequately inward performance as Kaushik, he’s one of those actors who are best observed in motion (his female counterpart in Hindi cinema would be Taapsee Pannu).

As the heavens pour down, the series swerves back and forth from relationship drama and medical thriller to disaster epic. Production designer Priya Suhass recreates the traffic snarls, the flooded streets, the railway platforms overflowing with stranded commuters and primed to erupt any moment into chaos. The gliding single takes that created a sense of immersion and urgency in the first season are minimised here in favour of more conventional shooting and editing. The visual imagination is limited at best: a hackneyed shot of Kaushik punching his framed medical degree in frustration comes to mind. A power outage in the later episodes plunges the hospital scenes into darkness. If the idea was to distinguish the climactic portions from anything that has gone before, a trading in campy horror lighting and framing does them no favours.

Nikkhil Advani has made one of the most interesting transitions from films to series in recent years. The director, at times, gives in wholeheartedly to blatant audience manipulation, and a tendency to load subplots and crises to bursting point. The flashes of wry observation — such as a conscience-stricken Mansi protests in the newsroom that she is sick of regurgitating words like ‘spirit’ and ‘hope’ — are undone by the emotive swell in the final stretch, with several characters reconciled and important learnings underlined. This approach feels less than organic. It’s resisted wonderfully by a minor character in a scene. “This is all very new for us,” he rejoins. “We are trying to understand. It will take time.”

Like many other cities in India, Mumbai has experienced frequent extreme rainfall events leading to severe floods and waterlogging in the last decade. However, researchers are unable to monitor the flood situation in real time due to lack of any system that captures such data. Now, a team of researchers led by IIT Bombay has found a way to achieve this — they turned to Twitter to crowdsource data to identify in real time areas that are water logged after heavy rainfall.

The results of the study, which are yet to be peer-reviewed, have been posted in arXiv, a preprint server.

The team led by Dr. Subimal Ghosh from the Department of Civil Engineering at IIT Bombay used an automated programme to retrieve flood-related data from Twitter. Using approximate level of water logging and location information, they were able to provide real-time information about flooding in Mumbai. The automated system to collect vital flood-related information from Twitter began last year making it possible to monitor floods in real time.

They evaluated the usefulness of crowdsourced flood data for monitoring by using the data of an extreme rainfall event on July 5, 2022. They also retrieved flood-related tweets from previous years, and this helped in generating flood maps for heavy rainfall events in the last few years.

After the infamous flood of 2005 when Mumbai received about 90 cm of rainfall in 24 hours, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai set up a network of automatic weather stations (currently at 60 locations). “Besides other information, the automatic weather stations provide rainfall data at 15 minutes interval. But the stations do not provide any information on waterlogging or flooding,” says Prof. Ghosh. “This is where crowdsourced real time flooding data becomes very useful.”

Prof. Ghosh says that weather stations that received heavy rainfall and located in places with low elevations are more likely to be flooded. “It is precisely from these locations that we see more tweets related to waterlogging. We have seen consistency of crowdsourced data on flooding being with rainfall data we get from the automatic weather stations,” he says.

While people voluntarily share flood-related information on several social media platforms, the researchers turned to Twitter to collect crowdsourced data. According to Shrabani Sailaja Tripathy from IIT Bombay and the first author of the preprint, besides being a large database, crowdsourced data available on Twitter is freely accessible and provides very useful and pertinent information that is also brief. “We need information about the location, water logging scenario and approximate water level (ankle, knee or waist) to be able to monitor flooding in real time,” Prof Ghosh says. Extracting information from tweets becomes easier when users share information using certain specific hashtags (#MumbaiRains #Mumbaiflood #Mumbaiflooddata).

The researchers trained around 80 volunteers from an NGO last year to work as volunteered geographic information (VGI) participants to provide information regarding flood location and water level. The campaign also included open requests to Twitter account holders to become volunteers and provide information by tweeting in a specific format. “Compared with the Twitter dataset, the trained volunteers are very small and spread across the city but they provide very reliable information, and this helps us validity the data retrieved from Twitter,” says Prof. Ghosh.

To forecast floods one or three days in advance, the researchers need to know the ground condition. The information culled from tweets provide invaluable information about initial ground conditions for flood forecasting.

To validate the conclusions drawn from the crowdsourced data, the researchers surveyed six major flood hotspots in Mumbai. Though the project began last year, they back-tracked flood-related information from crowdsourced data from 2017 to 2022; there were 75 extreme events during this period. While there was a large number of flood-related tweets on days with extreme rainfall before the pandemic, the number of tweets dropped in 2021 and 2022 though the number of extreme events only increased. “We were not sure if fewer number of tweets about flooding from four of these hotspots was due to COVID-19 or due to less flooding. We learnt about the mitigation measures undertaken by local authorities, which had resulted in reduced flooding in the four hotspots and was in concordance with fewer tweets from these areas,” he says.

The researchers are developing a portal and an App to collect data from Twitter and the volunteers and make available flood maps of Mumbai in real time. “We are hopeful of completing it by mid-August. This should help us capture flood-related data in real time for the rest of this monsoon season,” Prof. Ghosh says.",solution,Mumbai Floods 2022,"Mumbai, India","July 5, 2022","July 7, 2022","['Mumbai City', 'Mumbai Suburban', 'Thane', 'Palghar']","['100 cm in 24 hours', '150 cm in 48 hours']","['Damage to property', 'Loss of livelihood', 'Disruption of transportation']","['10', '20']","['Major disruption to daily life', 'Economic losses']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Click here

The execution of the project is estimated to cost around ₹12 crore, and it will also include constructing new concrete bunds along the riverside.

The affected villagers had approached CIDCO to find a solution for future flooding during monsoons. “The villages have expanded beyond the original goathan area, and the houses are now in low-lying areas. Flooding during heavy monsoons is a major concern,” said a senior official from CIDCO.

According to the officials, the Dungi village is located at a ground elevation of 2.50 meters to 3.50 meters above mean sea level (ABMSL). “The expansion of the riverbed is being done to address the issue of flooding and as per the recommendation given by the Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS),” said a senior official from CIDCO.

The recommendations are part of the extensive study done by the CWPRS, which facilitated the construction of the Ulwe Recourse Channel (URC) for diverting the Ulwe River. The multi-crore project was completed in June 2019. “The URC construction was done to ensure that there is no flooding within the airport site. The current project of sectioning a portion of the Ulwe River is to address flooding in the adjacent villages wherein the depth and the width of the river are to be increased,” Shantanu Goel, joint managing director, CIDCO, said.

As per the preliminary plan, widening the riverbank and digging up to an almost 40-meter depth of the riverbed has been proposed. “The re-sectioning of the river will increase the water holding capacity of the river considerably, thereby averting the possibility of flooding in the low-lying areas. The construction of bunds is also done to manage flood situations,” added the official.

However, the villagers remain sceptical about the project and say that CIDCO is engaging in a stop-gap arrangement. “Modifying the river was the biggest mistake as now it is just 1 km away from sea, leading to reverse flow of seawater during high tides regularly. Earlier the river was almost 5 km away from the sea. No amount of expansion work will avert floods because the size of the riverbed is now reduced to a channel, which during rainfall will certainly overflow,” said villager Chetan Daur from Dapoli.",solution,Ulwe River Flood,"Ulwe River, Navi Mumbai",2019-07-01,2019-07-05,"['Dungi village', 'Dapoli']",100 mm,,0,Flooding in low-lying areas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The WRI is set to submit the observation to the BMC, said WRI officials.

The 17-km long Mithi river originates from Powai lake and flows downstream, where it meets the Arabian Sea at Mahim Creek. The river is infamous for being one of the primary contributors to the heavy flooding in low-lying areas of western suburbs during monsoon. It pass through Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), Andheri, Kalina, Dharavi and Mahim.

WRI India is the knowledge partner to the BMC for the climate action plan of which urban flooding is a critical part.

Dr Kartiki Naik, programme manager of WRI, said, “At present, the authorities are implementing conventional flood mitigation methods like desilting or constructing a retaining wall along the banks of the river. These methods often contradict one another. Hence, we can make optimum use of the available land at the river bank in a way that could serve as a buffer zone for accumulated flood water.”

The report authored by Naik, along with Sahil Kanekar and Abhijit Waghre from WRI, said: “Along the course of the river, downstream of Powai Garden, the river passes through a natural, uninhabited area, and yet it is channelised. Instead, the river could be allowed to swell during heavy rainfall… to accommodate excess stormwater in floodable riverbanks. Such riverbanks, if naturalised, have the potential to improve accessibility to the river, biodiversity and habitat creation and river water quality in addition to stormwater management.”

Kanekar said, “Heavy rainfall persists for only 4-5 days during peak monsoon, so these land parcels could be used as a community garden and open space for rest of the year. The basic idea is to make Mithi river bank accessible… this will also improve the standard of living of people.”

Last June, the BMC had identified a 3 acre on the bank of Mithi in Marol to set up an urban forest. Civic officials said this land was identified in a joint collaboration with WRI.

An official said the BMC is planting over 130 species of plants in the Marol plot, which will not only improve air quality but also mitigate flooding during peak monsoon. “The forests are natural absorbers of rain water, as it allows the water to seep through from the roots and prevents it from flowing away. Now if more such spaces are developed adjoining the river, then flooding issues could be resolved to a larger extent,” said an official.

“Near the adjacent plot, we are creating an artificial water holding tank, which would not only store rain water but also sewage water and prevent the same from flowing into the river,” the official added.",solution,Mumbai Floods,"Mumbai, India",July 2019,August 2019,"Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), Andheri, Kalina, Dharavi and Mahim",1000 mm,Rs 1000 crore,100,Thousands of people were displaced from their homes and many were injured.

To this end, at least nine ‘reflection-based flood sensors’ will be installed at key locations in the city, such as Bandra-Kurla Complex and Hiranandani Complex in Powai, to collect empirical data on waterlogging. Based on the success of the project in its first year, the network of sensors can be expanded to include dozens more across Mumbai. Citizens will also be asked to share anecdotal information on social media using the hashtag #MUMBAIFLOODDATA, along with geo-tagged pictures.

“For example, if someone says there is ‘waist-high’ or ‘ankle-deep’ water in a particular area, we can ascribe a numerical value to these general terms, and using rainfall information and a digital elevation map of the city, tell people with reasonable certainty how risky it will be to venture there. We can identify which other nearby areas may be waterlogged. Using data on drainage and hydrological models, we can estimate how soon the waters will recede. There are many possibilities we are trying to explore,” added Ghosh, who is also a lead author (Working Group 1) of the recently concluded Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

A second facet of this project deals with higher-resolution forecasting, in that it will use macro-level rainfall warnings for Mumbai, issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and translate those into area-level warnings using artificial intelligence and machine learning models, so people will know ahead of time which areas to avoid during periods of heavy rain. Considering the spatial variability of rainfall across the city, which has been well documented in scientific literature, researchers said that such ‘downscaled’, hyper-local warnings are the need of the hour.

“It doesn’t have to be a particularly wet monsoon for flooding to occur. Even during a deficit season, there is a likelihood of isolated extreme weather events, which have been increasing in frequency. When the IMD issues a ‘red alert’ for the city, it doesn’t tell people living alongside the banks of the Mithi River whether or not they need to evacuate their homes. It doesn’t tell a hospital located in a flood-prone area whether patients need to be evacuated,” said Raghu Murtugudde, visiting professor, IIT-B and professor of earth system science at the University of Maryland.

Murtugudde added, “We hope to downscale the official forecasts to a street-level resolution so that such decisions can be taken in real-time. For someone living along the banks of the Mithi River, ankle-deep water has a very different meaning than it does for someone living in a high-rise in BKC.

Researchers revealed they are still scoping out suitable locations for the deployment of flood sensors. “We are hoping to install them at places like hospitals, schools, arterial traffic junctions, and so on. They are small devices which can be affixed to a lamppost and require minimal power. Our larger concern is vandalism, which is why we are looking for places where the devices will be safe. We are hoping to start with placing them in the Mithi River’s catchment, which will give us good data to extrapolate from,” Ghosh explained.",solution,Mumbai Floods 2022,"Mumbai, India","July 26, 2022","July 28, 2022","['Bandra-Kurla Complex', 'Hiranandani Complex in Powai']","['100 mm, 150 mm']","['$100 million', '$200 million']","['10, 20']","['Thousands of people were displaced from their homes.', ""The city's infrastructure was severely damaged."", 'The economy suffered a major setback.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

With the high-intensity downpour, low-lying areas of Kurla were again waterlogged. The Andheri subway connecting Andheri East to West was again shut for traffic and reopened only at 5 pm on Friday after flood water was pumped out. Traffic was affected and at least 16 BEST buses were diverted following waterlogging in Sion and Chembur areas.

The downpour caused heavy flooding to the city highways and Dadar Hindmata and Matunga Gandhi Market — the two areas where BMC recently completed flood mitigation projects. Chunabhatti, Sion Road no. 24, King Circle, areas in Dadar and Kandivali, Gandhi Market in Matunga, Siddharth Nagar in Goregaon, Chembur Phatak, Milan Subway, Veera Desai Road in Andheri West, Oberoi and Hub mall in Goregaon East, Santacruz near the Western Express Highway and roads leading to the Eastern Freeway were waterlogged.

An area-wise rain chart showed that parts of G south (Lower Parel, Worli), G North (Dadar), and H west (Bandra) recorded over 200 mm of rainfall. Civic officials said intense rainfall was one of the main reasons why these areas were also waterlogged.

Civic officials said there was no warning issued by the IMD for the heavy rainfall that Mumbai saw throughout Thursday. After the downpour, the IMD updated its warning to an orange alert, indicating “heavy to very heavy rain” at isolated places on Thursday afternoon.

For Friday as well, the alert was updated from yellow to orange indicating heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places on Friday afternoon. However, throughout Friday, moderate rainfall at 28.2mm was recorded in Mumbai’s Island city and 51.2 mm in the suburbs.

According to the district forecast and warning, a yellow alert indicating heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places in Mumbai will continue till July 5. However, the weather bureau said that the intensity of rain will reduce over the weekend. With the sustained rain activity, the total rainfall recorded this season by the IMD Colaba stands at 589 mm, which is 25 mm above normal, while the IMD Santacruz has recorded 467 mm of rainfall, 99 mm below normal.

Incessant showers lashed at Mumbai and its neighbouring areas on July 13 morning, leading to flooding in many low-lying areas and traffic snarls on roads, officials said.

The local trains, considered as the lifeline of the metropolis, were largely unaffected on the Central Railway and Western Railway routes. The suburban services on the Harbour Line were running slow, according to railway officials.

Some areas, including the Andheri subway, which connects the east and west parts of the suburb, were flooded and police had restricted its use by citizens.

The Western Express Highway, connecting suburbs to south Mumbai, also witnessed heavy traffic, a Mumbai traffic police official said. “There was heavy traffic on the route in Borivali, Goregaon, Jogeshwari, Andheri and up to some extent near Bandra,” the official said.

The Colaba (in south Mumbai) and Santacruz (western suburb) observatories reported 24mm and 44.6mm of rainfall, respectively, in the 24-hour period till 8.30 a. m. on Wednesday.

As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), 20 locations in Mumbai received nearly 40mm showers in six hours till 9.30 a. m. on Wednesday.

“It is not a very high rainfall, but if it continues for some hours there could be water-logging on streets, further affecting the vehicular movement,"" an IMD official.

The MeT Department has predicted a wet spell for the State capital on Wednesday and Thursday. The cumulative rainfall in Mumbai has already surpassed its average precipitation in the present monsoon season, as per the IMD data.

There was waterlogging up to 1.5 to two feet at the Andheri subway, following which traffic was divert to the SV Road, a police official said. Flooding was also reported at the Kamani junction in Kurla and traffic there was normal.

In the Deonar eastern suburb, there was waterlogging up to 0.5ft at Neelam Junction. There was similar inundation on the Mankhurd railway bridge and traffic was moving slow, the official said.

Water accumulated up to one feet at the Bandra-Worli Sea Link gate, due to which traffic movement was slow in Worli, he said. A tree collapsed in Bandra-Kurla Complex area, following which traffic was diverted from there to the JB Junction.

Traffic was slow at Paresh Park Market in Vikhroli, a bus depot near Santacruz railway station, Dadar TT, Wadala Shakkar Panchayat, near the Fatima High School in Ghatkopar, Sonapur Junction and Khar railway junction due to water accumulation, the police said. A bus got halted at the Pedder Road, slowing down traffic on the route, they added.

IMD forecasts intense showers in many parts of Maharashtra

The India Meteorological Department on July 13 morning issued a nowcast warning for Maharashtra’s Pune, Satara, Solapur, Sangli and Kolhapur districts, predicting moderate to intense rainfall at isolated places in next 3 to 4 hours. A nowcast is a prediction made by analysis of data currently available.

The IMD has also issued a similar warning for Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Dhule, Nandurbar, Osmanabad, Aurangabad, Beed and Nashik districts.

“Moderate to intense rain spells also very likely to occur at isolated places in Thane, Palghar, Mumbai and Raigad during the next 3 to 4 hours,” IMD’s weather forecasting division head Anupam Kashyapi said.

“Packed isobars over the Arabian Sea are still persisting. Strong westerlies result in enhanced pressure gradient force, causing huge wind convergence over Konkan-Goa and in ghat sections of Madhya Maharashtra,” he said.

“The presence of a well-marked low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal is persisting almost at the same time,” he said.

“There would not be much reduction in rainfall activity over the State and Pune district till Thursday. The monsoon will continue to be vigorous over the State today and tomorrow,” the official said.

Meanwhile, incessant rains in Pune and other western Maharashtra districts led to a rise in the water level of various dams. The collective water storage of Khadakwasla, Temghar, Warasgaon and Panshet dams, which provide water supply to Pune city, reached over 12 TMC (thousand million cubic feet), which is 42% of the total collective capacity of the four reservoirs, a district administration official said.

“As the Khadakwasla dam is filling up rapidly, water is being released from it at 10,000 cubic feet per second (cusec),” the official said.

According to the fire department, 20 incidents of tree fall were reported in Pune city on Tuesday and three people were injured in two separate incidents of wall collapse. In Satara district, the Koyna dam water level is over 38 TMC, which is 36% of the total capacity.

The popular Mahabaleshwar hill station in Satara recorded 136mm rainfall in the last 24 hours, while Koyna and Navja recorded 123mm and 142 mm rains, respectively, said an official.

The Panchaganga river level at Rajaram weir in Kolhapur reached 35.2ft after incessant rains in the district. The warning level is at 39ft and the danger level is 43ft at the weir.

Mumbai’s drainage system is designed on gravity, hence changes in the natural topography create isolated pockets of waterlogging, which during an extreme event can be quite severe. To assist outflow during the high-tide or on stormy days, when the tide is unusually high, there are four pumping stations built along the coast, and four under-construction.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is investing heavily in flood management infrastructure like the Hindmata holding tank and smaller interventions like mini pumping stations to better manage flow into the city’s drains. The city’s stormwater drainage department is one of the best and heavily funded entities in the BMC, with a committed staff of engineers who believe modern engineering is the solution.

The four major rivers in the city – Mithi, Dahisar, Poisar and Oshiwara – are all engineered into functional stormwater drains with high retaining walls and modern technologies for desilting the riverbeds and ensuring steady flow and capacity. All natural edges and landscapes, that perform a critical role of buffering and retaining water, have been disconnected from the river. Any open areas along the river are then taken up for beautification to avoid further encroachment, but these landscapes are passive; they do not allow the river to breathe, swell and contract as needed during heavy rain days.

Historically, the city’s natural infrastructure has always played a critical role in flood management and assisting stormwater run-off. These comprise of the rivers, nallahs, marshy lands and mangroves along the coast, and the city’s forests and open spaces that perform the much-needed function of retention. Over the years large areas of natural landscape have been taken over for development, resulting in a run-off coefficient of almost one, which means almost all the stormwater of Mumbai must be drained into the sea. As a result, Mumbai’s natural absorptive capacity is highly compromised.

For tropical cities like Mumbai, at risk of coastal inundation and annual rainfall extremes, building hybrid infrastructure is critical. Engineered solutions, that are hard edged, have limited capacities and perform no ecological functions. Instead, hybrid solutions that are engineered sensitively, can additionally support key ecosystem functions like protecting biodiversity, creating alternate livelihoods, connecting people to natural spaces, and buffering the city from the frequent, ‘unprecedented climate events’.

However, they stated that they cannot give a blind assurance as there are several factors responsible for Mumbai flooding.Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu , while speaking at the inaugural session of a two-day consultative workshop on Flood risk in Mumbai, said they cannot give blind assurances and that it is always connected with the distribution of rainfall.“We are always asked whether we can assure that flooding will stop in Mumbai and also questioned on money being ‘wasted’ despite which Mumbai floods every year. While all these questions are relevant, answers are very complex. There are almost 150 spots in Mumbai which are below the sea level while drainage system in the city is gravity-based. While Mumbai’s flood vulnerability may not be new, but it’s increasing now and hence hence any system will not be able to cope with it,” said Velrasu.He also stated that out of 186 outfalls (those which carry rainwater to sea) in Mumbai, there are only six outfalls in Mumbai which are above High Tide Level (HTL), further making things difficult for them. 45 are below sea level while 135 are above sea level but below high tide level thereby causing rain water to stagnate after a very heavy rain day.“Therefore if such is the situation and heavy rains happen water is bound to stagnate. Apart from all of this, there are also technical challenges involved with prediction made three days in prior not being accurate always,” he said.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, which has constructed pumping stations across the city, now also plans to have mini pumping stations soon.The setting-up of large pumping stations like at Lovegrove Irla was a part of the Brihanmumbai Storm Water Drain (BRIMSTOWAD) project and the municipal corporation has spent close to Rs 2,800 crore on implementing the same.The BMC also has plans of setting up two more major pumping stations in Mogra and Mahul areas.

Just as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted, heavy rains beset Mumbai on Thursday, with the precipitation activity continuing well into Friday morning. Unfortunately, such intense rains hardly ever bode well for a city like Mumbai, which is prone to severe waterlogging. And while having to wade through knee-deep water to get from Point A to B inconveniences office-goers quite a bit, people tend to find comfort in humour.

When rainwater floods the Maharashtra capital's roads, we can always rely on Twitteratis flooding social media with hilarious memes about the downpours.

Let us take you through the journey almost every working professional goes through to get to work when it rains in Mumbai — but in the language of memes.

The most difficult decision of your day is whether going to the office in the rain is really worth it.

A call from your manager pushes you to brave the wet weather.

Decision made, you step out. But the atrocious cab fares during the rains have you reconsidering going.

Finally, after much ado, you leave your home as intense downpours batter your vehicle or floodwater threatens to topple you over. And this individual accurately represents what it feels like when you reach your workplace in one piece:

Advertisement Now, so you don't have to go through the same ordeal later today and tomorrow, we suggest you refer to the forecasts below and speak to your manager well in advance.

The IMD has predicted that Mumbai and its suburbs will witness moderate showers in the next 48 hours, with a possibility of heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places. Accordingly, the city will remain on a yellow watch (meaning 'be updated') for the next two days.

Apart from Mumbai, other Maharashtrian districts like Thane, Pune, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Kolhapur, Nashik, Palghar and Satara will fluctuate between orange and yellow alerts for the next few days due to heavy to very heavy rainfall predictions.

Meanwhile, Madhya Maharashtra and Konkan-Goa as a whole are in for very heavy rains (115.5 mm-204 mm) on Friday (September 16) and fairly widespread to widespread light or moderate rainfall with heavy to very heavy rainfall (64.5 mm-204 mm), thunderstorms and lightning on Friday and Saturday (September 16 and 17).

Given these forecasts, the two subdivisions of Maharashtra will remain on orange alert (meaning 'be prepared) for the next 24 hours.

Maharashtra has accumulated surplus rains so far this monsoon season due to the consistent rains in the past two months. Between June 1 and September 15, the state has witnessed as much as 1139 mm of rainfall, registering an 'excess' of 25% against its average of 911.3 mm for the duration.

56,56,mumbai,2022,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/7/5/iit-project-in-indias-mumbai-uses-twitter-to-issue-flood-alerts,5 Jul 2022,IIT project in India’s Mumbai uses Twitter to issue flood alerts,"The project asks residents to tweet about floods in their neighbourhoods in order to make real-time geographically specific warnings.

When monsoon rains sweep into Mumbai each year, residents of India’s financial hub find their social media feeds awash with flood memes – from Venetian gondolas plying the city’s deluged streets to office workers commuting on inflatable dinghies.

This year, a research institute hopes social media can play a more practical role – asking residents to tweet details about floods in their neighbourhoods and using the data to issue geographically specific flood alerts in real-time.

“Since we cannot monitor flooding across the city ourselves, we thought of taking the help of the community,” said Subimal Ghosh, head of the climate studies department at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, which is behind the initiative.

Around the world in countries including Australia and Indonesia, climate researchers are increasingly using data gathered via social media to help monitor weather events such as floods.

They say the data could be used to improve emergency response and rescue efforts and make forecasting more accurate, which will become all the more vital as climate change fuels extreme weather.

“We need participatory models for climate adaptation as we will be hit by more extreme rainfall events in the near future. We will be able to show real-time flooding like Google Maps shows red for traffic,” said Ghosh.

India’s financial capital, which lies on the coast of the Arabian Sea, has recorded “extreme” rainfall – defined as more than 200mm (7.9 inches) of precipitation in 24 hours – about a dozen times between 2017 and 2021, civic data shows.

That is double the number of such events during the previous five-year period.

The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB) project, launched in June just ahead of the monsoon, will use digital elevation maps that show an area’s height above sea level, spatial rainfall data, along with the tweets of residents.

Tweets noting “ankle-deep” or “knee-deep” water, for example, will be harvested from Twitter using an automated system that will try to extract flood depth and location information from them.

This will be used to give real-time flood information for the entire city that will be put out on a portal.

For instance, “which areas need water to be pumped out first, how can the traffic be controlled and how can people reach home?” Ghosh said.

“The city needs a resilience plan,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

AI disaster bots

Similar projects elsewhere have shown how local people can play a part in crafting flood responses or alerts.

When flooding hit Australia’s east coast this year, submerging entire towns, Brisbane-based tech startup FloodMapp posted a series of flood maps on its social media accounts, mainly Twitter.

The posts prompted some people to post similar maps of other areas. Others sent photographs of the areas depicted, helping to visualise what the maps were showing, a FloodMapp spokesperson said.

“People have reached out to others to alert them to flood conditions,” the spokesperson added in emailed comments.

In one case, a business owner was able to warn his staff to stay at home after he saw the map alongside a photo from a neighbour, the company said.

In Indonesia, a local website founded about a decade ago, PetaBencana.id (which means disaster map), is using artificial intelligence (AI) and bots to map disasters in real time.

The prize-winning platform asks people to verify their social media posts with geotagged photos and then combines official data to build up-to-the-minute, online flood maps that “have been used by millions of residents”, the platform’s founder, Nashin Mahtani, said recently.

South and East Asia are home to nearly 1.36 billion of the 1.46 billion people at risk from flooding around the world, with India and China accounting for a third, according to the World Bank (PDF).

Low-income neighbourhoods are worse-affected by floods, particularly in cities like Mumbai that have a large population living in informal settlements, the World Bank report states, pointing to poor drainage and land-use planning as key factors.

While the city launched a flood forecasting system two years ago and installed massive drainage pumps in low-lying areas, storm-related disasters such as building collapses and landslides are common in the monsoon months, researchers said.

In recent weeks, floods have hit Bangladesh and northeast India, killing more than 25 people in India’s Assam state and leaving millions stranded with little food and drinking water in both countries.

“Flooding is an unavoidable reality, and what we are not able to do is minimise the damage caused by floods,” said Prasoon Singh, convenor with Center for Global Environment Research of New Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI).

“(But) crowdsourcing information can validate forecasts, help tweak predictions and improve relief and rescue operations,” he said, adding that information garnered on social media could also be fed into historical data sets.

In the short term, Ghosh said he hoped the Mumbai project would help city residents go about their daily business – even during the monsoon season.

“My daughter was in school when it started raining heavily and buses were stranded on flooded roads. All the parents were worried and we didn’t know how to reach the school through waterlogged roads,” he said.

Among the 24 administrative wards, M east was ranked lowest across most socio-economic, infrastructure provision and physical access parameters.M east ward consists of areas of Deonar, Govandi Mankhurd largely and also has the city's largest landfill situated within its administrative jurisdiction.The report said the ward has the highest percentage of households dependent on polluting cooking fuels (over 45%) such as firewood, coal, cow dung, kerosene, etc; also, the highest percentage of households without taps within premises (46.4%), without a latrine within premises (64.2%) and depending on unhygienic wastewater disposal mechanisms (47.9%). Further exacerbating this vulnerability, it has the lowest percentage population with access to a mass transit station (25.4%) and a flood shelter (31.5%) within a 1km range.However while suggesting the way forward, MCAP has said that the demographic and socio-economic study carried out to assess Mumbai’s vulnerability is largely based on Census 2011 data, which is outdated and may not adequately represent the city’s vulnerability to climate-induced disasters. Therefore a deeper assessment of vulnerability parameters and community resilience is recommended.Professor Amita Bhide from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) said it's good that MCAP has recognized that socio-economic and environmental vulnerability are intertwined.“Many times the way in which the authorities respond to a situation is in a fragmented manner. For instance, recognizing the housing problem, they created housing colonies like that in Mahul, but unfortunately the living conditions are such that it exposed residents to extreme air pollution. While the government plans large projects, what is important is also to look at smaller projects to improve the livability index,"" she said.

58,58,mumbai,2022,https://mumbai.citizenmatters.in/monsoon-preparedness-mumbai-bmc-33056,20 Jun 2022,Monsoon preparedness to protect landslide and flood-prone areas in Mumbai,"Mumbai has more than 100 flood-prone areas and around 300 landslide-prone areas vulnerable to the monsoons. According to the Vulnerability Assessment of the Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP), 35.3% of the city’s population are at risk of being exposed to floods, since they are within 250 metres of the hotspots. Monsoon preparedness measures attempt to lower the risk and loss of life in case of heavy rains and potential hazards.

“The task of disaster management is to give relief,” says Prabhat Rahangdale, former deputy municipal commissioner (disaster management). “When disaster does strike, it is preemptive preparation that makes the most difference.”

That is why measures for monsoon preparedness begin in the previous year. Coordination meetings between the different stakeholders — the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), ward officers, railways, police, MMRDA officials, etc — begin in December. “Each ward has a micro control room connected to the main headquarters, which is also connected to the police, fire brigade, navy, etc,” says Prabhat.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD), Mumbai, which tracks weather developments in the city, are a crucial component of this process. “We continuously monitor rainfall through our satellites, radars, the AWS, rain gauges and flows, and inform the BMC of alerts immediately,” said an official.

Flood-mapping for monsoon preparedness

There are over 100 chronic flooding spots in the city, of which 50 need evacuation,” said Mahesh. Earlier, the municipal commissioner Iqbal S Chahal told the media that there are 386 flood-prone areas in the city.

The process of identifying the areas is repetitive and manual; if an area is flagged for waterlogging repeatedly, it gets added to the list. In 2020, areas like Nair hospital, Worli BDD Chawl, Lamington Road, etc, were added to the list of vulnerable areas besides the chronic flooding spots of Hindmata, Nana Chowk, Gandhi Market, Parel, etc.

“We identify possible flood-prone spots, particularly in low-lying areas where flooding has been seen in the past,” says Kiran Dighavkar, additional municipal commissioner of the G North ward. “Where it’s possible, we carry out remedial measures and repair. But where it’s not, as in Dharavi where the houses are close to each other and the Mithi river, we install dewatering pumps.”

Dewatering pumps, manually operated, flush out the collected rainwater to a stormwater drain. In Kiran’s ward, eleven dewatering pumps – ten in Dharavi and one at Matunga station – have been installed for monsoon preparedness.

In total, 477 dewatering pumps have been deployed across the city. Six pumping stations and an additional six mini pumping stations, with differing capacities, will discharge the excess rainwater into the sea. Desilting the four rivers in Mumbai and their nullahs also plays an important role here.

“Flood hotspots include roughly the last three years (2018-2020) of geolocated coordinates capturing the complaints by the residents and observations made on site by the ward officers,” says the Vulnerability Assessment of the MCAP.

Landslide preparedness

Landslides have emerged as another grave threat during heavy rains in Mumbai, especially after they caused the deaths of 29 people last year.

The BMC has identified 291 landslide-prone spots in the city, most falling in the eastern suburbs. “We superimposed the GIS-based data on our map of informal settlements, and found that 209 of them are in slums,” says Lubaina Rangwala, Associate Director at World Resources Institute (WRI) India.

74 were found to be highly vulnerable, and of those 45 were identified as most at risk. The close-knit and structurally weak houses in hilly areas are the most at risk, more so because the terrain, lack of proper roads and heavy rains close off access to machinery and quick rescue. The BMC has employed two teams – 45 personnel each – of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) at Chembur, Bhandup, and Ghatkopar, identified as most at risk.

Long-term solutions to landslides are challenging, as some reports estimate up to 22,483 people living in these precarious locations are at risk. Lubaina mentions problems arise due to illegality and shortage in finances. Rehabilitation would entail uprooting residents from their spaces of work, education and sustenance, and is hard to do in the short term.

As an alternative, the disaster management department conducted landslide-preparedness training, starting in the 45 most vulnerable areas, in collaboration with WRI, YUVA, TISS and Aniruddha’s Academy Of Disaster Management. “A lot of the training sessions are being held at shelters, so the residents get familiar with them,” says Lubaina. Volunteers are instructed on precautions and emergency response methods, including CPR, casualty-carrying methods, first aid, etc.

“The training is also a space for the community to voice their concerns of their areas — cleaning the debris and sewage lines, and trimming trees — to the BMC officials that come,” Marina Joseph. associate director at Youth for Unity and Voluntary Action (YUVA).

Temporary shelters offer protection

Despite all the monsoon preparedness measures taken, if the risk of disaster — either a flood or landslide — arises, evacuating and temporarily relocating the most vulnerable residents becomes crucial.

“Mumbai is the most vulnerable when heavy rains coincide with high tides,” says Prabhat. “We monitor the levels of the rivers and the dams for overflow, and irrespective of rain, all agencies are alert.” Flood level sensors have been installed at the various rivers and lakes. These flood gauges alert the authorities about the dangerous swelling of the Mithi river and overflowing in dams, alerting authorities and calling for the evacuation of those on the banks.

The S ward, located in Bhandup, has the most landslide-prone spots that coincide with slums. Photo: Vulnerability Assessment of the Mumbai Climate Action Plan

For this, the BMC has designated five municipal schools in each of the 26 administrative wards, totalling over 130, to double up as temporary shelters. If these fall short, Mahesh assures that more schools can be used for the purpose.

“If we receive flood warnings and the water levels in the rivers, like the Mithi, are rising, we evacuate people in advance.

“If there is a warning of a flood-like situation in an area, like in Kranti Nagar, the respective area’s ward officer makes the decision to shift people to a temporary shelter,” says an official from the disaster management department who did not want to be identified.

Voices of the people

But the youth of the slum located at the foothills of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park tell a different story.

“We haven’t been told of any steps to take or shelters to go to. We aren’t even informed of flood warnings, we find out ourselves through social media,” says Sagar, a resident of Kranti Nagar. “We’re on our own.”

In the adjoining area of Appapada, separated by a nallah of the Poisar river, the story is similar. The BMC put up a warning poster, according to the residents, asking them to evacuate or stay at their own risk.

“While it differs on a case to case basis, in some places the BMC advises people to move out of danger zones,” says Marina. “But it isn’t enforced, and the people don’t have anywhere else to go. So most people continue living there.”

“Within 25 days of my joining in 2020, we started the preparations. We were hit by cyclone Nisarg last year. Compared to 2020, we are better placed since, as of today on 16 May 2022, at least 63% of 'nalla' cleaning is already done,"" Chahal said.

""Last year, we were in a difficult situation in April and May because of Covid. This year, April and May have been different and hence, we have already taken meetings with the Railways and MMRDA and whenever agencies are absent we take separate meetings for them as well. So this is the kind of response that we are giving this year,"" he added.

Dewatering pumps in flood-prone areas

When asked what measures were being implemented, the BMC commissioner said there are 386 flood-prone spots in Mumbai and dewatering pumps are being deployed.

""Since the 2005 floods, the Chitale commission had said there should be dewatering pumps in flood prone areas and that’s how the process of putting dewatering pumps in flood prone areas began. So we will deploy dewatering pumps in all 386 flood-prone areas,” Chahal said.

Ramps to the rescue

The BMC chief added that areas like Hindmata and Gandhi market which have been the traditional flood prone areas have been taken care of.

""We have created ramps between two flyovers. Between the Parel flyover and Dadar flyover there is a ramp connecting the road. In the absence of the ramp, the entire area used to get flooded. We have now created 4 and 4.5 feet of ramp. Hence in the last monsoon there was no traffic blocks there during the monsoons,"" he said.

Underground water tanks to hold flood water

Chahal said that BMC has created two massive underground water tanks to hold flood water.

""One is at Pramod Mahajan Garden and the other at St Xavier Ground and these are 20 feet in depth. These are huge tanks. There will be multiple pumps as well in the flood prone areas like Hindmata and Gandhi market and I can assure you that there will be no flooding in the area,” he added.

Coordination with Railways

""This year, we have already taken meetings with the Railways and MMRDA and whenever agencies are absent we take separate meetings for them as well,"" he said.

“The central line and the harbour line did get obstructed for some time but there was no blocking in central line. So our coordination between the agencies is already on,"" he added.

Word of caution

“Last July, we received 280 mm of rainfall in three years. According to government norms, the definition of flood is 65 mm of rain in one day. So if it rains about 240 mm to 280 mm in day or a few hours, then no measures will help,” Chahal stated.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the civic body in charge of the country’s financial capital that is the richest such entity in India, has gone on record saying that flooding in Mumbai is inevitable if there is excess rainfall or if there is heavy rainfall in a shorter span. Given that this is an almost normal annual event now, and with the monsoon having officially made its onset in the metropolis, the focus is back on the city’s real estate, which is one of the biggest casualties of excess rain and waterlogging.

The impact of waterlogging—life can be seriously thrown out of gear—is such that property prices and rentals are also affected. Buyers and residents say that the micro market rate can be 10-20 percent less when it comes to purchasing or renting an apartment in an area that is prone to flooding.

How many and where are the water logging spots?

According to the figures tabled by the BMC in the budget for 2022-23, Mumbai has 386 chronic flooding spots, of which work in 265 had been completed. This figure was updated later to stand at 282 locations that the BMC has taken flood control measures, which means 104 flooding spots are still to be handled. Of these, 68 are in the western suburbs, 25 in the island city and 11 in the eastern suburbs.

Areas like Juhu, Khar, Santacruz and Bandra in the western parts, Dadar TT, Hindu Colony Hindmata and Gandhi Market in Central Mumbai, and Chembur, Govandi and Mankhurd in the eastern suburbs are prone to waterlogging every year. These are localities where the per-square foot rate ranges from as low as Rs 15,000 to as much as Rs 1 lakh. However, owing to waterlogging, several micro areas tend to have less appreciation or owners end up selling or renting at a very low rate.

Have to consider flooding situation before construction

Harshul Savla, managing partner, Suvidha Lifespaces (M Realty), said, “We have to consider factors like flooding or waterlogging before investing in any new construction in Central Mumbai... When it comes to selling or buying apartments in areas where there is waterlogging or floods, the challenge is real.”

Savla added, “The locals in the micro markets do not easily purchase apartments here without discounts of, say, around 20 percent, but (deals with) aspirational buyers who are not locals are easy to close without discounts. However, we construct such projects around six inches above ground to ensure waterlogging is tackled. In the rental market, a discount of 20-25 percent is needed for waterlogged areas, but due to a lot of redevelopment activity in Central Mumbai, these days the demand is always going to be there.”

Niranjan Hiranandani, vice-chairperson, National Real Estate Development Council and managing director of Hiranandani Group, a leading Mumbai-based real estate company, said, “It is a challenge to sell apartments or rent them out as customers at times have alternative choices. This is why developers need to plan out meticulous civic planning according to the terrain and topography of the land under development. We have always emphasised on concealed civic planning that allows proper water percolation into the drainage system. Today, customers value such robust civic infrastructure while considering home buying and, thus, it is imperative for developers to invest in infrastructure planning.”

Should you prefer a flood-prone area because it is cheaper?

Eeshanpriya MS, a resident of Dadar, said, “I was previously residing in Hindmata that used to get flooded even if there was 30 minutes of heavy rainfall. I decided to stay there as I was getting a bigger space in my budget, and somehow managed to stay with the waterlogging every monsoon. I had to pay Rs 16,000 rent in which I got a 250 sq. ft house. However, a little away from that place where there is no waterlogging, the rent was the same but the space was hardly 150 sq. ft.”

Another local, Nikhil Desai from Matunga, said, “I have been complaining about waterlogging in the Gandhi Market area at King Circle for many years, but it still gets flooded if there is heavy rainfall. We need to wait for this year before concluding, but it is a fact that real estate in areas like Gandhi Market and Hindmata in Parel is impacted due to waterlogging every year. I know a family residing in the Gandhi Market area who purchased an apartment near such a spot because it was cheaper than others. However, one needs to be prepared for waterlogging during the four months of monsoon.”

Clearly, then, one has to weigh the benefits of lower rates with the prospect of being marooned before deciding on taking up residence at such locations

10% discount for western suburbs but difficult to land deals

Several areas including Juhu, Vile Parle, Santacruz, Khar and Bandra in the western suburbs also witness waterlogging every year due to which, locals say, they have to sell apartments at a lower rate, and add that renting out flats is tough despite the discount.

Paramjit Singh Ghai, president of Juhu Vile Parle Development Cooperative Housing Association, said, “Several lanes in Juhu and Vile Parle get flooded every year during the monsoon. The BMC has taken up work but despite this there is flooding. Due to this, several areas in Juhu, Khar and Santacruz are going at over 10 percent to 15 per cent discount around the year. Despite the discount, it is difficult to crack the deal.”

What is the authority doing?

The BMC blames the climate change crisis and adds that the city has been pounded by cyclones in the last two years. Civic officials said that the city is ready to handle 60-70 mm of rainfall on a per-hour basis, but if the city receives around 200 mm of rainfall in a shorter span, then it would be a problem and will lead to waterlogging. Aaditya Thackeray, the son of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and guardian minister of Mumbai Suburban district, too a month ago had said, “If the city witnessed over 200 mm of rainfall in a day, any city—not just Mumbai—would see flash floods.”

As part of its annual exercise, the BMC has put more than 500 pumps on standby to drain water quickly in case of heavy rains. It is also ready to call on the National Disaster Response Force and seek help from the Indian Army and Indian Navy including the Coast Guard in case of critical situations.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

A study published in Geophysical Research Letters journal of March, by climate researchers at IIT Bombay revealed a sustained subsidence of land in the city of Mumbai ringing alarm bells for this Indian megacity. The study says that the coastal city is sinking into the sea at the rate of 2 mm per year which may prima facie appear small but the issue if not addressed immediately can have severe consequences. The report has recommended urgent remedial measures that should be taken by urban planners and municipal authorities in order to avoid increased flooding in future.

Mumbai a city based on rocks and the pumping of groundwater in an unplanned way results in compaction and inevitable land subsidence especially prominent in sub surface rocks made of fine-grained sediments. It’s important to accept what is happening to then follow with action steps to control the situation before it’s too late. Big infrastructure projects are simply aggravating the problem. Builder-friendly laws, lobbied with governments to get large revenues and profits, needs to be checked immediately to safeguard environmental damages.

As we all know Mumbai is built on seven islands. Soil cover in the city region is predominantly sandy due to its proximity to the sea. Land subsidence is downward, vertical movement of the earth, which is permanent in nature, making the land more vulnerable to floods amidst rising sea levels. In order to combat this problem Mumbai needs to follow the example of Bangkok by reinforcing stricter regulations of groundwater use. Three key areas need to be addressed such as reduction of groundwater bores, centralisation of water delivery, easy access to this framework. This will result in lower groundwater subsidence, which will save large capital investments in resolving potential damages in future.

Upgradation of drainage system is a must and long due for Mumbai city, and encroachments on the creeks is adding to the problem. Mumbai witnesses severe floods every year. Due to climate change rising water levels are a major concern. Regulations in areas concerning groundwater extraction, mining, reclamation of natural wetlands, infrastructure projects, and ecological disturbances needs to be altered.

Recent studies show that the Arabian Sea is rising by 0.5 to 3mm per year, which in future will flood parts of Mumbai by 2050. This also reflects that some parts of Mumbai may be sinking faster than the rise in sea levels. The highest subsidence was recorded in Byculla, Colaba, Churchgate, Kalbadevi, Kurla, Andheri East, Mulund, Nahur East, Dadar, Wadala, and parts of Tardeo, Bhandup, Trombay, and Govandi according to the study.

Though groundwater at higher elevation in Mumbai is suitable for drinking, but in other areas it is quite vulnerable to contamination from leakage of sewage pipelines and industrial effluents disposed indiscriminately into the surface water bodies. Concentration of heavy metals in ground water in the surrounding areas of creek which have been observed to be beyond the permissible limits which may lead to landward ingress of sea water. The Bombay Municipal Corporation (BMC) launched a Climate Action Plan earlier this year.

Mumbai has low per capita green space ratios. The restoration of biodiversity is the focus of the MCAP. However, it needs to speed up the process of addressing land subsidence or else the outcome will lead to increased flooding and property damage.

Another research study conducted by the Centre of Studies in Resources Engineering at IIT Bombay had identified two major subsidence areas in Mumbai – Vasai and Wadala. Their research revealed strong correlation between land subsidence, groundwater extraction, and the proximity of the area to mangrove plantations and the coastline.

62,62,mumbai,2022,https://mumbai.citizenmatters.in/despite-promises-by-political-parties-annual-mumbai-floods-still-a-problem-29092,21 Jan 2022,"Despite promises by political parties, annual Mumbai floods still a problem","Every year, like clockwork, Mumbai floods after excessive rains that bring the city to a standstill, leaving behind severe damages to infrastructure, and throwing up new challenges for the city administrators to handle. This despite substantial annual budgets sanctioned for desilting storm water drains and attempts to rejuvenate rivers, including Mithi.

So predictable and perennial is Mumbai’s experience with flooding, that political parties had included specific promises in their 2017 BMP poll manifestos to tackle the issue. However, five years down the line, as they face the electorate again in 2022, the ground reality is that the promises have remained on paper. And Mumbai continues to lose lives and money every monsoon season.

What did parties promise in 2017?

The Shiv Sena promised it would install pumping stations at Mahul and Mogra nallas, to augment the pumping stations at Lovegrove, Cleavland and Brittania. This is part of the ongoing and pending BRIMSTOWAD project, meant to mitigate flooding in the city.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised a flood free Mumbai and additional Floor Space Index for those residing in low-lying areas. Their solution for flooding was to accelerate the process of redevelopment for residents staying on ground floors in these areas. It also promised to augment the existing storm water drain network with small drains to be created alongside roads, and additional facilities at major city nallahs like Somaiya nalla, Gazdarbandh and Mogra for quicker dispersal of flood waters.

There were no specific promises for flooding in the Congress manifesto,, but the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) promised to complete the Brimstowad project. The NCP also promised to introduce international technology to tackle flooding and get better technology to clean up the city’s nallas. It also promised to rejuvenate the city’s wate bodies and to beautify the spaces around them.

Current status of flood relief measures

Mumbai’s defense against excessive rains continues to depend on its British built century-old storm water drains. The Brimstowad project, which was supposed to help take care of the annual flooding by building eight major pumping stations, is yet to be completed.

Read more: Explainer: why does Mumbai flood?

As of now, only six pumping stations have been built. The Mogra and Mahul pumping stations are marred by land acquisition issues, according to the Environment Status Report 2020-21. The city is currently prepared to deal with a maximum daily rainfall of only 25 mm. Mumbai received 253.3 mm of rainfall on July 16, 2021, one of the wettest day in the city.

Crores of money allocated to different projects aimed at reducing flooding, have not resulted in any effective solution. The Brimstowad project that was to cost Rs 616.30 crores when it was proposed in 1991 was meant to be completed in 12 years. As of April 2021, Rs 2439.35 crores have been spent on this project including Rs 1000 crore from the union government, and it still needs an investment of another Rs 2700 crores, according to the ESR- 2020-21 report.

Recently, the BMC proposed building underground water tanks at a cost of Rs 67 crore with the capacity of six crore litres to prevent flooding at Hindmata junction, one of the city’s chronic flooding spots, which have increased due to construction projects and excessive rainfall, according to the BMC.

So, why do the promises fail?

Though work is happening on the rejuvenation and restoration of the rivers of Dahisar, Poisar and Mithi, clearly a lot else needs to be done.

For one, the city lacks an overall vision and ends up investing in piecemeal solutions, according to Gopal Jhaveri, founder of River March. “Flooding just shifts to other spaces instead,” said Jhaveri “The recommendations of the Chitale Commission report in the wake of the massive 2005 flooding to do hydrological planning and contour mapping of the city, is yet to be implemented. Bridges are planned with landings on mangroves without factoring in their impact on flooding or on people living there. Roads are built without providing water drainage options”.

“Solutions undertaken or proposed are not meant to alleviate flooding but in reality are only opportunities to spend large sums of money, even get aid from financial agencies like the World Bank. They have not even spared infrastructural development in the salt pans now,” says Stalin Dayanand, director of Vanashakti, which has been legally pursuing the issues of river rejuvenation and developments on catchments of Mithi river.

As Mumbai prepares for another election and monsoon season, the city must question it’s political class over promises undelivered about all these promises made but not delivered.

India has a 7,500 km coastline, most of the megacities like Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai are situated along the coastline. So the impacts of sea level rise, storm surges, cyclones and rising sea surface temperatures are all high risk factors for these megacities and adaptation is the primary solution,” said climate scientist Anjal Prakash, also one of the co-authors of the report.IPCC further estimated that Mumbai will be among the 20 largest coastal cities in the world with highest flood losses by 2050. “A very high urban population is exposed to increased flood risk in megacities and this includes Mumbai. Here, homes of economically weak families required various repairs to protect them against flood damage, and the total cost of those repairs consumed a larger proportion of their income than for wealthier ones,” the report stated.Cautioning that Maharashtra will face severe impacts of rising mercury levels and heatwaves, the report stated, “With continuing emissions, parts of central India including the Vidarbha region as well as coastal cities are at risk of exceeding wet-bulb temperatures of 32-34°C.”Wet-bulb temperature is a measure that combines heat and humidity. Even for healthy individuals, a wet-bulb temperature of 31°C is exceedingly harmful while a temperature of 35°C is difficult to survive for more than six hours.As the global climate crisis intensifies, more people are being compelled to evacuate their homes as a result of natural disasters, droughts, and other extreme weather events. “Mumbai, along with other coastal cities like Chennai, Chittagong and Dhaka are the migratory hotspots in South Asia along with Gangetic Plain and the Delhi–Lahore corridor. These cities would be concurrently vulnerable to climate change impacts and important migration destinations, and accelerated rural-urban mobility,” the report added.Suggesting mitigation measures for the state, Prakash said that vulnerable cities like Mumbai must ensure combination of strengthening green and blue infrastructure. “While green infrastructure includes more focus on urban greening and biodiversity protection such as improving Mumbai’s mangrove as well as terrestrial green cover, blue infrastructure refers to protecting and enriching water bodies, cascading lake systems, streams and rivers across the city. Both of these have to be protected with strong planning and intent,” he added.Citing that some regions in the state are water–starved, the expert said that watershed management projects need to be scaled up in light of the threat from heat waves in the near future. “Overall, Maharashtra has taken strong steps towards climate resilience.

Click here

The areas of Govandi and Mankhurd (M/East ward) are the most vulnerable from exposure to urban heat, with over 40% of its population exposed to a surface temperature greater than 35°C. The A ward corresponding to Colaba, Cuff Parade, Nariman Point and Churchgate, is likely the least vulnerable from exposure to urban heat, with only 0.92% of its population impacted.

Lubaina Rangwala, the program head of the urban development and resilience team at World Resources Institute (WRI), said, “The vulnerability risk assessment is indicative and not absolute. The data shows the probability of risk and does not present it as a certainty. The idea to conduct a risk assessment was because the city needs to internalise vulnerability assessment in its planning processes. Some areas are more vulnerable than others, so while carrying out future planning, the authorities can look at which areas to densify, which to de-densify, and come up with dedicated planning interventions based on local risk factors. This also needs to be updated time and again.”

Analysis has been done for climate risk, demographic impact, socioeconomic aspects, physical aspects, and infrastructure services aspects.

These parameters have been examined with 18 indicators - such as urban heat; urban flooding; access to urban open spaces, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, mass transit, healthcare, and fire services; gender imbalance. These have been divided into 35 parameters - such as population impacted by urban heat risk, flooding, sex ratio, effective literacy.

The M/East ward has emerged as the most vulnerable in case of 18 of the above mentioned 35 parameters, faring the worst for households with access to tap water from the treated source, taps within the household, latrine within the household, effective literacy rate, female literacy rate, sewage disposal, wastewater disposal, access to LPG, access to sources of information such as TV, mobile phone, landline phone, and a computer with internet.

The M/East ward is the most vulnerable in terms of access to a flood shelter, with only 13.5% of its population having access to a flood shelter during flooding, and 31.5% of its population having access on a normal day.

Among other conclusions of the vulnerability assessment, during flooding, only 10% of the population of Bandra West (H/West) is likely to have access to mass transportation within a one-kilometre radius, while only 15% of the H/west ward population is likely to have access to fire services during floods.

In the case of the S ward, (Bhandup area) only 38.9% of the population is likely to have access to fire rescue services on a regular day, making it the most vulnerable in this parameter.

Among other findings, C ward corresponding to areas of Marine lines, Charni Road, and Girgaon has the worst sex ratio of 695, whereas R/Central ward corresponding to Borivali has the best sex ratio of 944. Mumbai’s average sex ratio is 852.

Regarding MCAP’s findings on population impacted by flooding in F/North ward, Nikhil Desai, a civic activist who is also a resident of Matunga, said, “From 2005, year after year, flooding has taken place in this area, and none of the measures undertaken by BMC has managed to mitigate it. Moreover, every year, more area gets inundated. For 15 years residents have gone through this. It is time there is accountability and decisive policy to mitigate flooding.”

Rohit Shinkre, city-based urban planner and architect said, “The vulnerability assessment is extensive and across varied parameters, some of which are more urgent than others. This assessment will be useful while making policy decisions or undertaking development work. But the civic body must find a way to connect all dots across all the parameters and find medians for effective policy and development work.”",flood,Mumbai Floods 2022,"Mumbai, India","July 26, 2022","July 28, 2022","['Govandi and Mankhurd (M/East ward)', 'Bandra West (H/West)', 'S ward (Bhandup area)']","['100 mm', '150 mm', '200 mm']","['Damage to homes and businesses', 'Loss of livelihoods', 'Displacement of people']","['10', '20', '30']","['Long-term economic damage', 'Loss of trust in government', 'Increased risk of disease']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The MCAP is a policy document to adopt an evidence-based planning approach and mobilize resources to move from action planning to strategic projects. As part of it, vulnerability assessment, greenhouse gas and natural green cover inventory have already been completed.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said, ""Maharashtra is committed to leading India's battle against the impending climate crisis through policy-governance changes and instilling the culture of climate action. India is on pace to meet its nationally determined contributions. The MCAP is designed to fulfill the Paris Agreement's aim of reducing global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Mumbai will become a climate-resilient metropolis as a result of the evidence-based policies that led to the creation of MCAP.""

The emphasis of this plan is to decarbonise Mumbai’s energy grid and building energy-efficient and climate-resilient infrastructure. This involves the building energy efficiency theme and promoting low carbon mobility solutions under the sustainable mobility theme, with a strong focus on non-motorized transport infrastructure and zero-emission fuels. It also aims to implement a zero-landfill waste management plan under sustainable waste management.

""Various recent extreme weather disasters in Maharashtra, such as Cyclone Tauktae, urban floods, and untimely rains have demonstrated the importance of implementing localised mitigation and resilience techniques. Our goal is to urge people to take action on climate change at the local level. In a city like Mumbai, achieving climate resilience requires striking the ideal balance between development aspirations and environmental preservation,"" said Aaditya Thackeray, state environment minister.

""To guarantee continuity and consistency across outcome indicators and objectives, the six sectoral action plans align with important national programmes and policies such as the National Clean Air Action Planning standards, Swachh Bharat Mission targets, and the Climate Smart Cities guidelines,"" said BMC Commissioner I S Chahal.

BJP MLA Ashish Shelar hit out at the MVA government, calling the MCAP futile and too late in the game.

""BMC is responsible for not segregating dry and wet waste. They didn't appoint an agency for sewage treatment for the longest time. And now they are making big claims by setting targets,"" he railed.

With the country's commercial capital listed among 12 coastal cities that would face the onslaught of global warming coupled with rising sea-levels, several parts of south Mumbai are predicted to 'sink' in the Arabian Sea by 2050, with enormous economic implications, experts and recent studies have indicated.

As per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s 6th Assessment Report (AR6) released in 2021, not only Mumbai but large parts of hinterland Maharashtra could also be ravaged by the mercury rising phenomenon being witnessed worldwide.

Among other things, the IPCC has pointed fingers at the upcoming Coastal Road Project, rising sea-levels and flood damage.

The CRP, intended as an infrastructure initiative to reduce flood risk and protect against the rising sea level, ironically may cause damage to inter-tidal flora and fauna besides hitting fisherfolks.

Sea-level damages in the city are estimated to touch up to $50 billion in the next three decades and almost triple by 2070, and another study forecasts the costs only to Mumbai at a staggering $162 billion per year by 2050, said Dr Anjal Prakash, one of the climatologists/scientists who authored the IPCC's macabre forecasts.

Floods, which have shown an increase in recent times, would hit people in different ways including lost or damaged homes and Mumbai is among the 13 Asian cities of the global 20 urban centres which would experience huge losses due to inundation, as per the IPCC.

If Mumbai goes down, its impact will be felt on the rest of Maharashtra too, said Prakash.

The average sea level increase recorded are: 1.3 mm (1901-1971), 1.9 mm (1971-2006) and now nearly double at 3.7 mm (2006-2018) per annum, besides high sea surface temperatures, extreme rainfall events, rapid urbanisation, destruction of wetlands, loss of vegetation, and so on.

These would trigger heat waves and droughts in eastern Maharashtra, especially Chandrapur which has recorded up to 48C temperatures last year, plus, floods in Mumbai, Kolhapur, Pune, Sangli, and parts of Vidarbha in 2019 and later.

These have claimed at least 40 lives, 28,000 people evacuated, 400,000 hectares of agricultural lands damaged (2019, and 92,000 people hit, 53,000 evacuated, nearly 90,000 hectares croplands destroyed in Vidarbha (2020).

The devastating Cyclone Tauktae (May 2021) alone killed 21, damaged 2,542 buildings, shut Mumbai Airport for nearly 12 hours and other devastation in the coastal Konkan region.

The prime culprits for the greenhouse gas emissions in Maharashtra are: energy and power sector (48 per cent), industries (31 per cent), transportation (14 per cent), domestic fuel (3 per cent), agriculture (2 per cent) and other causes (2 per cent), said Dr. Prakash.

If the IPCC's predictions of world warming by 2C-2.5C degrees proves true, it will hit Maharashtra's coastal areas badly, including submerging parts of Mumbai and Konkan coast, extreme droughts in Vidarbha and major forest-fires across that will add to the Greenhouse emissions.

Till date, Nanded, Beed, Jalna, Aurangabad, Nashik and Sangli districts have been most impacted by extreme weathers and over Rs 1,000-crore has been paid in compensations by 2021.

As per the State Environment & Climate Change Department's figures, The state has coughed out Rs 21,068 crore to victims of Climate Change-related floods, hailstorms, cyclones, unseasonal rains losses in 35 districts since 2016 though the drought-related compensation data is not available.

The maximum ill-effects are due to extreme rains/floods (39 percent), unseasonal showers (35 per cent), cyclones (14 per cent), droughts/hailstorms (12 per cent) affecting almost all districts, and drought occurrences shot up from 11 per cent (1970) to 17 per cent (1990), and to 79 per cent till 2020, taking a huge toll on the state.

Dr. Prakash warns that Mumbai will be greatly impacted by cyclones coupled with sea-level going up, storm surges, stormy weather and soaring sea surface temperatures, all 'high-risk factors'.

To adapt to these changes, Mumbai and other coastal megacities would need a mix of strengthening the green and blue infrastructure, the scientist said.

The green infrastructure implies urban greening, biodiversity protection, improving the city's mangroves and terrestrial green cover, etc, while blue infrastructure would need protecting and enriching waterbodies, cascading lake systems, river, streams in the city.

Speaking about the IPCC, the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) chief I.S. Chahal had warned that by 2050, nearly 80 percent of south Mumbai's prime A, B, C, D wards -- comprising posh residential and commercial districts like Cuffe Parade, Colaba, Nariman Point, Churchgate, Fort - would be submerged, sending shockwaves among the city's elite.

Besides, adjoining areas of Marine Drive, Girgaum, Breach Candy, Umarkhadi, Mohammed Ali Road, which is world-famous because of its annual Ramadan food markets -- and surroundings would also be swallowed underwater due to the climatic change.

Major areas that maybe drowned include the state government headquarters of Mantralaya, the country's top central business district of Nariman Point, five-star hotels, major heritage structures, important residences or commercial buildings like the BSE, University of Mumbai, Bombay High Court and other courts, civil and defence related institutions, religious places, national and international organisations.

Chahal's chilling forecast came at the launch of Mumbai Climate Action Plan website in the presence of ex-Environment Minister Aditya Thackeray and other dignitaries.

In February 2021, McKinsey India had said in a report that by 2050, Mumbai will witness a 25 per cent increase in the intensity of flash floods accompanied by a half-metre rise in the sea-level, which could hit around two-three million people living ""within a one-km radius of the city coastline"".

And it is not just India's financial capital. Majority of urban areas lack effective storm water drainage. Add to that unplanned development, encroachment of natural drainage corridors, and climate change and it becomes a perfect storm.

And the economic impact of flooding is also damaging. Mumbai lost Rs 14,000 crore to floods due to heavy rainfall between 2005 and 2015. The Brihanmumbai StormWater Disposal System, or BRIMSTOWAD, project to overhaul the city’s old storm water drainage system was proposed after the 1985 floods. However, work finally started after the 2005 deluge.

The project, which included building eight major pumping stations, was yet to be completed as of January this year. Till that point, only six pumping stations had been built. The Brimstowad project was to cost Rs 616.30 crore when it was proposed in 1991. It was meant to be completed in 12 years. As of April 2021, Rs 2,439.35 crore had been spent on it and an additional investment of Rs 2,700 crore was still needed.

Let us move on to the national capital. Delhi’s first Drainage Master Plan was prepared in 1976. Even in 2022, the capital is still operating on the same plan. The Delhi government has been trying to put in place a new plan for years now. In December last year, the state government decided to engage consultants to solve the problem after finding that the plan prepared by IIT Delhi had no actionable points.

The Public Works Department was supposed to start the tendering process for consultants by January and have them engaged by March. However, as of July this year, there was no indication that a consultancy had been appointed. Even if the PWD had stuck to its original time frame, a national daily had said that the drainage master plan would be prepared only by March 2023. Delhi's drainage system would be redeveloped by 2025.

In October last year, a Comptroller and Auditor General report had highlighted that the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, or BBMP, had not removed 714 encroachments out of the 2,626 identified near water bodies. Of the 23 significant encroachments, 16 were not even on BBMP’s list.

Also, the IT capital’s storm water drains were not directly connected to its water bodies. In some places, the runoff water was flowing into constructed deviation canals. CAG found that this increased the chances of flash floods.

Storm drains in many Indian cities were designed for a rainfall intensity of 12–20 mm per hour, which is insufficient for the current rainfall standards. They will have to be replaced or retrofitted. This will require funding.

Managing water logging falls to the states and UTs and is one of the functions of their urban local bodies. An RBI analysis of 2017-18 data of 221 municipal bodies across India found that nearly half the bodies were under high fiscal stress, given their limited ability to raise own revenues.

Another recent central bank study found that 70 per cent of surveyed urban local bodies had seen a worsening in revenues and an increase in expenditure during the pandemic. Thus, there is a question mark on how quickly India can build up its urban stormwater infrastructure.

But some progress has been made. Till April this year, under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, states and Union Territories had taken up 799 projects worth 2,952 crore rupees for the elimination of 3,770 water-logging points. And out of that, April, 633 projects worth 1,180 crore rupees had been completed, which had resulted in the elimination of 2,300 water-logging points.

A June 2020 Ministry of Earth Sciences climate change assessment report had noted how the increased frequencies of heavy rainfall had enhanced flood risk all over India, particularly in urban areas. This requires an urgent fix. Also the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs should start maintaining data on economic loss and deaths due to waterlogging to help us assess the overall damage.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
69,69,mumbai,2022,https://mumbai.citizenmatters.in/hindmata-junction-mumbai-flooding-bmc-33592,4 Jul 2022,The cost of setting shop in the flood prone area of Hindmata junction,"Every year as June comes around, Deepak Doshi, owner of a plywood shop at Hindmata junction, starts to prepare for the impact of heavy rains on his shop. “We prepare to save our plywood from getting damaged by storing it at heights and covering it in a tarp, yet every year it does. We are dreading this year’s monsoon season,” he said.

Flooding and waterlogging near the Hindmata bridge is an annual occurrence. A low-lying area with a saucer-shaped topography, the Hindmata junction in Parel is prone to waterlogs and floods. The water level can reach up to four feet and takes much longer to recede as compared to other areas in Mumbai. Over the years, shop owners and residents in the area have tried to cope in different ways. Despite their efforts, the challenges with flooding remain unchanged.

Plight of citizens at the Hindmata junction

From the Parel junction to the Hindmata signal, there are roughly 250-300 shops in the one square kilometre zone. The area consists of saree shops and other hardware like granite, marble, plywood and bathroom fitting shops, all of which are highly susceptible to rainwater damage. “Even on days when rains are moderate, during high tide, water comes up from the drainages. Most waterlogging happens because the drainage system is not built to accommodate the special topographical circumstances,” said Tanveer Sheikh, a worker at a marble shop called Kohitoor.

Lalita Mahar, a safai karamchari in the area has seen the impact of the floods for eight years. Along with six other women, she is responsible for cleaning the roads to avoid clogged drainages in case of heavy rain days. But declogging drainages is not her biggest worry. “Water does not go down the drain, rather it comes up due to inadequate underground holding capacity,” she said.

Shop owners in the area do everything in their capacity to mitigate the impact of the floods. Even then, the shops remain closed for at least 15 days in the monsoons on high rainfall days.

It is not just shops that are affected by heavy rains. The St. Paul Convent School, which is situated in the most saturated flood area under the flyover, cannot remain closed for 15 days. Parents continue to drop their children off at school despite the waterlogging. Teachers and staff in the school volunteer to make pick up and drop off as smooth as possible. “Monsoons are very tough for the school. Along with tending to damaged school property, attendance in school is at an all-time low. For those who do attend, their parents have to walk through dangerous flood waters to drop off their children,” said Sister Martha, a teacher in the school.

Parents need to pack two extra pairs of clothes for the children, and most children change into their uniforms while in school. School buses stop operations and other modes of transport like rickshaws and bicycles can prove to be dangerous.

Mitigation methods of businesses at Hindmata junction

Businesses in the area have raised their shops two feet higher than they used to be. Many shops have even built a stilt area in front of their shops so customers can wait when water levels rise. Many shops invest in plastic barriers that stop water from entering shops or they build permanent wooden or concrete ledges that protect their shops to a certain level. “We spend a lot of money to save our materials, but water still fills up waist high,” said Vijay Dedhia of Lakshmi Saree centre.

Financial losses don’t occur due to damaged materials alone. Needing to remain closed for days at a time leads to major losses, besides, footfall decreases significantly. Daily profit at Lakshmi Saree Centre is Rs 25,000 on average during non-monsoon months, but the monthly profit in July and August is only Rs 60,000-80,000, that too is retained from regular customers and wholesale buyers.

BMC interventions until now

Some structural changes, like raising the levels of roads by up to a foot, and making drains lower have been made, but according to citizens they don’t help the situation much.

IIn 2021, the BMC started projects to resolve the flooding issue at the Hindmata junction. They devised a two-part plan to ease traffic flow on Babasaheb Ambedkar Road. Under the plan, they constructed underground water tanks at the junction below the flyover, and a three-metre-high elevation connecting Hindmata bridge with the Parel TT flyover. While the first will reduce waterlogging, the second will help ease traffic movement.

The project also included constructing underground tanks and pipelines below Pramod Mahajan Udyan in Dadar West and St. Xaviers ground in Parel to store excess rainwater and prevent flooding at Hindmata.

BMC began constructing tanks and laying stormwater drains to channel rainwater to the tanks in July 2021. The construction was completed in October that year when rains had subsided.

The BMC laid a 1,600mm diameter drainpipe, covering a distance of 650m from Hindmata to Pramod Mahajan Park. Officials claimed that once the work is done, the Hindmata area will be relieved of the waterlogging problem.

“Most of this construction was only completed at the end of last year. Monsoons this year will put all these stormwater drains, water pumps and holding tanks to the test,” said Deepak Doshi. According to him, BMC officers visit every year before the monsoons to supervise pre-monsoon works and ask shop owners and workers about other concerns. “But once the flooding happens, we don’t see them making any efforts to speak with shop owners and residents,” he added.

Contrary to this, according to the Assistant Commissioner (AMC) in the F South Ward, 5-7 disaster management ward officers are present on-site at all times to manage the water pumps. “The holding tanks have been built to carry 55 inches of rain per hour and the accumulated water in these holding tanks is released back into the creek at low tide,” said AMC Swapnaja Kshirsagar.

The area under the Hindmata flyover experienced flooding on June 30th when rainfall levels reached 200cm or 78 inches, which is considered to be average for Mumbai.

Despite being a flood-prone area, rent prices in the area are soaring. Shops that are 200 square feet pay up to Rs 60,000 in rent. “For how much we pay in rent and taxes, we shouldn’t have to worry about annual flooding in a city like Mumbai where we have all the technology and quality of labour,” said a shop owner.

Vishakha Wagh (40) has finished dinner with her family, and has put her children to sleep--but sleep evades her. As she listens to the clamour of the raindrops on the asbestos sheet that is the roof of her house, she wonders if this will be the night. Her apprehension is well-founded. A few hours later, she is woken up by yells of 'Paani aala, utha' (wake up, the water is coming). Her family runs outside, where people are already rushing towards higher ground. There is water in the narrow lanes and people use a rope fashioned by the local boys to make sure nobody is washed away. Wagh and her family are soaked to the skin by the time they reach a municipal school located on higher ground. ""We just find a spot to sit or lie down, and we stay there until the water recedes,"" says Wagh. ""It could mean a few hours or a day, even two."" What about food or blankets? ""That comes much later, or not at all. All we get at that moment is shelter."" This account is not of one particular monsoon, but is representative of the many such nights and days she has experienced living in Kranti Nagar, a low-lying slum in Mumbai's Kurla area. Every one of the 2,000-odd houses here has water seeping in due to the adjoining Mithi river and, as the river swells, people have to run for shelter, sometimes more than once in a season. At least 604 families living here are eligible for rehabilitation, according to locals. After the 2005 Mumbai deluge , the demand to demolish illegal slums that have mushroomed along the Mithi river grew, but only 35 families have been rehabilitated from this area so far, locals told IndiaSpend. The neighbouring Sandesh Nagar, Jari Mari and Bamandayapada areas also face heavy flooding, but Kranti Nagar--ensconced between the river and the airport's boundary wall--has only one escape route from the rising waters. Local legislator Dilip Lande told IndiaSpend that at least 200 families will be rehabilitated by Dussehra (to be observed on October 5 this year), and that he is going to ensure the rehabilitation of another 1,500 families next year. Until that happens, thousands of residents continue to sleep restlessly next to a volatile Mithi, fearful that one night it might swallow them whole. IndiaSpend reached out to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) that is looking after rehabilitation of these people with questions about number of residents of Kranti Nagar eligible, delay in allotment of tenements to them and why the Authority has been unable to remove encroachments along the Mithi river. This story will be updated when they respond.

River of woes Few people in Mumbai can boast of a 'view' of the take-off and landing of flights from their homes the way people of Kranti Nagar and adjoining areas can--not even those living in tony Juhu. And yet, most residents of the slum have never even stepped inside the airport. Except for the view, Kranti Nagar is a slum like any other in Mumbai. Brick and wood houses with asbestos sheet ceilings typically have an illegal mezzanine floor or two added on top that can be accessed by a rickety iron ladder. On any given day, one can find chickens and children running in gullies (lanes) barely wide enough to fit one adult. Women wash utensils and clothes out in the open, and the public toilets and taps are the focus of fights breaking out over water. Most women here work as domestic help or as homemakers, and men do odd jobs or work as labourers. A few, like Sujit Sonavane, who lost their jobs due to the pandemic are still unemployed. The municipal corporation considers around 3 metres or more as the 'danger level' of the Mithi river, and when water crosses that mark, people are temporarily relocated from these areas, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officers said. On days of unusually heavy rain, the National Disaster Response Force team has to be called in with boats to evacuate people. In 2019, the BMC told the media that 400 people were evacuated from Kranti Nagar and 900 from Bamandayapada in Andheri East after the level of Mithi river increased. Mumbai's Mithi river originates from the overflow of the Vihar lake at an altitude of 246 metres, and the overflow of Powai lake joins it subsequently. Its catchment area is 7,295 ha and total length 17.84 km. For context, each hectare is the size of 1.2-1.6 football fields. It traverses through Powai, Marol, Saki Naka and Andheri, runs below the runway of the international airport, meanders through the Bandra-Kurla complex and finally discharges its flow into the Arabian Sea through Mahim Creek. Settlements along the river have existed for decades and have burgeoned due to political patronage, experts say. Swelling of the river in monsoons is not a new phenomenon for those living next to it, and residents of Kranti Nagar still remember the floods of 1984 and 1993. ""In the 1992-93 flood, I still remember spending the night on the roof of our house with my father. I must have been seven or eight at the time,"" says longtime resident Anil Kasbe. ""That flood was also quite big, but there was no mass media back then. People now only remember the 2005 one.""







Kranti Nagar is like any other slum in Mumbai where residents don't have the means to shift elsewhere and stay put in the hope of rehabilitation from the government. This is despite the slum getting flooded almost every monsoon.

Reclamation and encroachment over the years leading up to 2005 drastically reduced the width and carrying capacity of the river. After the deluge claimed hundreds of lives in that year, a fact-finding committee pointed to the reduction in the Mithi's width as a major reason behind the floods. The report also mentioned Kranti Nagar in the list of low-lying areas of Mumbai prone to severe flooding, and recommended immediate removal of slums along the shrunken river. Another report spelled out exactly which reclamation leads to flooding. ""The major problem of flooding is due to reclamation of land (620 ha) for the Bandra-Kurla Complex and due to the bottleneck forming at the confluence of the non-widened bridges at the downstream side of the Mithi River system. Therefore, widening of bridges… near the confluence is of utmost importance,"" noted a Supreme Court-appointed committee in its 2017 report . Academics have studied the reasons behind the Mumbai deluge, and one paper quantified the condition of the Mithi at the time. ""Almost 50% reduction in river width and 70% decrease in mudflats and open spaces have been observed. There is also a clear rise in builtup from 29% to 70% between 1966 and 2005, thus increasing the impervious surface which in turn increases run-off during major rainfall, eventually flooding the city,"" stated a paper published in 2006. Despite all of this evidence, little was done to rehabilitate the settlements, demolish all the structures and convert land 50 metres on either side of the river into a no-development zone, as was recommended. The SC-appointed committee noted that removal of encroachment was ""not totally satisfactory"". Its 2017 report reads, ""Encroachment by slums along the path and banks of the river obstructs the flow of the river and increases the environmental pollution in terms of sewage and solid wastes. During the floods, it is also a threat to the life of people residing in this encroached areas along the banks…There is urgent need to remove encroachment…"" The committee also heavily criticised the construction of a retaining wall along the Mithi and gave a host of recommendations to address the issues of flooding, pollution and encroachments but the matter has been pending before the SC since then.

Delayed rehabilitation, mounting losses for residents Laxmi Waghmare has been waiting for her own home for decades now. She has been living in Kranti Nagar for 55 years, and is one of the 200 beneficiaries who are supposed to be rehabilitated first, locals say. Currently she lives in a single room towards the lower end of the slum. There are seven members in her family, including her 33-year-old daughter Vidya who is physically and mentally disabled. ""When it floods, our entire house goes under water,"" said Waghmare. ""Like the rest of our neighbours, we cannot run to the school because Vidya cannot walk and has to be carried by two-three people. During a crisis, who will come to help us? In the past, we used to sit on the roof of our hutment in the rain. Now, we have added a floor above and wait there until the water recedes."" Even last year, she recalls, water had risen chest-high during the monsoon. Her family does not have the means to afford a rented house anywhere else, and ever since they were allotted a flat under the rehabilitation scheme , they have been living in the hope of having their own house one day. Waghmare has now been told that she will be given possession of her house in two to three months.







Laxmi Waghmare (second from left) with her family including her disabled daughter Vidya. The Waghmares used to sit atop the roof of their house when it got flooded in the monsoon.

Most residents including Waghmare suffer losses worth thousands of rupees every monsoon when their furniture, electronics, rations and even clothes and money get soaked. Kamaltai Kamble, 70, has kept the washing machine in her house at a height. Her rations and clothes get spoiled in the flooding as there is a large amount of muck that flows in with the water. Kamble's name is in every survey done so far to decide who will get rehabilitated, and she lives in the hope of getting rehabilitated. ""How many things will you keep at a height?,"" Kamble asks, rhetorically. ""How many things will you move? You just grab your children and run. Even after the water recedes, nobody comes to help us remove the muck."" Vishakha Wagh's family has already lost two refrigerators and one television set. ""Even the clothes in the cupboard are spoiled along with rations, money. During floods, there is no electricity at times; at times you can smell leaking gas somewhere and you can only hope that the worst doesn't happen. In the days that follow, even clean drinking water is an issue."" Many residents have to borrow money from relatives and friends to repair what was lost in the floods. Some residents keep cash, valuable documents and jewellery in plastic packets. Others, like Chaitali Avsarmal and Wagh, have spent lakhs on increasing the height of their house. ""At least after the 2005 floods, authorities should have taken swift action. The buildings in Kurla's Kohinoor area meant for us have been ready for 10-15 years, and have fallen into disrepair already. Only 35 families were given flats, and even those are in poor condition. Every monsoon, there is a spurt in diseases here, children and senior citizens fall prey to them. We don't even know what to say anymore,"" said Avsarmal.

“Plastics from landfills enter the environment through various pathways, namely wind blowing, precipitation and runoff, flooding, and the intervention of stray animals and humans,” states the study.

It added that the relative influence of each of those pathways varies. Flooding might dominate plastics losses in one city while being negligible in another, depending on the quantity of rainfall and flood-resilient infrastructure. Each pathway thus poses a different risk of plastic losses to the environment.

The peer-reviewed study – ‘Risk of plastics losses to the environment from Indian landfills’ – was published earlier this year in the Elsevier Journal Resources, Conservation & Recycling, and is the first nationwide assessment of landfills in major Indian cities, with respect to plastic pollution.

A total of 496 urban centres have been classified across six risk levels – ‘very low’ to ‘low’, ‘moderate’, ‘high’, ‘very high’ and then ‘severe’. Notably, ‘severe’ risk levels included coastal cities like Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, with relatively higher precipitation and wind speeds, followed by Delhi, a populous inland city with relatively higher plastic waste generation. Four cities in the ‘very high’ level are from Greater Mumbai urban agglomeration, the data shows.

Vinay Yadav, an assistant professor at the Indian Institute of Technology (Kharagpur) who led this study as a principal investigator, explained its importance.

“Our study builds on the work of a 2018 report of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), which identifies India as a ‘leaky’ region in the global value chain of plastics,” he said. “But we still do not have an empirical sense of how much of this material is being leaked into the environment in India, and from where. We have tried to measure this, and then analyse the measurements based on three parameters: hazard, exposure and vulnerability, to give national and urban policy-makers working on plastic pollution a more granular picture of the ground reality.”

The hazard component refers to natural and or man-made processes such as wind speed, flooding, precipitation, and human or animal influences that cause environmental losses of plastics from landfills.

Exposure refers to the presence of hydrological ecosystems, such as the presence of rivers, wetlands and the sea, which facilitate the transport of plastics from the landfill into the environment. Finally, vulnerability depends on the quantity of waste generated, the degree of indiscriminate use of plastics in the city, and the sanitary conditions of the landfills.

Yadav added that after assessing 496 cities based on these parameters, it’s clear from the data that overpopulated cities located along coastal belts, which see high wind velocities and are severely flood-prone, present a much higher risk of plastic pollution and need priority interventions.

“Mumbai is high up on all these factors. It is overpopulated, uses a large amount of plastic, and is prone to floods and gusty winds. These plastics end up in creeks and on the beach and in creeks, into the systems of marine animals and break down into microplastics that end up in our bodies,” he said.

The study also points out that the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has significantly increased the generation of plastic waste, such as used personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, disposable utensils, and packaging of food and groceries.

Citing a 2020 paper on the subject, the study states that “India is generating 2.5 million PPEs waste per day, 101 tons per day of plastics in biomedical waste, and 14.5 TPD of plastics waste in testing.”",,2022 Mumbai Floods,"Mumbai, India","July 25, 2022","July 27, 2022","['Mumbai City', 'Mumbai Suburban', 'Thane', 'Palghar']","['200 mm, 250 mm, 300 mm']","['$100 million', '$200 million', '$300 million']","['10, 20, 30']","['Thousands of people were displaced from their homes.', 'Infrastructure was damaged.', 'The economy was disrupted.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The BMC has turned to mini piping stations to control localised floods and started work on four mini pumping stations at Mahalaxmi, P D’Mello Road, Wadala and Chunabhatti. There are two such stations at Gandhi Market and Hindmata which have been operational since last monsoon.

The city currently has six big pumping stations at Lovegrove, Cleveland Bunder, Haji Ali, Irla, Britannia and Gazdarband to pump out excess water from big nullahs into the sea in case of heavy rain and high tide. As several areas continue to witness localised flooding and several clearances are required to set up the big pumping stations in coastal regions, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation decided to set up the mini pumping stations.

“The basic idea is to pump out accumulated flood water from low lying areas to stormwater drains. The rainwater at low lying areas cannot flow up to the drain due to gravitational force. So pumps will ensure the floodwater is removed quickly,” said Prakash Sawardekar, deputy chief engineer of SWD department. The plan is based on the rainwater drainage system of the area, capacity of water pumping, incidents of heavy rain, water level during high and low tide and BRIMSTOWAD report.

The flood spot at Chunabhatti triggers massive traffic snarls on the Eastern Express Highway, so the BMC plans to drain out the rain water to Rahul Nagar nullah by constructing a culvert and a chamber at a low lying spot. In addition, one pump with the capacity of 1,000 cubic metres of water per hour, three pumps with the capacity of 3,000 litres per hour and two pumps capable of displacing 500 cubic metres of water per hour will be deployed.

Similarly, the BMC will arrange eight high capacity pumps of 3,000 litres per hour near Mahalaxmi Railway tracks to drain out water from Byculla East. “Work order has been given and we are trying to complete as much work as possible before the coming monsoon. But it is unlikely that the stations will be fully operational before the coming monsoon,” said Sawardekar.

BMC has identified 386 flooding spots across the city and various works have been completed to tackle 265 of these. Remedial works to tackle 53 flooding spots are expected to be completed before the onset of monsoon, while that of 11 will be tackled after the monsoon. The works required for 14 spots are in the planning stage while the remaining 43 spots are in government or private properties. Contractors have been finalised to arrange 380 temporary pumps to tackle these flooding spots at the ward level at a cost of R92.70 crore for the four months of monsoon.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

UNDERGROUND WATER PUMPS

Talking to India Today TV, Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said that the BMC has put high capacity pumps to tackle the flooding issue in the area. “Whenever the water collects in the area it is drained out with the help of these high pressure pumps and a long pipe which has been fixed underneath. We have fixed four such pumps and, depending on the rain, the water is pumped out. Also, there is a flood gate that has been made at the end where the water is released, which ensures that water during high tide instead of coming in is drained out,"" said Velrasu.

Unlike the Hindmata, another flood prone area where the BMC has installed water tanks, the Gandhi market doesn’t provide a buffer and hence the water has to be released immediately.

The BMC officer said that the civic body was committed to the welfare of the people and was deploying various systems in flood-prone areas depending on the ground conditions.

“We are continuously striving to get better with time. Today, with the installation of pumps, flood water does not gush inside shops and nearby areas even if it rains, so our main objective is complete,"" said Velrasu.

RESIDENTS LAUD MOVE

A shopkeeper in the area said that he clapped for the BMC because he saw the change after a long time. “I have my shop in the area and I stay in the nearby building. For the last forty-five years we have been facing problems. Today, after so long, when I am seeing some good change, I want to appreciate the BMC,"" he said.

Another shopkeeper said that the BMC has done sincere work. “For the last couple of days, we never had to close our shop even though it has been raining heavily.

After spending crores on tackling the problem of flooding in the city every single monsoon, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is thinking of trying yet another experiment: it wants to construct holding ponds under footpaths.

BMC has already started construction of holding ponds in a couple of chronic flooding spots in the city like the Hindmata and Milan subways. Holding ponds collect rainwater that drains off these spots.

“We are thinking of constructing holding ponds under footpaths. This idea is still at the discussion level. Mumbai has wide footpaths at many places. If there is a flooding spot in such a place then we could construct a holding pond under such footpaths,” said Additional Municipal Commissioner P.Velrasu.

According to data, BMC has tackled 73 per cent flooding spots in the city. It has identified 386 flooding spots and has already completed preventive work at 282 spots and at 30 places, the work is in the final stages,” said a BMC official.

Ever since the major deluge in the city in 2005, BMC has been conducting new experiments every year to ensure there is no repeat. But the problem of waterlogging has not yet been fully tackled,” said Sanjay Gurav, a civic activist. “Every year the city sees new waterlogging spots and then the BMC conducts a new experiment. The plan to prevent waterlogging should include the entire city at the same time. Every year we hear that the city will get relief from waterlogging. This is just like a pipedream for us,” Gurav added.

“Rainwater cannot be drained in case the heavy rain coincides with the high tide but it can be stored in holding ponds. This water can be released in nullahs when the rain stops and the tide recedes,” said a BMC official.

BMC’s experiments

. After the deluge of July 26, 2005, BMC undertook a Brihanmumbai stormwater disposal programme. Under this, BMC started widening and deepening of nullahs and rivers. Also, it constructed six mega pumping stations.BMC spent approximately Rs 4000 crore on this.

. When the problem of waterlogging did not end, the BMC started construction of mini pumping stations. After a successful experiment at Bandra which cost Rs 2 crore, BMC started construction on another one at Gandhi Market, King’s Circle, which cost Rs 21.78 crore. At the moment, these mini pumping stations are being constructed at JK chemical nullah, in Sion and at Mahalaxmi and Wadala. At Yellow Gate, there are four places where construction work on mini pumping stations is in the final stage.

. BMC has started construction of holding ponds at St Xavier’s ground in Parel and at Pramod Mahajan Garden at Dadar to tackle waterlogging at Hindmata. The cost of this project is over Rs 130 crore. Also, BMC has constructed a holding pond at a cost of Rs 33 crore to tackle the Milan Subway flooding.

. BMC has also spent more than Rs 100 crore on the desilting of rivers and nullahs and arranged for dewatering pumps at a cost of Rs 100 crore.",solution,Mumbai Floods 2022,"Mumbai, India","July 26, 2005","August 1, 2005",Mumbai city,1000 mm,Rs 4000 crore,1000,"Major disruption to daily life, loss of property and livelihoods",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Here Are 5 Factors Behind Monsoon Misery,"Beyond the Instagram stories that romanticise the weather, for many parts of Mumbai, rain spells deep trouble — quite literally — as waterlogging disrupts life and sometimes even leads to horror stories of death and destruction.

But what is it about Mumbai that it cannot handle the rain without getting choked almost every year during the monsoon season? Here are five of the main factors that play a part:

Topography — What It Stands On

The coastal city has several low-lying areas and some quite high. Parts of the city were built on land reclaimed in between seven islands, so there are saucer-shaped areas.

That means water — particularly when there's heavy rain — flow downs into these areas naturally. It drains out too, but only after it stops raining. These areas include Sion, Andheri Subway, Milan Subway, Khar Subway, which remain waterlogged for a couple of hours after heavy rain.

As rain hit the city and its suburbs Monday night, Sion and Andheri were already flooded. This, even as there was high alert for even more rain.

Tides — Ups And Downs Of The Sea

Mumbai's storm water drainage system empties out into the sea. During high tide — when the sea level rises — the drains are blockaded by gates to prevent the sea water from gushing back into the city's drainage system.

Worse, high tide coupled with heavy rain means the drainage has to be carried out using pumps. The drainage system starts working again once the tide subsides. But that can take up to six hours.

Percolation — Water Into The Ground

In most cities across the world, at least half the water percolates into the ground. In Mumbai, 90 per cent of the storm water is drained out through dedicated drains. That puts added pressure on the drainage system.

Weather Patterns — Heavy And Unusual

Drainage systems are built for an evenly spread-out monsoon. But, in recent years, Mumbai has seen some very heavy rain followed by dry spells, and then very heavy rain again.

On the days of unusually heavy rainfall, even the drains with increased capacity can't really keep up.

Encroachment — Blocked By People

Mumbai has seen massive encroachment along the major drains, making clearing of solid waste and silt a challenging task. In spite of pre-monsoon cleaning of drains, often in the monsoon, drains are clogged.

This means more waterlogging than would've occurred naturally.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Yet, Prema Sannake knows she can never be too prepared. “I feel like running away from this place at the thought of rains,” she says. The monsoons are merely half a month away and the 54-year-old homemaker is anxious.

For all the romance and chai-pakoda memories that the rains evoke, Mumbai’s monsoons end up stalling life in the metropolis — flooding streets and train tracks, bringing down trees and leaving office-goers stranded. Almost every year, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the civic body whose job is to get the city ready for the rains, finds itself scrambling to clean the drains and desilt the pipelines. This year is unlikely to be any different.

Sannake and husband Dhondiram, who retired from BSNL in 2006, live in a 180-square feet one-room flat at Hindmata junction, a chronic flooding spot in Mumbai’s Dadar area. “Every year for over three decades, I have spent days and nights in knee-deep stagnant water inside our room,” says Sannake.

She says she cannot remember a monsoon when the rains did not disrupt her life. Her two children — both in their late 20s — moved out in 2017 with their families to rented flats in a nearby locality, but that’s not an option for the Sannakes. “This is the house I came to as a bride. This is the only place in the city I know as my house,” says Sannake.

(Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty)

For almost all the years that she has lived here, Sannake has had to struggle with the rains. “Every year, politicians promise there will be no floods, but the problem only keeps getting worse. After the rains, it takes me nearly two days to scoop out the water and get the house back to normal. For four months every year, we sit in the water as it rains and when it stops, we throw out the water, bucket by bucket. I can’t even cook during those days as the kitchen counter is stacked with boxes and other things,” complains Sannake.

The two lofts in the room are a lifesaver. In the days leading up to the rains, Sannake starts moving grains, clothes, the microwave and wooden boxes into the loft. “We mount the refrigerator and washing machines onto a platform. But if the water rises beyond 2 feet, those get submerged. How many times can we get these repaired? I also put away all documents and keep the bottom shelf of the cupboard empty.”

Hindmata is a saucer-shaped, low-lying area in Mumbai’s central district between Dadar TT and Parel. Every year, floodwaters gush into people’s homes and shops, rising to about three to four feet and staying that way for hours at a stretch.

Over the last month, the Sannakes have spent over Rs 1 lakh to flood-proof their ground-floor room. Among the new additions is a granite slab at the threshold to stop the water from gushing in.

The dilapidated three-storey building has both families and small-scale commercial establishments. Out of the 15 rooms on the ground floor, only the Sannakes and three other families have stayed on. Others have either sold the properties over the years or rented them out to small-scale cloth godowns.

Urban experts say it’s not just the saucer-shaped topography that causes the annual flooding in Hindmata, and point to how the BMC is almost never prepared — while old sewer lines lie damaged, new illegal ones crisscross the area.

Old British-era arch drains — designed to carry rainwater from Dadar to Britannia (Reay Road) outfall and finally into the sea — have been reduced to barely 1.13 sqm from their original 2.69 sqm carrying capacity due to silting and encroachments, said a retired civic official.

In 2016, the BMC constructed the Britannia pumping station, claiming that it would make the Hindmata junction free of waterlogging. But the neighbourhood continued to get flooded. The following year, an inquiry into the functioning of the Britannia pumping station recommended the installation of additional drains to carry rainwater, following which, in 2019, Rs 50 crore was spent to lay the lines and augment the capacity of the existing lines.

But Hindmata remained a water-filled saucer during the rains.

Residents of the area are now pinning their hopes on an ambitious project — two new underground water tanks, at Dadar and St Xavier’s Grounds, that are coming up to temporarily store floodwater, which will be discharged into the sea through drains once the high tide recedes. The tanks, over a km from their building, are connected to Hindmata through a 1,600-mm-diameter stormwater drain line. But it’s already May and the work is far from complete.

One of the main reasons for Hindmata’s flooding is its geography, says the BMC. “The area is shaped like a saucer due to which all rainwater gets accumulated here from surrounding areas like Parel, Lalbaug and Dadar. To solve this problem, capacity of the underground tanks is being increased, so that they can hold more water,” said an official from the SWD (Storm Water Drains) department.

The BMC’s nearest pumping station from Hindmata — Britannia pumping station – is located at Reay Road, about 5 km away. Officials say that the farther away a chronic flooding spot is from a pumping station, the more time it takes for water to recede from the area.

On May 19, Mumbai Suburban Guardian Minister Aaditya Thackeray said after taking the stock of the city’s monsoon preparation, “We have created holding ponds in areas like Gandhi Market, Hindmata, and chronic flooding spots. These can hold water for a few hours and drain it. But still, if extreme weather event like cloud burst takes place, no one can do anything. The fury of nature can be stopped by none.”

But Sannake is running out of patience. “This year, if I have to bucket out water like I do every year, the pumps and tanks are a failure. I don’t want to know if the water receded in an hour or two this year. I don’t want a single drop of water in my room.”",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Waterlogging is one of life’s certainties if you live in the city of dreams. Every year, the civic body conjures a new solution to the problem, and each year, the monsoons laugh at it. This time, Wadala-based entrepreneur and engineer Ankur Puranik, may win the match.

The 41-year-old amateur weather analyst has designed Flood-O-Meter, an auto-activated waterlogging detection, measurement and reporting system. The portable device, 25 of which have already been installed in various spots such as Dadar’s Hindu Colony and Star Cinema in Mazagaon, can detect waterlogging and avoid resultant problems, including traffic snarls.

“It is a cylindrical device with a donut-shaped disk float, with a microcontroller attached to it,” Puranik explains. “It gets activated automatically as water accumulates. The disk floats up and down the cylinder as per the water level, the microcontroller reads the movement and sends data to the BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation].”

This is space technology compared to the crude manual methods used by authorities currently. “Water is currently being measured in terms such as knee-deep, waist-level or chest-level,” says Puranik. “Some places have measuring scales, but the reading is in feet; this device measures in inches, giving an accurate picture.”

During heavy rainfall, BMC needs dynamic information on water level—how efficiently it’s draining away or whether the level is increasing dangerously. Puranik’s device does this. The civic body has purchased the patented technology for Rs 2.32 crore, including 100 devices, the dashboard and a contract for three-year maintenance. It is now confident of issuing necessary warnings, say alerting a school to remain shut, divert traffic or close a road.

“This device will help map water-logging in the entire city,” says Puranik. “The dashboard receives data at an interval of 15 minutes. This includes the time water accumulation began, the current level, the speed at which it is rising or receding, and location. This information is also available in the form of graphs, which analyse the time of the highest level, areas that need intervention, etc. Another window gives them measurement of rainfall in millimetres at the crucial location.” Hope is that this data can also be used by disaster management teams, meteorologists and scientists to study the annual problem in depth.

This isn’t Puranik’s first device. He has designed an automated weather station for the Railways and he also claims to have created the first made-in-India oxygen concentrator during the COVID-19 pandemic. The idea for the latest device struck him during the pandemic and from the depths of his own struggles during the monsoon season. “The problem is we don’t know what the level of water is, and whether we should take our car out or back,” he says. “When I searched for solutions online, I couldn’t find much. That led me to conceive a device that measures water level.”

For a living, Puranik designs, develops and manufactures equipment for the defence, Indian Railways, police, disaster management and the BMC. “For the Defence and police departments, we have made a portable lighting solution for operations in dimly-lit areas or in regions without electricity,” he says.

He developed the latest device within a year and by June 2021, filed for a patent. Its highlight, he says, is that it self-activates when water begins pooling in an area, saving manpower—to manually activate it—and power during the rest of the year. “I have used PVC for the cylinder and not iron that would rust,” he says, “Stainless steel would raise cost and seed the fear of being stolen. PVC makes it portable and compact. The entire unit weighs around 10 kg, and has a self-contained battery that can power the system for 50 flooded days, which is more than enough. On an average, waterlogging lasts four to 10 days.”

Puranik says he has received enquiries from other states, but is currently focusing on Mumbai. The next step would be to reach out to the Railways, as they too struggle with trains and passengers getting stranded in the middle of nowhere. But will it have the last word?

Let’s verify the claim being made in the post.

Claim: Recent visuals of flooded streets near the Taj Hotel, Gateway to India. Fact: The video is not related to the 2022 rains. The same video was uploaded on YouTube in 2021. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.

After searching the internet with relevant keywords, we found a video on YouTube that shared similar visuals. The video’s title reads ‘Mumbai Rain, Gateway of India, Taj Hotel’, and it was uploaded to YouTube on 23 July 2021.

Further research also led us to another YouTube channel that posted the same video on 19 July 2021. Similar visuals of huge waves crashing on the Gateway of India are shared by multiple media outlets attributing them to Cyclone Tauktae. These reports can be seen here, here. All this indicates that the video is old and is not related to the recent rains and floods.

To sum it up, an old video is being shared as visuals of Taj hotel during the recent Mumbai rains.

Update (12 September 2022):

Another video is also being shared attributing it to visuals near the Taj Mahal Hotel and Gateway of India during Mumbai rains in 2022.

Mumbai : Amid heavy rainfall witnessed in the city early on Tuesday, Mumbai’s two major subways in the western suburbs showed different results in terms of water accumulation. While Milan Subway, which is a chronic waterlogging spot, saw no waterlogging, Andheri Subway had to be closed to traffic due to flooding.

Both the subways, which connect east and west of the railway tracks, are below sea level and get inundated every year.

Earlier this year, the Milan Subway failed during the first heavy spell of monsoon in July, however, after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) installed a pumping station for the holding pond the subway has been able to tackle the situation. But the situation did not improve at the Andheri subway.

In an effort to tackle the waterlogging menace, the BMC dug up a holding pond with a capacity of two crore litres at the Milan subway. The pond was supposed to hold the water accumulated in the subway during heavy downpours when the drains are at their maximum capacity. After the rain subsides, this water is then released back into the drain.

However, this move did not work out in July. The civic corporation has now installed a pumping system that aided in keeping the subway waterlogging-free even as the surrounding areas received around 100 mm of rain between 2 am and 6 am yesterday.

Meanwhile, the Andheri Subway was flooded and closed for traffic as the accumulated water reached over two feet on Tuesday morning. The Mumbai traffic police had alerted citizens of the same via a post on their official Twitter handle.

BMC has installed six water pumps in the area and the subway was cleared once the rain stopped after 7 am.

The civic body has floated tenders worth Rs 100 crore to expand the capacity of drains to resolve the issue of the Andheri Subway. This work is likely to take another two years to get completed.",flood,Mumbai Subway Flood,"Mumbai, India",2022-07-19,2022-07-19,['Andheri Subway'],['100 mm'],['$100 crore'],['0'],['Traffic disruption'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

“Compared to last year, the Central Railway had more water pumps across 19 flood-prone locations. We have removed almost 1.75 lakh cubic metres of muck along both the main and harbour line. Installation of flood gates at Masjid, Byculla, Matunga and Sion-Kurla areas and deploying staff for crowd control at the critical foot over bridge also helped,” said an officer from Central Railway.

A culvert augmentation at Masjid through micro tunnelling also helped keep the tracks from flooding. Moreover, the Western Railway also conducted a drone survey of 23 locations for monitoring, cleaning and identification of choke points in culverts and nullahs. Compared to last year a 14% rise in the number of pumps provided on the tracks and depots including sewerage and submersible pumps. “We also checked all the rakes and conducted the necessary monsoon precautions for its smooth functioning,” said an officer from the Western railway.

Meanwhile, the passenger associations claim that while there were hardly any instances of waterlogging, the monsoon also has not taken its full form yet. “This year the rains also have not poured continuously, it has taken a break and allowed the water to recede, this can also be one of the reasons for the flooding to not occur on tracks,” said Shashikumar Nair, chairman of Yatra Samiti.",solution,Mumbai Floods 2023,"Mumbai, India","June 10, 2023","June 15, 2023","['Mumbai City', 'Mumbai Suburban', 'Thane', 'Raigad']","['100 mm, 150 mm, 200 mm']","['$100 million', '$200 million', '$300 million']","['10, 20, 30']","['Thousands of people displaced', 'Damage to infrastructure', 'Businesses closed']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

To measure waterlogging levels across the city, the BMC has started installing flood gauges with sensors at 100 locations at Rs 2.32 crore price tag. In the first phase, the instrument has been installed at 25 flooding spots. These sophisticated gauges will send alerts to the civic body's storm water drain (SWD) as well as the disaster management cell from next week.

The installation of flood gauges at 75 spots is underway. It would help the civic authorities to plan and tackle flooding in the specific area more effectively, said the civic officials.

The BMC has identified 386 flooding spots across the city and various works have been completed to tackle 312 spots. The work required for eight spots is in the planning stage, while the work on 33 spots will be tackled till the next monsoon.

Currently, to tackle waterlogging, 487 dewatering pumps have been installed across the city, water holding tanks are constructed at Hindmata and Milan Subway while the capacity of the storm water drain has been increased. However, there is no mechanism to understand the level of floods in the city.

“Internet-based auto-activated rain waterlogging level detectors with a remote reading capability system (flood gauge) will provide us data on the level of waterlogging in the area, the time taken for the water to recede, and the amount of rainfall in that particular area with time. According to that data, we will study the reason for waterlogging and try to find a permanent solution,” said the official from the SWD department.

Once rainwater gets accumulated in that particular area, the flood gauges installed there will send alerts after every 15 minutes to the officials concerned on their mobile phones. Also, the BMC dashboard will be updated in real-time. “We had plans to install this instrument at 300 locations but currently we will be installing flood gauges at 100 locations by September end. The estimated cost of the project is around Rs 2.32 crore and an Indian company is appointed to install and maintain it for three years,” the official added.

Had she decided to deliver her baby in Mumbai, she would have to navigate the waist-high tidal waters that flooded the area around her home twice every day. A single room built of wood and sheets of scrap metal in a slum, her home stands on uneven wooden and bamboo poles driven into the soft soil where land meets the sea.

Among an estimated 6,000 homes built on the coastal fringe of Cuffe Parade, from Ambedkar Nagar to Ganesh Nagar and Murti Nagar, Chandni’s tarpaulin roof has been whipped off by monsoon gusts on several occasions, drenching the family of five and their meagre stock of foodgrain. “We crowd into somebody else’s home until it’s fixed,” she says. “The rains have been so harsh in recent years, every monsoon somebody’s house is destroyed completely. Nobody is spared.”

Her husband suffered a paralytic stroke after an unexplained fever, and no longer works. She herself has suffered from a persistent cough, but there is neither money for a doctor nor time to recuperate. “I’m just exhausted all the time,” says the mother of three.

Impact of climate change on housing in Mumbai’s slums

For the six million Mumbaikars who live in informal housing, climate conditions have steadily worsened over the past decade. Flooding of homes in slum clusters is more frequent, with every flooding episode causing more damage to property.

A 2015 report commissioned by the World Bank Group found that a significantly large proportion of poor households were located near areas with chronic flooding, rendering them at severe risk from rising sea levels and storm surges. According to the latest Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) report, global warming is expected to exceed the 1.5°C benchmark, exposing cities to floods, extreme heat, storm surges and cyclones. Some of these have already begun to occur.

Livelihoods in Mumbai slums at stake

Across Chandni’s home, also on stilts, lives Serafoon Bibi. “You could suffer the heat and the storms if work was good, but we are no longer able to earn enough money,” she says. The Bengali families in this garbage-strewn patch of Ambedkar Nagar work at Sassoon Docks, twisting the heads off fish that are sent for processing as sliced steaks or fillets. The pay is Rs 2 for a kilo of de-headed fish.

According to Serafoon, who migrated from Murshidabad only three years ago, the catch is much less now than when she first arrived. “We used to earn Rs 400-Rs 500 a day,” she says, “and now sometimes we don’t even make Rs 50. Maal hi nahi hai. (There’s no catch.)”

Serafoon describes a vicious cycle succinctly: As landless poor, they came to Mumbai because agricultural wages in her home district were very low, her husband suffered an arm injury and financial losses when he tried to work as a mason in Saudi Arabia, but in Mumbai the losses continue to mount as the catch of fish shrinks. Meanwhile they deplete their small savings every time the house is damaged during the monsoon or every time one of the three children falls sick with flood-related diseases such as diarrhoea or typhoid fever.

Sharifa and Serafoon Bibi’s home is made up of tin sheets for walls and a roof of bits of scrap metal, bamboo poles, tarpaulin and plastic tied down together. The rent is Rs 2,500 per month, and an additional Rs 400 for electricity, both paid to a local man. The roof is flimsy and sustains damages every monsoon, while the tin walls make the room insufferably hot in the summer. Pic: Kavitha Iyer

Worsening health and climate change

This year, hospitals reported a spike in heat-related ailments such as exhaustion, heat-stroke, nausea, headaches during a heatwave-like period in March 2022 – an unprecedented climate incident in the financial capital.

Prakash Chavan’s Rainbow Foundation conducted several grocery and food distribution drives in Ambedkar Nagar during the pandemic. He said the houses on the edge of the sea tend to belong to those without ration cards, very poor families without access to India’s food security programme, many suffering from routine nutritional deficiencies. Serafoon, Chandni and several others in Ambedkar Nagar said they have never tried to get state-funded medical insurance.

Shweta Damle, founder of Habitat And Livelihood Welfare Association (HALWA), says hot days have increased, as have rainy days, leading to increased vulnerability to climate-related health concerns — mainly respiratory diseases from aerosols in the air and skin problems due to extreme heat combined with poor hygiene practices caused by poor availability of sanitation.

“Especially in dense slums, all the children have boils in the summer months, much more frequently than earlier,” says Damle, who has worked for over two decades on slum-dwellers’ issues in Mumbai. “Sore eyes, breathing problems caused by poor ventilation and aerosols, these are rising.”

According to the World Health Organization, extreme heat exposure may cause heat exhaustion and heat strokes, a condition which causes faintness, as well as dry, warm skin as the body fails to regulate its temperatures. Other symptoms include swelling in the lower limbs, heat rash on the neck, cramps, headache, irritability, lethargy and weakness. “Acute cerebrovascular accidents” may result from heat-waves too, the WHO says. Additionally, people with chronic diseases who take daily medications have a greater risk of complications, and death during a heatwave, so do older people and children.

Climate change adds to expenses

As the number of days of heat rain rises, people are forced to make greater investment in proper roofing, protection of their belongings, etc, as well as on medical expenditure and on replacing lost assets.

The cost is higher in the summers, making health and hygiene more challenging for the family. Chandni has to carry the cans home from a distance of about 800 metres, and then hoist them up the steep stepladder into the house. Pic: Kavitha Iyer

“Hardships for the urban poor have increased on account of climate,” she says. “And they will face more difficult times in coming years through loss of wages when they’re unable to go to work on very hot days or when low-lying areas get flooded.”

A short walk from HALWA’s office in a Bandra Reclamation slum, autorickshaw driver Aslam Shaikh lives in a shanty made of tin sheets. The house is like a sauna in the summer. “More and more, we’re sweating inside, and breathless,” says Tehmida, his wife. “Earlier we used to drench gunny bags in water and put them on the roof for cooling, but now it’s dangerous with all the electric cables criss-crossing overhead.”

Bleak times ahead

Multiple reports have said the urban poor will be the most vulnerable to climate change impact in cities such as Mumbai. However, official mitigation plans do not include any outreach work in the slums to educate residents on how to tackle the coming change, says Damle.

The Shaikhs spend long parts of summer days outdoors in the bylanes of the slum or on the roadside. “In the rains we can’t even do that,” says Aslam, adding that the monsoon has become, in recent years, an annual trail of expenditure. “Even when secured with rope, the plastic and tarpaulin sheets on the roof fly off in the wind, sometimes the entire roof is uprooted. The kids fall sick, sometimes everything is wet for a week to ten days.”

On a particularly rainy day in 2020, the Shaikhs’ neighbour went to pick up their children from school. When they got back, they found that the entire mezzanine floor had collapsed. It took more than a year for them to save up money to rebuild parts of it.

An exhausted Serafoon says she allows her daughter Sharifa to accompany her to the docks while she’s working. “She gives me a helping hand,” says the mother.

The 11-year-old girl who studies in the Urdu medium section of a municipal school says she helps remove the head or the belly flap of fish. Pointing to a tiny scratch near the cuticle of her left thumb, she says the fish scales are sometimes rough, and she has to walk a long distance to the designated spot where the heads are discarded. On very hot days, she gets home exhausted. “My feet hurt, my fingers burn,” she says. “But the next day we go back anyway.”

She is a contributor to several magazines. LESS ... MORE

A study published in Geophysical Research Letters journal of March, by climate researchers at IIT Bombay has revealed the coastal city of Mumbai is sinking into the sea at the rate of 2 mm per year. Well, apparently it may appear to be a small thing but a huge amount of capital investment will be called for in case we let the disaster unfold. Mumbai’s urban population in 2022 is estimated to be over 22 million which is expected to increase to close to 30 million by 2050. This highlights the risk on the level of human capital in India. Furthermore, Mumbai currently contributes 6.16% of the total GDP of India.

RMSI (a global risk management firm) has revealed that Haji Ali Dargah Jawahar Lal Nehru Port Trust, Western Express Highway, Bandra-Worli Sea-link, and Queen’s Necklace on Marine drive are key infrastructures in Mumbai that are at risk of submergence. Their experts have used Digital Terrain Model along with a coastal flood model to map the cities’ inundation levels based on various sea-level rise forecasts. As per their calculations, around 998 buildings and 24 km of road length will be affected by potential sea-level rise by 2050 in Mumbai, and around 2,490 buildings and a road length of 126 km will be affected by a potential sea-level rise during the high tide in the city. Damages from rising sea levels in Mumbai are estimated to reach Rs 4,900 to Rs 5,000 crore by 2050, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report released in March 2022. Furthermore, the United Nations report stated that the resulting damage in the financial capital of India might even go up Rs 12,082 crore annually by 2050 if this trend continues.

The IPCC recently released the second part of its sixth assessment report, which focused on the impact of cyclones. “It is going to be much more pronounced in the future for Mumbai, both pre and post monsoon cyclones will increase. India has a 7,500 km coast line, affecting megacities like Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. So, the impacts of sea level rise, storm surges, cyclones and rising sea surface temperatures are all high-risk factors for these cities and adaptation is the primary solution,” said climate scientist Anjal Prakash, also one of the co-authors of the report.

IPCC further estimated that Mumbai will be among the 20 largest coastal cities in the world with highest flood losses by 2050. “A very high urban population is exposed to increased flood risk in megacities and this includes Mumbai. Here, homes of economically weak families required various repairs to protect them against flood damage, and the total cost of those repairs consumed a larger proportion of their income than for wealthier ones,” the report stated.

As we know, Covid-19 took us all by surprise. We were not prepared to deal with the pandemic nor did we have a system in place to forecast and prepare for the future. We failed on many fronts, infrastructure just being one of them. Well, we can see the similar ignorance being played out in the case of sinking Mumbai.

Mumbai is the economic hub of India, contributing 10% of factory employment, 25% of industrial output, 33% of income tax collections, 60% of customs duty collections, the economic powerhouse of India not only contributes the highest GDP of $209 billion but is also responsible for 25% of industrial output, 70% of maritime trade and 70% of capital transactions to the nation’s economy. Mumbai’s contribution is 6.16% of the total GDP of India. Will it not make sense that we approach the flooding crisis of Mumbai on an urgent basis? In just 25-30 years as we reach 2050 which is not too far, we will see the crisis unfold in an uncontrollable way. Deploying large capital investments later to recover from the damage will ultimately put India’s growth on a declining road.

Mumbai receives an average of about 95 inches of rain annually, mainly during the four-month rainy season. Immense urbanization has led to choking of waterways including the Mithi river the lifeline for water release hindering drainage especially during monsoon. Mumbai’s stormwater drainage system including network of surface drains, underground drains and canals are outdated and fail to meet the current and future requirements. Floods are bound to happen affecting the city. Mangroves on Mumbai’s coastline a vital component in absorbing water and mitigating the impact of torrential rain and rising sea levels have vanished to a great extent. What we now need is to protect whatever mangroves plantation are left. For removal of flood waters, a clean river that’s connected to a functional drainage is necessary. Mumbai needs to strengthen both green and blue infrastructure.

According to a World Bank study in 2015, “half of the poor did not consider moving out of flood-prone areas fearing the insecurity of living in a new place which would result in the form of severe social disruptions, reduced access to education as well as health facilities”.

More construction activities will make the overall foundation of the Mumbai city weak. The stakes are huge, but prevention measures are merely on papers than in actions. Mumbai is a part of the C40 Cities network, a group of nearly 100 major cities globally working to drive faster action on climate change. Along with its pledge to be net-zero by 2050. The question is how long we will wait to open our eyes to see this approaching disaster.

Mumbai home to major financial institutions, banks and stock exchanges, plays a vital role in bringing the stakeholders together. Business dynamics will drastically change and such change will not be in favour of India. India can lose its holdings not just in the global markets, but the entire nation will pay the huge cost if we ignore the potential of Mumbai’s downfall. BAU (business-as-usual) water management practices will not be able to control the massive upheaval that plays out if this crisis is not sufficiently attended to with immediate basis.

Political and corporate leaders along with policymakers and regulators must coordinate to build and follow the right policy and regulatory mechanisms integrating the estimated climate change driven water and heat risks to address this approaching crisis. Mumbai can provide new economic opportunities only if it builds resilient systems that are equipped to handle such flood waters. If Mumbai pulls this off, India will be able to achieve a powerful place in the global economy.

BHPian roadheat recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

Hello,

I am from Bombay & have recently purchased the Kia Sonet iMT Petrol. However, this will be my first monsoon with the iMT.

Familiar with the flooding that happens in Mumbai, we all have waded through the floods in our manual transmission cars (always keeping the clutch down & accelerating while idle, to prevent water from getting into the engine).

How do you do this in an iMT? Is it possible to drive an iMT through floods? You do not have a clutch pedal, so do you just accelerate in neutral when you are idling?

iMT owners please suggest if you have experienced driving an iMT in floods before.

Thanks

Here's what BHPian windrider had to say about the matter:

This is where a lot of people mistakenly believe that water entering through the exhaust pipe is what causes the engine to stall. 9 times out of 10, it is the water that enters through the vehicle's air intake that makes its way into the engine and leads to engine hydrolock. Most cars have their air intake placed just behind the grill or the space behind one of the headlights. Some have it placed even lower behind the bumper. It doesn't matter if your car is an automatic or a manual, if water gets into your air box, it's game over. Anyway, if you are forced to drive through a flooded street, I guess you will have to plan a few metres in advance in what gear you need to be in. Apart from that, the only other way I see is, as you said, put it in neutral and rev the engine. Attaching a video by Scotty Kilmer. I was shocked by just how a few inches of water that might seem safe can total your car.

Here's what BHPian dhanushs had to say about the matter:

The reason why they say to accelerate is to keep the exhaust pressure higher than the water pressure so that the exhaust isn't choked and the vehicle shuts off. The bigger concern would be water entering through the intake. An even bigger concern would be the reliability of your electrical components after water wading. I would strongly suggest that even though you have a high GC vehicle, AVOID water whenever possible. It's not possible to gauge the depth of the water, or the splash, or the bow wave in traffic, so, if a car finds it difficult, then you should treat the Kia Sonet similarly. If you really need to pass through, then possibly wait for the traffic to calm down, then drive at a constant rpm/speed in a lower gear keeping the rpms high, and speed low, so that minor bumps or potholes shouldn't make a difference.

“The stations and tunnels are made in such a way that the only way rainwater could enter the premises is through the entry and exit points. We have removable planks that can be placed to restrict water from entering the premises. Moreover, during floods, the number of people on the roads will be fewer so the floodgates will not restrict movement. All station buildings are constructed at a height to avoid flood water from entering the premises,” said a senior officer from the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC).

Till now, over 1000 km of trial runs of the metro from Aarey to Marol Naka have been completed, and MMRC plans to end the runs by February. “The trial runs are currently conducted at a speed of 65 km an hour. The speed will be further augmented to a maximum of 95 km per hour during the oscillation trials. The latter will be followed by integration and signalling trials and finally service trials,” said an officer from MMRC.

The design-proving trial run is being held from August 30 onwards with one rake on one track on the three-kilometre stretch between Aarey and Marol Naka stations. The first prototype rake will run to and fro on this track at night on a regular basis. After the crossover track is removed, the trial run will extend till Sahar.

The existing prototype train will be shifted to the down line and a new set of coaches will come from Sri City in Andhra Pradesh for testing and trials. The entire trial encompasses a 10,000 km-run.

“A multimodal integration at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus will be done with the Metro Line 3. This will help commuters from Central Railway to access Metro Line 3 through an underpass,” said an officer from MMRC.

Till now, the overall project progress is 76.6 percent. Tunnelling work is 99.6 percent complete while the track work is 45 percent complete. The metro will be the first to have platforms that are enclosed—the doors will open only after a train enters a platform and the train doors slide open for passengers. This system will avoid the trespassing on tracks that is so common on Mumbai’s railways.

Background

The Metro 3 line is called Aqua line. Its prototype coaches are 3,200 mm wide and each can accommodate approximately 2,400 passengers. This line of the metro portrays marine culture and the importance that the sea has for Mumbai.

The 33.5-km-long Colaba-Bandra-Seepz Metro 3 project is the first underground corridor of the metro network coming up in the city. Of the 27 stations on this line, 26 will be underground. This metro line is funded by a loan from the Japan International Cooperation Agency.

The villagers have long been demanding a rehabilitation package on par with the NMIA PAPs. The villages are located around 100m away from the site and hence CIDCO has rejected claims for rehabilitation.

Several protests have been held over the years and the villagers have also threatened to stop the airport work.

Pramod Naik, 40, a resident of the village, said, “Our village is flooded despite barely 2-3 days of rain. Last year, the village drowned. This year, too, we are headed towards the same situation if the rains continue to lash the region.”

The residents claimed that CIDCO had assured to take measures closer to the monsoon, however none of them worked.

Naik said, “This year, they decided to increase the capacity of the holding pond saying it will help accumulate more water and prevent flooding of the region. We opposed it. However, they went ahead with it. That too has not helped the situation. Instead, they should rehabilitate us from the village.”

Machinder Mali, 35, another resident, added, “We never had floods in our area except in 2005. However, ever since the land filling at the airport site started, there has been no respite from floods. We suffer heavy losses every year as water enters our homes and our electronic and other household items are destroyed. Our fields are also destroyed because of the flooding every year.”

CIDCO did not give any statement when contacted. An official requesting anonymity claimed, “We have taken all the necessary pre-monsoon work in the region.

Municipal Commissioner I S Chahal said they have made a temporary arrangement for shifting people from Bharat Nagar in buildings constructed for project-affected people in Mahul as there is a risk of further landslides. “We have identified about 250 people who are in the danger zone. The BMC will move them from a safety point of view. As per the set SOP, the BMC has warned residents about landslides before monsoon,” BMC commissioner I S Chahal told The Indian Express.

He said, “As per the procedure, we will conduct a detailed investigation to find out what has triggered the landslide and wall collapses.”

Meanwhile, in western part of the city, areas like Kandivali, Borivali and Dahisar, witnessed flooding which caused property damages in many chawls and buildings. In Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the forest department’s office and residential quarters of forest officers were damaged due to flooding of Dahisar River.

Heavy rainfall, described by meteorologists as “monstrous”, hammered down on India’s financial capital over the weekend causing mass devastation. In the eastern suburb of Chembur, the collapse of a wall in the night led to a landslide that enveloped homes as people were sleeping and killed at least 21, according to the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).

At least 10 people were also killed in the suburb of Vikhroli in the city’s north-east, when a landslide hit several homes, and three others in the city were killed in separate incidents.

The rain also inundated a water purification plant, leaving part of the city without drinking water. Mumbai residents were advised to boil water from the tap before consuming it.

With heavy rainfall predicted for the next five days, the city is bracing itself for further casualties.

The coastal city of Mumbai is always badly hit by the monsoon, and suffers flooding every year but it is feared that the changing patterns of the rains due to climate change will lead to even more extreme flooding and damage. In recent years, the monsoon has shifted towards long dry spells broken up by burst of extreme rainfall, which are more likely to flood drains and overwhelm infrastructure in the over-populated city.

The thunderstorm that caused the intense rainfall was described as “uncommon” for this time of year. On Sunday morning, some areas of Mumbai experienced over 20cm of rainfall in the space of just a few hours.

State environment minister Aadtiya Thackeray said: “We have been talking about climate change and it is happening.”

Current monsoon modelling systems also struggle to forecast such heavy downpours, meaning it is harder to give people prior warning of potential flooding or landslides. On Sunday, it was only at 1am that a warning was put out about extreme rains.

Prime minister Narendra Modi tweeted his condolences to victims, and offered compensation to the families of those who had died in the landslides.

Of the package, ₹1,500 crore will be allocated towards ex-gratia for the flood-affected people, ₹3,000 crore for redevelopment and ₹7,000 crore for various long-term flood-mitigation schemes.

The state cabinet in a meeting on Tuesday gave its nod to the proposal.

The state cabinet also increased the compensation to the affected people by setting the set norms of the SDRF aside. The ex-gratia for the complete damage to houses has been increased to ₹1.5 lakh from ₹96,000, while the compensation for the partial damage to houses has been hiked and ranges between ₹15,000 and ₹50,000. The next to the kin of the deceased will be given ₹9 lakh as ex gratia. The traders and road-side venders will be given ex-gratia of ₹50,000 and ₹10,000 each as compensation for their losses.

Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said the package may increase as the assessment of the flood-affected districts is yet to be completed. “The completion of the assessment is 80% to 90% and we expect them to be completed in the next few days. The relief package includes the compensation for the losses to the people, road and electricity infrastructure and public and private properties. A total of 200,000 families have been affected, while 16,000 traders of all sizes have sustained. We have disbursed ex-gratia of ₹10,000 as immediate help to about 800 families,” he said.

Wadettiwar said that the next to the kin of the deceased in the flooding will get ₹9 lakh. Besides the ex-gratia of ₹4 lakh as per NDRF norms, an additional Rs1 lakh from the CM relief fund, ₹2 lakh from the PM relief fund and ₹2 lakh from the farmer insurance scheme to the families of the deceased. The road and bridges has sustained losses of ₹2,400 crore, while the losses to the electricity infrastructure is more than ₹1,200 crore. More than 30,000 hectares of the agricultural land has eroded.

Minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said the state government is chalking out a policy for the rehabilitation of the villages vulnerable to the landslide and rain-related calamities. The villages and hamlets that the prone to the calamities like landslides will be rehabilitated as per the policy, which will be approved by the cabinet. The district authorities are identifying such vulnerable settlements. The Taliye village, which was devastated in the landslide two weeks ago, and four hamlets adjacent to it will be rehabilitated by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada). The place has been identified by the local authorities. The rehabilitation with the laying of the infrastructure will require ₹4.5 lakh per house, of which ₹1.5 lakh will be given by the state, while remaining cost will be borne by Mhada,” he said.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has also directed the state authorities to constitute a committee of administrative officers and experts to recommend the plan for the rehabilitation of people living in blue line of the rivers and landslide-prone areas. “Also, undertake the widening and deepening of the rivers such as Gandhari, Savitri, Vashishti from Konkan, along with constructing flood-control wall on these rivers in next three years. The Real Time Data Acquisition system, too, should be set up on these rivers in the next three months,” he has directed the authorities.

According to the officials from the chief minister office, the expert committee will recommend the steps to be taken for the flood management, conservation of the eco sensitive zones and rehabilitation of the people from the vulnerable areas.

Heavy rainfall for more than a week from July 22 had lashed Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg in Konkan, Sangli, Kolhapur, Satara in western Maharashtra and parts of Vidarbha and central Maharashtra. More than 11 landslides in Raigad, Satara and Ratnagiri claimed 219 lives, injuring 52 people. Six people are still missing.

Thackeray had visited flood- hit western Maharashtra and Konkan over the past ten days and assured flood-affected people of a relief package. He also hinted at strict action against the encroachments and illegal structures in the floodplains and riverbanks. He had also said that the state government will study the reports submitted by the experts groups in the past and take corrective actions accordingly.

In western Maharashtra, 132,635 families are affected in Pune, Sangli, Satara and Kolhapur. 8,034 domestic structures were damaged fully or partially, while 5,428 traders suffered losses in four districts. In eight districts of central Maharasthra, 115,663 hectares under crops in 1,003 villages has been damaged since June 1.

“The package covers more than 15 districts across the state and the losses sustained from June 1,the beginning of the monsoon, has been taken into consideration, while announcing it,” said an official from the relief and rehabilitation department.

Speaking to reporters after a review meeting at Chiplun in Raigad district, Thackeray said: “The government will do everything to make them (those affected) stand on their feet. The assistance such as food, clothes, medicines and others will be provided to flood-affected people immediately. The district administration has been instructed that technical issues should not come in the way of providing assistance.”

Union Minister Narayan Rane, however, expressed concern over what he alleged was the “lackadaisical approach” of the state government. “Where is the state government? Where are the state and district officials? People are helpless. But there is no help from the state administration,” Rane said after a visit to Taliye village in Raigad, where 49 people were killed in landslides.

Rane’s visit came a day after Thackeray had visited the village. On Sunday, the Chief Minister reached Chiplun in Ratnagiri, where he interacted with traders who stopped his convoy and later held a meeting with the district administration.

According to the state government’s control room, Raigad has recorded the highest death toll with 60 so far followed by 41 in Satara. While 100 people are still reported missing, 50 others sustained injuries on Sunday evening.

The government said that rescue teams have evacuated 2,29,074 people so far with the highest number of 1,69,968 rescued from Sangli followed by 40,882 from Kolhapur. At present, it said, 25 rescue teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), four of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), five of the Navy, three of the Army and two of the Coast Guard are engaged in rescue operations in the state.

Besides, 3,248 animal deaths have been reported so far in the affected districts and 17,300 poultry deaths in Sangli district alone.

The Chief Minister said he would announce a relief package after conducting a complete review of the flood-affected districts. “I will not announce a relief package for the sake of popularity or to make someone feel better. I will visit areas in western Maharashtra tomorrow to review the damage. A complete review of all districts, such as Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur, will be taken in the next few days and the relief package will be announced,” he said.

Thackeray said his government will put in place a flood control system to tackle such incidents better. “Considering the repeated incidents of such natural disasters, a system on the lines of the NDRF will be created in all these districts. So that they can carry out relief and rescue operations before the NRDF or other agencies reach for assistance. Also, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) will be strengthened,” he said.

He said the Centre is providing assistance to the state and has assured all possible help. “After completion of the review, the government will seek assistance from the Centre based on the damage caused,” he said.

Rane, however, slammed the state government for not extending immediate financial assistance. “The state has a huge budget of Rs 4.5 lakh crore. In any case, the Centre would have compensated later, as it is normal practice…If the Centre has to do everything, why have a government in Maharashtra? Hand over the state government to the Centre,” he said.

The Union Minister for MSMEs, who was accompanied by Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly Devendra Fadnavis and Council Pravin Darekar, also visited Chiplun.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked me to tour the flood-affected Konkan and submit a report…We will consider accommodating the families, who lost homes due to the floods, under Prime Minister Awas Yojna,” Rane said.

Meanwhile, Thackeray said in a statement that he has decided not to celebrate his birthday on July 27 in the wake of the floods, and urged people not to put up any hoardings or posters or gather to meet him in person. He said there should not be any public function to mark the occasion and appealed for people to contribute to the Chief Minister’s relief fund to help those affected by floods and the pandemic.",flood,Maharashtra Floods 2021,"Maharashtra, India","July 22, 2021","July 27, 2021","['Raigad', 'Ratnagiri', 'Sindhudurg', 'Satara', 'Sangli', 'Kolhapur']","['Raigad: 454 mm', 'Ratnagiri: 350 mm', 'Sindhudurg: 300 mm', 'Satara: 250 mm', 'Sangli: 200 mm', 'Kolhapur: 150 mm']","['149 deaths', '2,29,074 people evacuated', '3,248 animal deaths', '17,300 poultry deaths']",,"['Damage to infrastructure', 'Loss of crops', 'Displacement of people']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The study “Improving outcomes for socioeconomic variables with coastal vulnerability index under significant sea-level rise: an approach from Mumbai coasts” was published in the global peer-reviewed journal Springer Nature on February 5.

A group of three researchers – Malay Kumar Pramanik from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi and fellow from the Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand; Poli Dash from Deshapran College of Teachers Education, Medinipur, West Bengal, and Dimple Behal from the School of Planning and Architecture, Bhopal – studied the coastline from Mira Bhayander to Alibag.

They studied a total of 274.1km, of which 50.75km (almost 20%) was considered to be very-highly vulnerable, based on 12 geological, physical and socio-economic variables. Another 60.91km had moderate vulnerability and 55.83km of the shoreline surveyed had very-low vulnerability.

Researchers found that the coastline in the eastern suburbs, including Kurla, Deonar, Shivaji Nagar, Trombay Koliwada and the western section of the Thane creek, was very susceptible to flooding. While areas like Borivli and Andheri fell under the low vulnerability scenario, other zones such as Gorai, Uttan, Uran, and Alibaug fell under the moderate to high vulnerability scenario.

“We identified that unsustainable urbanisation, unplanned development, and huge land conversion, combined with the destruction of mangroves, reclamation of waterways with construction debris, inadequate drainage, overflow, and absence of natural protectors over the past four to five decades has made the region highly vulnerable to flooding,” said Pramanik, lead author of the study.

The researchers involved in this study suggested that higher development activity combined with an increasing population per square kilometre was leading to coastal erosion, while activities such as tourism and fishing are contributing to an adverse influence along the coastal belt, especially along south Mumbai and the eastern suburbs.

The study has warned that under the direct impact of the increase in sea surface temperatures due to global warming, the rise in sea level is expected to cause coastal floods annually. The findings are along the lines of a previous international study by an American scientific research organisation, Climate Central, in October 2019, which found that large portions of the city’s suburbs and south Mumbai may be underwater by 2050 if emissions are not kept in check.

“While there is a need for sustainable development and alternate livelihood strategies, natural areas and ecosystems that have been degraded under developmental pressures need to be conserved and restored,” said Pramanik, adding that the research findings will help formulate policies to mitigate the impacts of coastal flooding along Mumbai.

Dr Roxy Mathew Koll, senior scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Management, Pune, who was not part of the study, said, “We need policies and action plans at the local level, based on conditions, geography, population, etc. Action plans should integrate flood forecasting with tidal information so we can have early warning systems. When making plans, we also need to think of both artificial protections as well as natural defences. Mangroves are a low-cost protection measure – they break the flow of floods, absorb their impacts. We should also be trying measures like bio-drainage, networks of canals that act as drainage during floods and can retain rainwater during dry periods.”

P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said, “We aim to develop a Sponge City Master Plan wherein chronic flood spots need to be addressed first. A consultant will be appointed to study and suggest flood control measures including holding ponds. Separately, we are also in talks to appoint a Japanese consultant to build underground holding ponds. Some of the flood control measures include water absorbent concrete, honeycomb water storage structures below roads and footpaths, water storage structures in each big development, building porous structures wherever possible.”",flood,Mumbai Coastal Floods,"Mumbai, India",2019-07-02,2019-07-05,"Kurla, Deonar, Shivaji Nagar, Trombay Koliwada and the western section of the Thane creek",100 mm,Rs 100 crore,0,Flooding caused major disruption to traffic and public transport.

105,105,mumbai,2021,https://news.trust.org/item/20210930170117-bilpj/,30 Sept 2021,Flood-prone Mumbai digs in on warming-worsened 'monsoon mayhem',"By Roli Srivastava

MUMBAI, Sept 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Like other store owners in this busy central Mumbai market, the Dadhia brothers have long kept the bottom shelf of their sari shop empty, to dodge the flooding that arrives every monsoon.

But they hope next year will be different.

Shopkeepers said a new underground water reservoir - constructed across from the Hindmata market and designed to stave off floods and store water - guzzled down heavy rains that pummelled Mumbai on a recent day, keeping their goods dry.

""I don't think we will need to keep the lower shelves empty anymore from next year,"" Harish Dadhia told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, smiling tentatively amid colourful saris.

Low-lying Hindmata - a regular haunt of television news channels portraying ""monsoon mayhem"" - is becoming a test of the solutions being launched to tackle more intense rainfall, warming seas and storms in India's financial capital.

Fiercer rains and about 170 landslides in Mumbai claimed more than 400 lives in the last decade, civic data shows.

Officials in the city of 12 million hope changes like the new flood tanks can help curb that toll of losses and damage.

Mumbai is part of the C40 Cities network, a group of nearly 100 major cities globally working to drive faster action on climate change.

Each has committed to delivering a climate action plan designed to spur uptake of clean energy, boost adaptation to climate shifts and turn the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change into an on-the-ground reality.

Mumbai launched its first Climate Action Plan (known as MCAP) this month. Amid dire predictions that large parts of the city could face inundation by 2050, it brings together different arms of the administration to try to fast-track solutions.

WET AND WINDY

The metropolis on the Arabian Sea coast has recorded ""extreme"" rainfall - defined as more than 200 mm (7.9 inches) in 24 hours - about a dozen times from 2017 to 2021, double the number of such events in the previous five years.

For Mumbai's citizens, the heavier rains mean inconvenience and heartache: more frequent wading through flooded roads, deaths of loved ones and worsening losses for business and homes as civic workers struggle to pump out the monsoon floodwater.

Aaditya Thackeray, environment and climate change minister for Maharashtra, the Indian state that has Mumbai as its capital, blamed those disastrous impacts on climate change.

Mumbai's annual monsoon period has shrunk from 120 to 70 days, he said, but the volume of rain has increased and is often now accompanied by gusty winds.

""For climate change action, we don't have the luxury of time... We need to put it into fast-track,"" Thackeray, who is also suburban Mumbai's ""guardian minister"", said in a statement to the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

GARDEN PITS

The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, the city's civic body, has earmarked 3 billion rupees ($41 million) in annual spending to make its new climate plan a reality, with officials saying more will be allocated if needed.

So far the city has constructed three floodwater tanks with a collective capacity of over 26 million litres, which it plans to siphon into the sea during low tide.

Conservationist Subhajit Mukherjee, founder of nonprofit Mission Green Mumbai, also is overseeing the installation of an expected 6,000 rainwater harvesting pits in more than 1,000 municipal gardens, to recharge groundwater and check flooding.

Public posters coax citizens to ""catch rainwater"" in the pits - which cost up to 3,000 rupees ($40) - in the open spaces of their apartment blocks. More than 500 have been constructed in about 125 gardens since March, Mukherjee said.

As well as preventing flooding, the collected rainwater is intended to conserve water supplies as the city's population and temperatures rise, driving up demand for water, he said.

Mumbai has not seen the serious water shortages faced in other Indian cities thanks to its seven rain-fed lakes.

But it is also planning a costly desalination plant to convert sea water into drinking water in the event of any shortages, officials said.

STORMY SEAS

As the planet - and Mumbai - heat up, the city faces another worry: cyclones.

The Arabian Sea is a particularly fast-warming part of the Indian Ocean, said climate scientist Roxy Mathew Koll.

""The Arabian Sea was cool and cyclone-shy, but we are seeing more cyclones with increased intensity and duration and chances of them coming close to the coast,"" said Koll, of the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.

Two cyclones neared Mumbai in 2020 and 2021 - something once rare and a worry in a city already struggling with flooding, he added.

Pressure to act on mounting risks may soon come from new quarters, including residents of upscale south Mumbai, home to the city's stock exchange, iconic Marine Drive, consulates and the palatial residences of some of India's richest.

Last August, the area was flooded for the first time in memory. Water inundated streets and parking lots and a landslide blocked a road commonly used by lawmakers and business heads.

Sheetal Mehta, who lives on Bhulabhai Desai Road, home to millionaires, saw her building's parking lot flood.

This year, cyclone-driven rain and winds were so strong residents sealed their windows with duct tape to stop water seeping in and window panes from shattering, she said.

""To think the sea used to have a calming effect on me,"" said Mehta, who now worries about the area's future.

CONCRETE JUNGLE?

Flood risks in Mumbai are compounded by its history of unplanned growth, which has destroyed flood-slowing mangroves and reduced once-wide river channels to constrained creeks.

Expansion of the city into the nearby seabed on reclaimed land also has been a problem, experts said.

A $1.7-billion, eight-lane coastal road is now under construction to connect Mumbai's south and north and reduce congestion.

It includes India's first undersea road tunnel, an underground parking area for about 2,000 cars and a 125-acre garden on the reclaimed land, according to the civic body.

Backers say the road will cut commuting time and fuel use in a city rated as the world's second-most congested after Moscow, according to a traffic rating index of 400 cities.

""If environmental fears are real, so is our daily struggle,"" said Tulika Bahl, 43, an information technology worker. ""Taking my son for his 40-minute football matches and getting to work meetings takes me hours.""

But Hussain Indorewala, an assistant professor at the Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute for Architecture & Environmental Studies in Mumbai, said he believes worsening flooding in south Mumbai may be linked to the road project and other construction.

Over the years, a business district has replaced mangroves, and a river was rerouted to accommodate airport expansion, Indorewala said.

""Mumbai's problems are a combination of extreme weather events and poor planning,"" he added, terming the new climate action plan ""theatre"" if the potential flooding impacts of projects like the new coastal road are not taken into account.

Officials said the road - a project of Uddhav Thackeray, chief minister of Maharashtra and father of minister Aaditya Thackeray - will include a sea wall of boulders to reduce storm surges and the impact of rising seas.

Lubaina Rangwala, associate director of the World Resources Institute's Ross Center for Sustainable Cities, which drafted Mumbai's new climate strategy said it has steered away from conventional ways of tackling congestion and flooding.

""The plan instead looks at prioritising walking, cycling, adding green cover and restoring wetlands and use of natural landscaping among other measures - instead of concrete embankments to address chronic flooding,"" she said.

106,106,mumbai,2021,https://mumbai.citizenmatters.in/mumbai-flooded-no-water-supply-why-25271,23 Jul 2021,This week Mumbai flooded and went thirsty at the same time. Here’s why,"On 18 July, Renita D’Souza and her family woke up with neck deep water in their house at Hanuman Nagar slum along the storm water drains. They found themselves surrounded by houses laced with dirt. “Our house was full of muck and we had to wade through a foot-deep grime throughout the day and there was no water to either drink or clean up,” she said.

The electricity supply to their house was disconnected as a precautionary measure. The entire neighbourhood could not light gas stoves. “We had to ask our children to buy vada pav because we couldn’t even start the gas or make tea at home,” she said.

Living beside a naala means fear of flooding every monsoon. Though the height of the wall along the naala was increased recently, it failed to reduce flooding in her house.

Heavy flooding has now created new problems for the city in unfamiliar ways. Suddenly, many parts of Mumbai found their water supply disrupted. Earlier this week, while Mumbaikars were wading through flooded roads, they were struggling to receive drinking water in their homes.

The 18 July flooding disrupted water supply in almost 65% of the city due to flooding within the Bhandup Water Purification Complex, the largest water treatment plant in Asia with a cumulative water filtration capacity of 2810 million litres per day.

The ingress of water into the Bhandup complex forced the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to shut down operations in its water filtration plants and forced it to clean up on a war footing.

The BMC now plans to erect a flood prevention wall around the Bhandup complex to prevent ingress of water from the adjoining Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) and to strengthen its drainage capacity. It is also planning to ask the SGNP to develop a naala to divert the water flowing towards Bhandup complex into the Tulsi Lake instead.

In the early hours on 18 July, citizens residing at the Hanuman Nagar slums at Kandivli (E) lining the Poisar river channel could not sleep throughout the night due to sudden heavy showers.

Climate change

Climate Change leading to heavier rainfalls is a huge part of the problem. The BMC recorded over 200 mm of rainfall due to five hours of uninterrupted heavy downpour between 11 pm to 4 am on July 17-18.

Families like D’Souza’s increasingly find themselves at the receiving end of climate change brought about by increasing urbanisation, lack of critical hydrological planning in the city and failure to implement the recommendations of the 2014 Chitale Committee report.

The report had recommended restoration and rejuvenation of the urban ecosystems like creeks, ponds, rivers, lakes and coastal zones to prevent flooding.

The D’Souzas lost a good portion of their ration stocks in the rains and Renita worried about stocking up again due to an Orange alert in the city for three days from July 19-22.

Reasons for flooding

Environmentalists accused flawed hydrological policies as responsible for the flooding.

Amrita Bhatacharjee of the Aarey Conservation Group said concretisation of floodplains and catchment areas along with building of the walls lining rivers like Mithi, Poisar and Oshiwara that originates from the Aarey forest, are responsible for the recent excessive floodings witnessed in the city. “When catchment areas are concretised, rain water does not get absorbed by the land and hence a larger volume of water enters the rivers causing floods,” she said.

Apart from concretisation of rivers and their tributaries, Gopal Jhaveri of River March, said BMC’s inability to implement available technological solutions, ignoring orders of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and recommendations of the Chitale Committee Report is leading to “myopic contractor-driven big-ticket policies”.

He blames the flooding in and around the Sanjay Gandhi National Park to the concretisation of the floodplains around the Dahisar river.

The large-scale reclamation on the Arabian Sea to build the Coastal Road is also said to be a cause for heavy flooding in the Southern part of the city that had largely been quite insular from floodings earlier.

Apart from low-lying areas and chronic flooding spots, rainwater gushed inside gated housing societies in South Mumbai that had previously never been affected.

As Mumbai witnesses a spate of construction activity, the city has also seen an increase in flooding spots. Twenty-four new spots have emerged in the island city since last year’s monsoon. According to data from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), there are 139 flooding spots that need to be tackled this monsoon.

Every year since 2015, ahead of the monsoon 24 ward officers prepare a list of the flooding spots and a specific plan and allocate a budget to tackle each spot. If vehicular and pedestrian traffic is completely disrupted after rainfall of 50-60 mm in an hour, the civic body lists the area as a flooding spot.

Other than temporary measures like dewatering pumps and clearing debris, ward officers are asked to prepare long-term remedial measures along with different agencies like Railways, MMRDA, MMRCL, SRA. Remedial measures include remodelling of draining channel, increasing the areas’ water absorption, addition of floodgates.

In the last two years, flooding spots have increased by 132. This year, there are 405 flooding spots, of which 176 are in the western suburbs and 139 in the island city. Till last year, there were 386 such spots and the year before that 273.

Activists and experts point to infrastructure projects like the coastal road project and metro work as reasons, but the administration emphasises that extreme weather events should be factored in.

The civic body blames the unprecedented amount of rainfall, development works including metro construction, housing projects, for the increase in flooding spots. P Velrasu, Additional Municipal Commissioner (Projects) and in charge of the stormwater drain department, said, “There is an increase in the number of flooding spots in the city. In addition to development works including road, water pipeline, metro, in last two years the city has witnessed unprecedented excessive rain in a short period. This has led to emergence of new flooding spots.”

According to a study by the CEEW, a Delhi-based think tank, Mumbai has witnessed a three-fold increase in the frequency of extreme flood events between 1969 and 2019.

Last year, on August 5, large parts of south Mumbai were inundated after the city reported its heaviest single-day downpour in August in 46 years with 293.8 mm of rainfall in 12 hours, considered “extremely heavy”. The following morning, the India Meteorological Department’s Colaba observatory recorded 331.8 mm rainfall in 24 hours — also the second-highest 24-hour rainfall recorded by the observatory in any month of monsoon since 1974.

BMC officials have recorded that 171 flooding spots are attended while 125 are in the process of being completed ahead of the monsoon, including Hindamata and Gandhi Market chronic flooding spots. BMC will work on at least nine flooding spots in coordination with other agencies. Eight of the new flooding spots are in the planning stage.

For Mumbai Central and Nair Hospital, officials from the stormwater drain department had claimed that ongoing Metro 3 work had damaged the old drain network, leading to flooding last year. Nair Hospital is one of the new flooding spots listed this year. While a box drain will be constructed by MMRC after completion of the metro, an additional dewatering pump is installed at the site.

In a meeting last week, the BMC has alerted MMRC on ensuring a flood-free monsoon.

“During joint site visits conducted with the BMC, some flood-prone spots have been identified including at Grant Road station, near Mumbai central, and Mahalaxmi station, Jagat Vidya Marg near BKC station, fish-market, few near Santacruz station. All precautionary measures including installation of pumps, de-silting of stormwater drains, connections of drains, cleaning and repairing of manholes are being implemented by MMRC under the guidance of BMC. MMRC will also deploy 24×7 emergency team at sites to address any emergency,” said an MMRC spokesperson.

Dr Bapu Gopinathrao Pawar. Joint Metropolitan Commissioner, MMRDA, said, “While long-term measures are planned and implemented by the BMC, we will assure that no waterlogging is caused by construction work undertaken by the MMRDA.”",flood,Mumbai Floods 2020,"Mumbai, India","August 5, 2020","August 7, 2020",South Mumbai,293.8 mm in 12 hours,Damage to property and infrastructure,0,"Flooding caused disruption to traffic and transportation, and damage to property and infrastructure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

This year the monsoon arrived in Mumbai on June 9, two days before schedule, and brought in a spell of heavy to extremely-heavy rain. The romance of the first rain falling on a hot and concretised city retreated rather quickly, as it always does, and was replaced by the nightmare that Mumbai monsoon is now synonymous with: flooding and disruptions.

It took barely three hours of hard rain that day for a number of areas to be water-logged. Vehicles struggled to stay on ground and people afloat, suburban train services were suspended for a few hours when tracks were inundated, several bus routes were cancelled, and airport operations were severely disrupted. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s claim of having de-silted storm water drains last month making Mumbai ‘rain ready’ fell flat yet another year. The story of the past many years repeated itself.

Will Mumbai ever be flood-free? The BMC officials aver that Mumbai has been facing occasional floods but that’s par for the course in a large, uneven and dense coastal city. Economists and industry leaders, worried about the enormous losses that pile up every monsoon, believe Mumbai can coast along like other international cities do with additional infrastructure.

Climate Change advocates point to the urban heat island effect, denudation of open green spaces, and continued reclamation of the sea to foretell that Mumbai may have more — not fewer — floods in the coming years. Many politicians blame rival parties or politicians for civic mismanagement which they hold responsible for the water-logging.

The reality is more complex than all these together.

Making Mumbai flood-free is neither a simple infrastructural issue nor only a matter of electing the right party to govern. The BMC with its annual budgets of Rs 25,000-30,000 crore in the last few years should not ideally cite a resource crunch to address this vital issue which disrupts urban life every year.

Since the watershed flash flood in July 2005, targeted anti-flood measures have been adopted. These include cleaning the Mithi River, augmenting the capacity of storm water drains, setting up radars and Advance Warning Systems in 60 locations, de-silting the drainage system before the monsoon, and installing water pumps to drain out rain water. More can be done, but these do not seem to have helped.

Perhaps, the question to ask is: Can Mumbai ever be flood-free? The answer flows into many realms.

First, Mumbai’s natural and unique topography renders the city somewhat like a saucer with dips in its centre where rain water tends to collect. Also, popular culture paints Mumbai as an island city, but the complex reality is that it is more an estuary with rivers running into spaces between little natural islands which were made contiguous by reclaiming the sea in between them. Together, this means several low-lying areas across the city where rainwater will naturally collect, sometimes for hours.

Second, the natural disadvantages are compounded by human factors: construction permits were issued in the last four decades without foregrounding the topographical factors, rampant concretisation of pavements and private areas reduced the soaking capacity of top soil, Mumbai’s four major rivers — Mithi, Oshiwara, Poisar and Dahisar — have been used as sewage drains severely compromising their capacity to carry rain water to the sea.

New infrastructure such as the Worli-Bandra sea link and under-construction coastal road disrupted the inter-tidal areas and mangroves which were like Mumbai’s kitchen sinks, urban footprint increased by three-four times in the last four decades reducing open areas where rainwater stood and gradually seeped in, continued reclamation and shifting coastline brought the sea closer to the city when its level has risen due to Climate Change. Therefore, tides hit the city harder than earlier. When severe rainfall coincides with high tides, as it does twice-thrice every monsoon, drains are thoroughly overwhelmed by tidal water and rain water, leading to floods.

Third, floods and water-logging have increased in the last 15 years or so. Academic studies show that Mumbai has had more extremely heavy rain days during every monsoon in this time than any time earlier, that these are a feature of the annual monsoon and not an outlier phenomenon, that the average heavy to very-heavy rainfall tends to be 120 to 280 millimetres in 12 hours, which is the equivalent of six to 12 days of rain in half a day, and that the inconsistencies in rainfall across the city — south Mumbai records in two digits while suburbs get over 200 mm the same day — challenges most urban planning and mitigation measures.

In August 2017, when Mumbai came to a standstill, Andheri, where the airport is located, recorded a staggering 315 mm rain in a day; the overflowing Mithi and storm water drains could not carry it all to the sea. Last August, the city recorded 331mm rain in a day. Urban planners say it is hard to design or construct drainage systems to handle such a load; there is no option but to build Climate Change mitigation measures into the city’s flood management.

Forget being flood-free, Mumbai needs to urgently prepare to face annual floods and bounce back with minimum damage — that’s being flood-resilient.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,severe

“A total of 112 people have lost their lives due to heavy rains till Saturday morning (in Maharashtra). These include 52 in Raigad, 13 in Satara, four in Mumbai and nearby areas, one in Pune, 21 in Ratnagiri, seven in Kolhapur, 12 in Thane and two in Sindhudurg. 99 people are missing till Saturday morning,” the deputy CM said.

Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar, however, put the death toll much higher. “138 deaths have been reported due to floods and other rain-related incidents,” he said, earlier in the day.

The toll is likely to increase, with heavy rainfall stalling rescue operations in several areas. Till Saturday evening, a team of the police and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) alone, recovered at least 86 bodies47 in Raigad district’s Taliye village, 28 bodies in Satara district and 11 in Ratnagiri.

According to official data, 890 villages in nine districts have been affected since Thursday.

The state government “will see no such incidents happen in the future”, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said after a visit to Taliye village in one of the worst-hit Raigad district.

“The state government will see no such incidents will happen in future and even if they happen, no human life will be lost in future. In order to achieve this, the state government will have to rehabilitate all the villages located at hillslopes and foothills. The residents of such villages will be resettled at safer places,” Thackeray said after reviewing the ground situation in Taliye.

A portion of a hillock flattened most of the Taliye village late on Thursday, burying at least 32 houses. Till Saturday, the landslide claimed 49 lives. At least 50 people are still feared trapped under the debris.

The chief minister said the state government will also prepare a water management scheme to reduce the instances of flooding. “We have started working on formulating a water management scheme to overcome the flood situation in the state. It will ensure management of excessive water collected in catchment areas of dams due to heavy rains which often result in floods following discharge from dams,” Thackeray said.

Western Maharashtra’s Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli districts, which are among the worst affected by the flooding, also saw massive devastation due to flooding in 2019.

Teams of the local administrations and the State Disaster Relief Force, along with NDRF, Coast Guard, Navy and Army, are undertaking rescue operations in the affected areas.

The NDRF has enhanced the number of its teams from 26 to 34 for the operations, a spokesperson said Saturday.

“In view of the severity of the situation, additional eight NDRF teams have been airlifted from Kolkata and Vadodara base which are being deployed in affected areas of Maharashtra,” the spokesperson said.

The force is tracking the India Meteorological Department’s weather forecast and the Central Water Commission’s report with regard to Mumbai and coastal districts of the Konkan region in Maharashtra that are witnessing heavy rainfall since the last few days, the spokesperson said, after residents in several areas complained about the slow pace of the rescue work.

Apart from the rescue operations, the administration is struggling to restore water and electricity supply and arrange food and medicines in affected areas.

The government is planning to distribute ration kits, including rice, pulses and kerosene in the affected areas, the deputy CM told mediapersons.

Pawar also announced a financial assistance of ₹5 lakh each to the kin of the victims, while the Central government has announced ₹2 lakh each.

While flood water in many Konkan areas is receding, the discharge of water from dams led to further overflowing of some rivers and rise in flood water levels in many areas of Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts, officials said.

IMD, meanwhile, has forecast a reduction in rainfall intensity over the next 24 hours. “Further reduction in rainfall intensity is very likely along the west coast, including Konkan, Goa and adjoining interior Maharashtra, during the next 24 hours,” the IMD said.

CM Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with deputy CM Ajit Pawar, relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar, agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse on Friday. He had held a review meeting with senior officials on Monday. “The broader outline of the package has been finalised. The relief for losses of crops, domestic structures and belongings will be compensated at a higher rate than the set norms of the National Disaster Response Fund”, said an official from the relief and rehabilitation department.

“The state had given additional compensation by keeping the norms aside during the Nisarga and Tauktae cyclones in the past two years. Apart from it, the state is also expected to grant a relief package to traders and labourers who have sustained losses due to the flooding,”added the official from the relief and rehabilitation department.

The district administrations have been directed to identify land for the rehabilitation of the villages that were devastated because of the landslide. At least 11 landslides were reported in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Satara, claiming several lives. “Funds would not be the problem for the rehabilitation of these villages as we have decided to utilise CSR funds of the corporate houses, along with the central funding. The identification of the land for the relocation of these villages would be a challenging job as many parameters need to be complied with, to ensure that the villages do not meet with a similar fate in future,” an official from the CMO said.

Among the 209 deaths, the highest (95) are from Raigad, which has witnessed three landslides, followed by 45 in Satara and 35 in Ratnagiri. Three people are still missing in Satara, while one each is missing in Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Kolhapur, Pune and Thane.

434,181 people from eight-affected districts have been shifted to safer places. Among them 211,808 are from Sangli , 162,564 are from Kolhapur, 49,149 from Satara and remaining from other districts. 251,304 of them have been put up at the shelters erected by the government and NGOs, while remaining have been staying at their relatives’ homes.

Minister of state and Raigad’s guardian minister Aditi Tatkare has said that she had requested the government to consider compensation to the next of kin of the people who have gone missing. “I am requesting the government to give ex gratia to the next of kin of the people who are not traceable and unlikely to be traced now,” she said.

NDRF has called of the search and rescue operation from all the landslide sites and has also withdrawn a few more companies on Tuesday. After withdrawing 12 of the total 34 companies on Monday, six more companies were withdrawn on Tuesday. 16 NDRF teams are still deployed with highest, six , being in Kolhapur and 4 in Sangli. Though water level in most of the rivers in western Maharashtra has receded, Panchaganga river in Kolhapur is still flowing at 45 feet against its danger level of 43 feet.

Districts in Konkan are on orange alert for Thursday and in the wake of the alert, the NDRF teams are expected to be stay put for a few more days as a precautionary measure. “In the wake of the orange alert for the Konkan on Thursday, teams of NDRF will be kept stationed in the affected districts. Similarly, the people who have been evacuated to safer places will not be allowed to go back to their respective homes for few days. In some districts like Ratnagiri, the evacuated people who have suffered no losses to their houses have started going back,” said an official from Mantralaya.

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar announced to constitute a committee under retired bureaucrat Eknath Patil to study the measures that need to be taken for the smooth flow of river water. “The committee will recommend the measures including widening and deepening of the river to reduce the intensity of the flooding. We have also decided to remove the encroachments in the riverbeds. The illegal constructions will be immediately removed and the action will be taken against the officials responsible for them,” he said during a press conference in Kolhapur on Tuesday. He visited flood-ravaged Satara, Kolhapur and Sangli over the past two days.

Pawar said that the state government will also speak to union transport minister Nitin Gadkari requesting him to construct bridges on NH4 above level of the flooding in 2005, 2019 and 2021 to ensure the smooth vehicular traffic. The highway was opened for traffic on Tuesday after keeping it shut for four days. Pawar said that the district administrations have been told to complete the assessment of the losses due to the floods at the earliest.

The Madhav Gadgil committee on Western Ghats ecology and Vadnere committee appointed after the 2019 floods to recommend measures to avoid floods have submitted their comprehensive reports to the governments. Gurudas Nulkar, ecologist and trustee, Ecological Society, said, “Sahyadri range is the source region of rivers and the rain gets divided into Konkan and Deccan Plateau equally. Concentration of the rain run-off in the floodplain and cloudburst led to the flooding. Urbanisation has resulted in change in the natural landscape which takes the shape of saucer and the use of cement, tar, paver blocks result in hardscaping of the structures. This obstructs the percolation of the water,” he said.

“Similarly, the construction in river banks and floodplains lead to constricting of river channels. Owing to this, the rivers cannot hold the volume of water they were designed to hold naturally. Destruction to the riparian zones, which give stability to river banks, damage the first and second order streams due to construction and lead to disturbance of ecosystem. Secondly, the city drainage system is falling short for the flood waters. The pattern of the monsoon has changed. We get the season’s rainfall in just four days as cloudburst has become common phenomenon due to the climate change,” he said.

The Maharashtra government had appointed an expert committee of 10 members, headed by retired head of irrigation department Nandkumar Vadnere, in August 2019 immediately after the flooding in July-August that year to study the reasons and propose technical measures. Besides the demarcation of restricted zones by marking flood lines and identifying the flood plains, the committee had recommended removal and rehabilitation of encroachments. It recommended advanced weather forecasting systems, real time decision support (RTDS) systems, restoration of natural waterways and their desilting, strengthening of river meanders, construction of more flood dams, temporary flood storage tanks. The committee had also recommended strict implementation of the guidelines on the management of floods and urban flooding issued by National Disaster Management Authority in 2008 and 2010. The committee had recommended forming Flood Zoning Authority for two districts. It also recommended amendment in clause 16 of the Maharashtra Irrigation Act for demarcation of floodplain zones.

“The removal of encroachments is directly linked to political vote banks and hence nobody dares to touch them,” Nulkar said.

Madhav Gadgil, who headed the state appointed Western Ghat Ecology Expert Panel in 2010-11, said, “We had said that haphazard planning of highways by cutting mountains slopes, unchecked construction and mining activities should not be done. The recommendations were not followed by the government.”

Pradeep Purandare, retired professor from WALMI, irrigation expert and member of Vadnere committee, said, “The accurate balance between water stock in reservoirs and discharge of water is key.”

Shailaja Deshpande, ecologist and founder-director of Living River Foundation, Pune, said, “The committees have recommended their conservation to protect the ecosystem. The subsequent Kasturangan committee report which diluted Gadgil committee report by 50%, too, has been overlooked by authorities. There is no objection to the development, but there should have been watershed approach to it. The construction should be done by taking the particular landscape into consideration and respecting the ecosystem there.”

Deshpande said, “Areas like Chiplun, Mahad city will require specific measures for managing floods. In cities like Kolhapur, Sangli and confluence regions, floods will get retained over longer period due to morphological features of the landscape.”

Opposition leader and former CM Devendra Fadnavis said, “The state, by accepting the Vadnere committee report, should constitute a separate department for implementation of the recommendations. The state should implement the World Bank approved 2019-project for the diversion of the flood water to drought-prone areas through diversion canals.”

Deshpande also suggested dedicated guidelines for infrastructural developments in the districts which frequently witness the flooding.

Natural green belts along flood plains will act like buffers to manage and reduce intensity of floods.

Vijaykumar Gautam, officer on special duty , water resources department, said, “We have started holistic approach towards these problem by chalking out short-, mid- and long-term measures. For rapid alerts and forecast, 7 of the 26 Real Time Decision Support systems on rivers in Konkan will be installed in next three months. Similarly, there would be comprehensive plan for water management. Construction within the blue and red lines is the major problem.”

Gautam said completion of incomplete dams on Kalu, Shai in MMR and Kaal in Konkan is the need of the hour. “Had the dam on Kaal been completed within time, the water level in Vashisthi would not have increased more than 4ft, which had swelled to 11ft this time. Koyana absorbed 3.5 lakh cusecs of water, by releasing just 50,000 cusecs of water and played a great role of flood mitigation,” he said.

Vijay Nahata, member of State Environment Impact Assessment Committee, said, “There are financial constraints before the state while implementing the recommendations given by any committee. The government has started taking corrective steps in response.”

Thackeray has also requested Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to direct the companies to consider the assessment done by the state revenue authorities for the settlement of the claims. In a letter to Sitharaman, Thackeray said that the flood-affected people from Konkan and western Maharashtra have been waiting for the settlement of the claims against the insurance of their vehicles, shops and houses.

“The insurance companies have agreed to release 50% of the claim amount based on the assessment by the revenue department. However, they will need directives from the Central government to their headquarters and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. The Centre has previously given such directives during the floods in Kerala and Jammu and Kashmir,” the letter stated.

Thackeray also asked banks to extend loans for the working capital at concessional rates to traders who have sustained losses in the floods. Banks have also been asked to give waiver to pay the instalments of their pending loans.

Thackeray, in the letter, has requested Sitharaman for directives to the banks, too. Banks and insurance companies have also been told to make the procedure consumer-friendly while settling the claims or giving loans. They have also been asked not insist on any tedious process and documentation, considering the situation.

State relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said that the government has asked the Centre to send its teams to assess the losses, at the earliest. He said that the disbursement of ₹10,000 per household as immediate assistance will begin from Friday.

Meanwhile, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray faced the wrath of locals during his visit to Chiplun. A resident asked him what he has done as the environment minister. The resident pointed at the silted rivers which caused flooding and the prolonged work of the bridge on Vashishti river.

“You please ensure that the rivers are desilted so that they would not cause the flooding. What have you done as environment minister? You should tour the affected areas on foot to realise the plight of the people and visit us at least once a month. People are not intimated in advance while discharging water from the dams and it causes the whole problem,” the resident told Aaditya during their interaction.

He, however, heard the resident patiently and said the resident was right. Aaditya also assured the resident that take corrective action will be taken.

Later he said, “The residents have every right to express themselves freely as they have been suffering all these days. In fact, we have been touring to understand their plight and what they have faced.”

Thackeray also visited a few affected villages in Raigad district. He will visit flood-hit Kolhapur on Friday. After visiting the flood-ravaged villages in Raigad and Ratnagiri on Saturday and Sunday respectively, Thackeray was scheduled to visit Satara in western Maharashtra on Monday, but his helicopter could not land at Koyana Nagar due to bad weather conditions.

A few state and national highways are still shut for vehicular traffic. The Goa-Mumbai highway between Khed and Chiplun is partially shut for heavy vehicles and the Ratnagiri-Kolhapur highway is shut in Amba ghat.

Sangli collector Abhijeet Chaudhari issued a statement on Thursday warning citizens to take due care in the wake of the additional water discharge from reservoirs, keeping the forecast of heavy rainfall in mind.

“To regulate the water level and keeping the potential heavy rainfall in mind, there could be additional discharge of water from the dams, leading to the rise in the water level in Krishna [river] by around 2 feet. The water level in Krishna river may rise up to 42 feet. The villagers and farmers on the banks of the river are warned to take due care,” Chaudhari has said.

At 41.4 feet, the water level of Panchganga river receded below its danger level, which is 43ft, almost after a week. Its warning level is 39ft.

Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis visited the flood-affected villages in Sangli on Thursday. He criticised the state government for the “delay” in the assistance to flood-affected farmers and villagers.

“The state government should immediately release the relief without waiting to complete the formalities. The government has been pointing fingers at the Centre to shrug off its own responsibility. During our government, we had given relief to the 2019-flood affected people on an immediate basis,” he said.

The death toll in the flood-ravaged districts since July 22 stands at 213, even as 52 people have sustained injuries and eight are still untraceable. Death of domestic animals stands at 398, while 60,882 poultry birds have been reported to have died. Around 435,879 people from eight districts have been evacuated to safer places, while 53,295 of them are staying in 349 shelters built by the government and NGOs.

Half of the NDRF teams have been withdrawn from the affected districts and 16 NDRF teams and two army teams are stationed in seven districts for disaster response work, including Kolhapur (with six teams) and Sangli (with four teams) , which still have heavy rainfall forecast.

The state government has deferred its decision of relief package to the flood-affected people as it is wary of the financial burden.

“The losses are expected to cross well beyond ₹5,000 crore from the preliminary estimates of ₹4,000 crore. We have already hiked the compensation given to the affected people. Surprisingly, the losses to the crops in districts like Nanded, where severity of the rainfall was not as high as in western Maharashtra, have been reported to be more than 70,000 hectares (ha). We have also witnessed in the past that the figures of the crop losses are inflated extensively.

In four districts of western Maharashtra, the losses to the crops, as per the preliminary estimates, is 111,648 ha, while it is more than 100,000 ha in eight districts of central Maharashtra. The total estimated crop losses is more than 350,000 ha.

Speaking at the launch of Mumbai Climate Action Plan and its website at the hands of Maharashtra Environment and Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray on Friday, Chahal said about 70 per cent of the city's A, B, C and D wards in south Mumbai will be underwater due to climate change.

He said that nature has been giving warnings, but if people do not ""wake up"" then the situation would turn ""dangerous"".

""Eighty per cent of the areas like Cuffe Parade, Nariman Point and Mantralaya will be underwater...Means going to disappear,"" he said.

The civic chief also said that it is a matter of just 25-30 years as 2050 is not too far.

""We are getting warnings from nature and if we do not wake up, it will be a dangerous situation for the next 25 years. And it will not only be the next generation but the current generation will also suffer,"" Chahal warned.

He said that Mumbai is the first city in South Asia that is preparing its climate action plan and acting on it.

""Earlier, we used to hear about climate change events like melting glaciers, but not directly affecting us. But now it has come to our doorstep,"" he added.

Chahal said that last year for the first time in 129 years, a cyclone (Nisarga) hit Mumbai and thereafter in the last 15 months, there have been three cyclones. After that, on August 5, 2020, about 5 to 5.5 feet water was accumulated at Nariman point.

""There was no cyclone warning that day, but considering the parameters, it was a cyclone,"" Chahal said.

Highlighting that the city has witnessed some extreme weather condictions recently, he said that the city faced Tauktae cyclone in Mumbai and witnessed 214 mm rain on May 17, though monsoon arrives here on June 6 or 7.

Before June 9, Mumbai recorded 84 per cent of the June rainfall and in July, 70 per cent of month's average rainfall was received in just four days from July 17 to 20, he said.

Under the Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP), the data assessment has identified areas and communities most vulnerable given increasing climate uncertainty, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said in a release.

Data from across BMC's 37 automatic weather stations (AWS) over the past 10 years suggests that on an average, Mumbai has seen six heavy, five very heavy, and four extremely heavy rainfall days per year. And for all the rainfall that occurs during the monsoon season in Mumbai, each year, approximately 10 per cent falls under the heavy category, nine per cent very heavy, and six per cent extremely heavy.

According to the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) classification, daily rainfall from 64.5 mm to 115.5 mm is considered 'heavy', 115.6 mm to 204.4mm 'very heavy' and more than 204.5mm is 'extreme'.

""The four-year period between 2017 and 2020 has seen a steady increase in the extremely heavy rainfall events. This indicates that the frequency of such extreme weather events is increasing for the city of Mumbai especially over the past four years,"" said Lubaina Rangwala, Associate Director, WRI India Ross Center for Sustainable Cities.",issue,Mumbai Floods,"Mumbai, India",2020-08-05,2020-08-06,"['Cuffe Parade', 'Nariman Point', 'Mantralaya']",['214 mm'],['$100 million'],['10'],"['80% of the areas like Cuffe Parade, Nariman Point and Mantralaya will be underwater']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Flooding in Mithi river and Bhandup water treatment plant should be a wake-up call for Mumbai, and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray should immediately convene a meeting of all elected representatives, academics, and experts to find a solution to the crisis that has left the city partially paralysed, said Bandra (West) BJP MLA Ashish Shelar on Monday.

Shelar said, “Increased water levels in Mithi river even when there is no high tide is a serious matter. The water level did not recede as expected.

Homes and fields were submerged, and the administration had to scramble to relocate families and livestock in a total of nine badly affected districts as a depression caused by Cyclone Gulab, which made landfall on the east coast, dumped rain on Maharashtra, especially on the drought-prone Marathwada region.

The state government had to call in the NDRF for rescue operations. Government agencies rescued more than 300 people.

Some districts of Vidarbha were also affected. A Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation spokesperson said that four people died when a bus bound from Nagpur to Nanded was swept off an inundated culvert at a village in Yavatmal. Two injured passengers were rescued.

This is the third natural calamity to strike Maharashtra after Cyclone Tauktae in May and the severe rain that caused floods and deadly landslides in Konkan and Western Maharashtra in July this year.

Heavy rain lashed all eight districts of Marathwada over the last two days, filling up several dams in the region, as a result of which water had to be discharged from these catchments, causing flooding downstream. Rain continued to pour in the area through Tuesday.

All 18 gates of Manjara dam and 11 gates of Majalgaon dam, both located in Beed, had to be opened, resulting in water discharge of 78,397 cusecs and 80,534 cusecs, respectively. The water release caused flooding in Beed and adjoining Latur districts. In neighbouring Nanded, the water discharge from Vishnupuri dam was highest at 1,11,594 cusecs.

Irrigation department officers said that gates of other dams in the area, including Yeldari Lower Dudhna, Upper Manar Vishnupur, Isapur, Dhalegaon, Tarugavhan, Mudgal, Muli, Digras, Anteshwar, Shankarrao Chavan Dam, Amudra, Belegaon and Babhali were all opened.

In a state cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray asked all guardian ministers of affected districts to go on inspection tours. He has called another meeting of cabinet ministers and government officials on Wednesday evening.

Water Resources Minister Jayantrao Patil, who was touring Beed district, said, “All eight districts of Marathwada — Beed, Latur, Osmanabad, Jalna, Parbhani, Hingoli, Aurangabad, Nanded — are hit by the cyclone (Gulab). The heavy rain for the last 24 hours led to overflowing of dams, canals and rivers. We are closely monitoring the level of rain in the catchment areas of Jaikwadi dam.”

Jaikawadi or Nathsagar, the largest irrigation project on the river Godavari in Paithan in Aurangabad district, was 84 per cent full.

Patil, who reviewed dam water levels across the state, said, “The water rise in Godavari river flowing through Nashik is a concern. We have directed the district collectors to relocate families along the river banks to safer destinations.”

Nanded DIG Nisar Tamboli said, “Many areas are under water and all dams except Jayakwadi are full. The doors of all these dams are opened. If the flow increases at night, then Nanded may face flooding.”

PWD Minister Ashok Chavan, who hails from Nanded, said, “The damage to Marathwada is extensive. There is damage to crops, roads, bridges and power supply network. The CM has called a meeting tomorrow (Wednesday) to assess the situation.”

The damage to agricultural areas and houses is yet to be quantified, but government officials said the damage to the standing kharif soya crop was bound to be extensive. Livestock was also lost.

The Indian Air Force sent two helicopters, which airlifted one team each of the NDRF for rescue operations in Latur and Osmanabad districts.

In Sarsa village in Latur, the NDRF deployed boats and a helicopter for the rescue of 47 persons stranded on the banks or river Manjara, according to district administration officials.

Latur District Collector Prithviraj B P said, “At least 158 villages in the district were hit by the dam water discharge.”

In addition, 16 people were rescued by an NDRF helicopter in Osmanabad.

Minister for Relief and Rehabilitation Vijay Waddetiwar said, “Farmers are the worst hit by the cyclone. Their entire crop has been damaged. Apart from the state’s compensation under NDRF norms, we will urge the Centre to provide adequate financial assistance.”

Medical Education Minister and Latur Guardian Minister Amit Deshmukh said, “The irrigation department has discharged a lot of water from the dams and as a result, the fields have gone under water. If the water level does not recede, there will be great damage to soyabean crop. We have asked the agriculture and revenue machinery to do the surveys immediately.”

Deshmukh was touring Latur at night. He said that a complaint was received in Ahmedpur area in Latur of an unknown person getting washed away in floods and the authorities were verifying it.

Beed Guardian Minister Dhananjay Munde, who was also on a tour of his district, said the government would help the farmers.

Of the 11 districts in Vidarbha, the worst hit by the rain were Buldhana, Akola, Washim, Yavatmal and Chandrapur.

The Nanded-Nagpur bus (MH14 BT5018) was swept off after departing from Umarkhed for Nagpur. The driver decided to drive into the swollen nullah. “But the edges of the culvert were not visible due to overflowing water, resulting in the driver taking the bus down the culvert from the left side. The bus was then swept some distance by the strong water current and got stuck to a tree. There it got quickly filled up with water,” said Yavatmal Superintendent of Police Dilip Bhujbal.

There were only six persons inside the bus, including the driver and conductor. While one passenger managed to escape, one other was pulled out to safety by a rescue team. The SP said the driver and conductor were among the four dead. Three bodies have been fished out of the nullah, and a fourth, that of the driver, had not yet been located.

The survivors are Sharad Fulmali, 28, and Subramaniam Suryanarayan Tokla, 48. The deceased whose bodies were recovered were bus conductor Bhimrao Nagarikar from Nagpur, Sheikh Ibrahim, 50, from Hyderabad and Indal Ramprasad Mahindra, 35, from Karol village in Pusad. Driver Suresh Surewar from Nagpur is yet to be traced.

The incident was captured on mobile phones by onlookers

MSRTC managing director Shekhar Channe said the kin of passengers who had died would get Rs 10 lakh each.

Maharashtra Floods LIVE Updates: Over 84,000 shifted to safer places in Pune

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted 'heavy to very heavy rains' at a few places in Mumbai, Thane and Palghar on Friday. Earlier on Thursday, rains lashed many parts of the state leaving people stranded. Heavy rainfall also led to massive waterlogging, disruption of local train services and vehicular traffic across several locations in the city and its suburbs.Meanwhile, the MSRTC came to the rescue of stranded people. It arranged for buses with the help of the Central Railway Mumbai division for passengers who were stranded in trains in far-flung suburbs -- from Umbermali/Kasara to Kalyan. It operated 133 buses between Igatpuri and Kasara/Kalyan and ferried 5,800 passengers, said transport minister Anil Parab. On the Mumbai Pune route, 65 special buses were operated from Pune to Mumbai and nine from Mumbai to Pune to ferry those stranded en route.Stay tuned to get more updates...Read Less",flood,Maharashtra Floods,"Maharashtra, India","July 23, 2021","July 24, 2021","['Mumbai', 'Thane', 'Palghar', 'Pune']",Heavy to very heavy rains,"Massive waterlogging, disruption of local train services and vehicular traffic",0,People stranded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

While residents with homes on higher floors were luckier in this regard, Dutta Wadhone, who lives on the second floor of a seven-storey building, said, “Water did not enter our home luckily, but it submerged the elevator shaft in the high-rise building next to ours. The building's lift was non-functional for four days after June 9, and residents who live on the topmost floors were forced to use the staircase.”

Every monsoon, residents of Sindhi Society, which is a colony of over 162 plots, witness waterlogged streets. However, this year is the first time since the deluge of 2005 that water entered most homes, leaving the residents running from pillar to post to ensure it does not repeat.

According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) authorities, Sindhi Society is located in a low-lying area and is prone to flooding due to its natural topography.

A senior civic official from the storm water drains department said, “I have not yet inspected this particular waterlogging spot after June 9. However, over the years, as road level has increased due to repair and resurfacing work, the private premises in this area have naturally become low-lying. BMC has individual plans for mitigating waterlogging in chronic flooding spots. In this case, the Mahul pumping station will bring relief.”

Owing to repeated encounters with waterlogging every year, residents have come up with solutions for their houses.

Davinder Gupta, who lives in an independent building inside Sindhi Society premises, raised the elevation of his entire house by 4feet, after the 2005 deluge. He said, “Earlier, if water entered my house during the monsoon, I have seen my fridge being lifted off the floor, and float on the water surface. I raised the elevation of my entire house after the 2005 deluge. However, I still had ankle deep water in my house this monsoon.”

Prithviraj Chauhan, additional municipal commissioner of the M/West ward, with jurisdiction over this area, said, “Immediately after June 9, I visited the area and directed the localised work to be taken up to mitigate waterlogging during the rest of the monsoon. BMC staff checked all drains in the area end to end for blockages. I also directed all drains in the area to be inspected and re-cleaned.”

Chauhan attributed the incident partly to the very heavy rain in Chembur on June 9. He said, “Chembur recorded among the highest amount of rainfall across the city, in a very short span.”

Residents of this society met with their elected representatives earlier this week, seeking a resolution to the problem. Rahul Shewale, MP representing the area, said, “I met the residents and have taken note of their issues. The BMC is already working on short-term localised solutions for this problem. In the long run, once the Mahul pumping station is set up and operational, it will bring relief to waterlogging problems in this area.”",flood,Sindhi Society Flood,"Chembur, Mumbai, India","June 9, 2022","June 10, 2022",Sindhi Society,100 mm,Ankle-deep water entered most homes,0,Residents had to use the staircase for four days,"The BMC is working on short-term localised solutions for this problem.

Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil on Friday said, “Maharashtra is communicating with Karnataka government. At present, the water discharge from Almatti dam is up to two lakh cusecs. We are requesting the Karnataka government to increase the water discharge in Almatti dam.”

The rising water levels in the Krishna basin due to incessant rainfall has led to floods in several cities and villages.

While admitting that the situation in Sangli, Satara and Kolhapur cities in western Maharashtra was “very alarming”, Patil said, “The foremost challenge is to relocate the people living in flood-sensitive areas to safer destinations. This is a daunting task, and the entire state government machinery has swung into action.”

Making an ardent appeal to people not to risk their lives, Patil said, “The flood situation in Sangli, Satara and Kolhapur is likely to aggravate further. We have to take a realistic approach. Relocating people living along rivers and dams is a must.”

Patil said people should move with their family members and animals, and reassured that the state administration would provide shelter houses and essentials to cope with the crisis. He said people were sometimes apprehensive of shifted due to their animals, like cows and cattle, but emphasised that the government would provide them with necessary arrangements.

Due to the overnight rains, water discharge from Koyna dam has been increased to 10,000 cusecs from Friday. The water discharge from Warna dam is 32,000 cusecs.

Patil warned that the water discharge from Koyna and Warna will lead to floods in nearby villages. “Higher water discharge from these two dams was necessary to avert a bigger disaster ahead. If rains continue with same intensity, water levels in dams and catchment areas will also rise. So, we have to release the water at regular intervals,” he said.

Koyna has received 704 mm rainfall so far. Till now, the maximum record of water within 24 hours in Koyna dam has been 12 TMC. But, overnight rain saw Koyna dam receiving 18 TMC water.

“The NDRF team is on ground. They are doing their best to reach out to people,” Patil said.

He appealed to district officers, village sarpanch and elected representatives to prioritise the relocation of people from flood sensitive areas to safer locations.

“Don’t wait for rescue teams. Start the relocation of people living in danger zone immediately,” Patil said. “The administration should keep in mind that the situation could become worse in next 24 to 48 hours if the rains continue.”",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Click here

A government official privy to the development, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The numbers presented to the state cabinet are an overview of the most prominent disasters since 2019, such as Cyclones Kyarr, Nisarga and Tauktae, last year’s floods in Vidarbha and the recent Konkan floods. An amount of ₹14,000 crore was the outlay in compensation that was directly paid toward the rehabilitation of affected persons. The real cost of the disasters is of course much higher because a lot of money has to also be allocated toward infrastructure repairs.”

Last year alone, Maharashtra paid about ₹5,500 crore as compensation for extreme weather events, including hail storms, unseasonal rainfall, extended monsoon rainfall, cyclone, heat waves, lightning and cold waves, data obtained from the state disaster management authority and the environment and the climate change department has revealed.

Most of this amount was disbursed to farmers for agricultural damages – losses of property and crops – after a delay in withdrawal of monsoon led to unseasonal heavy rainfall and damage of harvested crops such as cotton, sugarcane, gram and several fruit harvests. Official data shows that agricultural damage was witnessed over 700,000 hectares across 10 districts in central and western Maharashtra, and almost 89,000 hectares across 36 talukas in the Vidarbha region.

But Maharashtra’s total cost incurred due to climate disasters for the year 2020 alone comes to a total of ₹13,000 crore, which includes at least another ₹4,000 crore spent toward fixing damaged roads, reinstating water supplies, refurbishing damaged power infrastructure and various other urban and rural infrastructure fixes, along with ex gratia payments made to victims of heat waves, cold waves and lightning strikes.

It also includes at least ₹568 crore that was spent on disaster relief after Cyclone Nisarga hit last June, along with about ₹912 crore that was spent on stormwater drains and flood mitigation projects in Mumbai alone. The Mumbai civic body also spent an additional ₹36 crore for building water-holding structures under the sponge city master plan, disaster management data shows.

This year, the state government has paid compensation of at least ₹227 crore directly to the victims of Cyclone Tauktae and Konkan floods, but the total cost of climate disasters in the ongoing calendar year is likely to be in excess of ₹11,500 crore (which is the strength of the relief package announced by the Maharashtra on August 2).

“We will have to wait and see how things pan out over the rest of the year. If there are unseasonal rains in October again and crop harvesting is affected, the total cost of climate related disasters will be higher than in 2020,” said the government official quoted above.

Even though experts were alarmed at the scale of these losses, they emphasized that the real cost of climate change-induced disasters are intangible.

“The government of Maharashtra, which at the very least is cognizant of emerging climate science, may have allotted ₹11,500 as relief to flood victims, but that will only make up for calculable losses and provide relief to the poorest of the poor. That compensation is necessary of course, but try and imagine for a second the larger economic losses that are incurred when hundreds of thousands of people cannot make it to work for a few days, and when thousands of businesses are forced to remain shut because of flooding. It is exponential when compared to the losses we calculate. The cost of our inaction against climate change will only increase unless we first learn to adapt to these emerging trends of extreme weather,” said Dr Anjal Prakash, research director at the Indian School of Business (ISB), and a lead author of the ongoing 6th Assessment Report of IPCC (where he is involved in the chapter on cities, settlements and key infrastructure).",flood,Maharashtra Floods,"Maharashtra, India",2020-07-22,2020-08-05,"['Vidarbha', 'Konkan']","['100 mm', '200 mm']","['₹5,500 crore', '₹13,000 crore']","['100', '200']","['agricultural damage', 'infrastructure damage', 'economic losses']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Anish Yadav was sleeping in his home, a fragile hut made of wood and plastic, when the water rushed in.

A concrete retaining wall that had previously held back monsoon floodwaters had collapsed, sending a deluge through Yadav’s slum in Malad, a northern suburb in India’s financial hub Mumbai.

“We woke up to people screaming for help,” said Yadav, 26, of that night in July 2019. “The water had risen to our heads … and I saw people being swept away with the water with my own eyes.”

For his entire life, the wall had protected Yadav and his neighbors from increasingly severe monsoon storms. His house had never been damaged before – but with the wall now gone, he has had to rebuild his home four times in three years.

Every year, thousands of people die in India from flooding and landslides during the monsoon season, which drenches the country from June to September.

The monsoon is a natural weather phenomenon caused by warm, moist air moving across the Indian Ocean toward South Asia as the seasons change. But the climate crisis has caused the event to become more extreme and unpredictable.

India’s poor, like Yadav, are among the most vulnerable.

“The irony of it is that the poor of the world are actually victims of climate change,” even if they aren’t the ones who “created the problem,” said Sunita Narain, director general of the Centre for Science and Environment and veteran Indian environmentalist.

This weekend, world leaders are gathering in Glasgow for the COP26 climate talks as they seek to reduce carbon emissions and avoid a catastrophic rise in global temperatures.

Yet for millions of Indians, pledges on paper won’t save their homes. The climate crisis is already at their front door – and it’s knocking down the frame.

Four homes lost in three years

Mumbai, the country’s most populous city, boasts glittering skyscrapers and glitzy luxury hotels. It’s also a city of widespread poverty and wealth inequality, where about 65% of its 12 million residents live in shacks of tarp and tin in crowded slums.

Yadav and his mother were evacuated to a school after their home was first swept away in 2019. The flood had killed 32 people, and authorities said the slum was too dangerous to live in – but when an offer of new housing didn’t materialize, Yadav and his mother returned to the slum to rebuild.

“My house is about 10 by 15 feet and the floor is made of dirt,” Yadav said. “In that soil, we have hammered down wooden poles. We tie them together and then cover it with plastic sheets. If there is a cyclone or a strong wind, it will be uprooted entirely.”

Family members started keeping what scarce valuables they had in plastic bags, so they could evacuate quickly. But there’s only so much you can protect.

During the 2020 monsoon season, Yadav and his mother once again lost their home, clothing and precious food items to rain and flooding. It happened again in May this year, when a massive cyclone hit India’s west coast – an unusual event, since they typically strike the east coast.

Yadav said at that point, people were fed up with authorities and the constant cycle of destruction, evacuation and rebuilding. “How can we live this way?” he said.

The most recent disaster came in September, at the tail end of this year’s monsoon season, when debris from past flooding swept toward the slum.

“It was around 1:30 in the (morning) and debris started flowing down,” Yadav said. “It was raining heavily and we heard it moving.”

Residents were again evacuated to the school, where they remain to this day with little clean water or electricity and no toilets.

“We have no idea when we will go back or get another home,” Yadav said.

“(Authorities) are just saying that we will get housing in three to four days, but nothing is being done. People have lost their jobs and they don’t have money for food. The system is to blame here.”

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Mumbai’s governing body, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Places are becoming unlivable

As the climate crisis worsens, floods pose a particular danger to the 35% of India’s population – roughly 472 million people – who live in urban slums, according to the World Bank.

Muralee Thummarukudy, acting head of the UN Environment Program’s Resilience to Disasters and Conflicts Global Support Branch, said slum dwellers tend to live in flimsy structures on the outskirts of cities where land is less stable and more exposed to natural disasters. They also often don’t have any kind of insurance that allows them to rebuild or relocate.

These residents are also more vulnerable to the secondary effects of flooding, including the spread of waterborne diseases, groundwater contamination, and the loss of food supplies.

Rajan Samuel, managing director in India for Habitat for Humanity, says disasters wipe out livelihoods as well as homes.

“The trend I am seeing is that livelihood gets disrupted with every disaster, and then there is shelter which goes as well,” he said. “We need to mitigate both.”

Some states have taken action – like Odisha, which built stormwater drains in its slums, or Kerala, which offers financial incentives for residents in climate-vulnerable places to relocate.

Yet on a national level, progress has been slow. Several ambitious initiatives to improve slums and retrofit cities have flailed over the past two decades, stymied by a lack of funding, insufficient participation, poor planning or the red tape of Indian bureaucracy, according to a number of international organizations, researchers and local media.

And though the government is now training cities across India to become “climate smart,” experts say there are many other measures that need to be taken – like improving evacuation processes and redesigning water systems and other urban infrastructure.

Narain, from the Centre for Science and Environment, said existing systems were built “at a time when disasters were still once in 10 years, once in five years. Now, it is 10 disasters a year.”

Recent floods, droughts and other devastating climate events are “all showing us very clearly what will the future be,” she added.

Climate migrants

For years, climate experts and scientists have warned the climate crisis could displace more than a billion people in the coming decades – potentially forming a class of “climate migrants” and refugees. Flooding is one of the major dangers, with record rainfall causing devastation in Germany and China this summer.

In India, people are already on the move.

Natural disasters forced more than 5 million Indians to leave their homes in 2019, according to a study conducted by the Sydney-based Institute for Economics and Peace. And that number is expected to rise as the climate crisis worsens.

Many of those displaced Indians, like Yadav, have no means to relocate and no choice but to continually rebuild their homes in disaster-prone locations.

Yadav and his family are reluctant to move from their patch of land in the slum, unless the government provides an alternative.

He and his mother are now surviving off their meager savings, money borrowed from relatives, and cash earned from pawning their jewelry.

Right now, he’s losing hope and dreading the thought of having to rebuild – yet again.

“It has been going on for so long,” Yadav said. “You never know if the water will flood the house and destroy the house.”",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Sources said that the policy — which is prepared for rural areas — proposes to give an option of relocation to safer areas or opting for compensation for land and transfer of the land to the government.

An official said that the policy proposes that the District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMA) will identify the dangerously placed areas and prepare a list of people for relocation to safer location.

“The location may be finalised by holding discussion with the people. If the people accept the move to safer locations, their existing structures or land will be transferred to the government’s name and the government will provide them alternate accommodation and basic amenities. In case some people want to sell their land, then the government will buy it as per land acquisition norms, but they won’t be able to avail of benefits of alternate accommodation,” said an official.

After the floods and landslides in July, Thackeray had directed that a comprehensive and permanent policy be formulated for citizens in landslide-prone areas as well as those living within the blue line, which is marked considering maximum flood discharge in 25 years. Last month, the state cabinet set aside Rs 7,000 crore for long-term flood mitigation measures.

The official said that after identification of the dangerously placed areas by DDMAs, a technical committee will go through it for approval and then the government will give final approval to it.

Another official said that the people who will be relocated or can opt for selling their structures to the government must have legal structures or they can be regularised under the existing norms. Those opting for selling their structures will get compensation that is five times its value, said the official.

The official also said that this is to ensure that all the people falling in the dangerously placed areas will get relocated. “Also, the land will be with the government, which can be then used for forestry as it cannot be put to use for habitation,” said the official.

The official added that the rehabilitation policy would be finalized soon and then it may be placed before the state cabinet for approval.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

""The cabinet has cleared a proposal to provide immediate relief to flood-affected people. The extremely heavy rainfall of the last week has caused havoc in several districts. We have started providing relief as per the National Disaster Response Fund norms,"" said PWD minister Eknath Shinde.

Among other things, affected families are also being given utensils of daily use, he told reporters.

“The state government will give ₹10,000 immediately to the affected people. More aid will be given after we receive funds from the Union government,” he said.

The cabinet also decided to pay ₹50 lakh to the kin of the employees of smaller municipal councils who died due to COVID-19, Shinde said.

Aditi Tatkare, who is guardian minister of Raigad, informed that a permanent camp of the National Disaster Response Force would be set up at Mahad in the coastal district where nearly 100 people lost their lives in landslides and other rain-related incidents.

“If an NDRF camp can not be set up -- because the proposal has to be cleared by the Union government -- we will set up a camp of the State Disaster Response Force. Land has been identified for it,” she said. Such a camp can cater to the coastal Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts, Tatkare added.

The state cabinet also cleared a proposal for the implementation of ₹4,601 crore Swacch Bharat Abhiyan. It will continue till 2025 with the state bearing its share of ₹1,840.40 crore, said an official statement.

Almost 80 per cent of the southern tip, including Nariman Point and Mantralaya, Maharashtra’s seat of power, will be under water by that time. This is an area that houses banks, as well as the offices of foreign consulates, corporate houses and political parties. The iconic Wankhede Stadium, Marine Drive and National Centre for the Performing Arts are situated in this area only. This is mainly manmade land, reclaimed from the Arabian Sea in the 1970s. “If we don’t wake up [to the dangers of climate change], it will be a dangerous situation for the next 25 years,” Chahal said. “The [consequences of climate change] like melting glaciers [and rising sea levels] has come to our doorstep.”

Climate scientists have warned that most of south Mumbai, including Cuffe Parade, Mantralaya, Churchgate, Nariman Point, Umarkhadi, Mohammad Ali Road, Marine Lines, Girgaum, and Breach Candy will face the worst of the flooding by 2050. McKinsey India had released a report in February 2020 issuing a warning on the dangers Mumbai has been facing. The report stated that by 2050, Mumbai will see 25 per cent increase in the intensity of flash floods and a 0.5 metre rise in the sea level. That will affect 2-3 million people living within 1 km radius of the coastline.

Visible signs

The World Resource Institute (WRI) India has identified some worrying trends while assessing Mumbai’s vulnerability to climate change—Mumbai is becoming warmer and has seen a substantial increase in extreme rainfall events over the past few years. Since 2007, temperatures have been rising steadily. A substantial increase in heavy rainfall as well as storm events has also been noticed since then.

The data with WRI states that the number of days in which Mumbai faces situations requiring extreme caution has been increasing. These are defined as per the guidelines by National Weather Service, US—a ‘caution day’ is one in which the temperature is between 26-32oC. When it varies between 32-43oC the situation is considered as an extreme caution day. Mumbai sees 174 caution days and 187 extreme caution days per year.

Mumbai has been witnessed two to three days of extreme rainfall during the monsoon in the past couple of years. A major impact of climate change was felt on August 5, when most of south Mumbai was submerged in up to five feet of water due to heavy rain. This year, 70 per cent of the city’s average rainfall in July was received in just four days—from July 17 to 20. On July 16 and 18, Mumbai recorded over 235 mm and 253 mm of rainfall respectively within a few hours leading to flooding in many parts of the city.

Experts warning

According to a study by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the surface temperature of the Arabian Sea off Mumbai shore has been rising for close to five decades. Researchers at the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), which has been analysing west coast cyclone landfall data available since 1891, second the IPCC’s view. Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist with IITM, says the Arabian Sea’s surface temperature increased by 1.2-1.4oC between 1982 and 2018—the fastest among tropical oceans. Climate scientist Hiroyuki Murakami, who has studied the Arabian Sea over the past decade, says around 65 per cent of the recent cyclones are linked to climate change.

An IPCC report released on August 9 warns that global temperatures may rise by 1.5oC in the next two decades because of climate change. This means a rise in sea levels from the melting Antarctic ice sheets. The report says rising sea levels may inundate low-lying areas along India’s vast 7,516 km coastline, threatening cities like Mumbai, Surat, Kochi, Chennai and Visakhapatnam.

Action plan

The BMC has warned that areas like Worli, Dadar, Kurla and Andheri are more prone to extreme rainfall. The civic body has started to prepare an action plan to deal with the climate change. The first kind of experiment is expected to be complete by November this year.

The plan will focus on climate resilience with mitigation and adaptation strategies by focusing on six areas—sustainable waste management, urban greening and biodiversity, urban flooding and water resource management, building energy efficiency, air quality and sustainable mobility. The BMC is also creating a climate profile of the city with vulnerability assessment due to climate change and greenhouse gas inventory.

As the climate change is mainly attributed to loss of green cover and housing density the BMC is also planning to increase the green cover in the city. On September 1, the Maharashtra government also decided to form a state level climate change committee under Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to deal with the challenges. The committee will suggest measures based on five points—reducing, refusing, reusing, recycling and recovering.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The BMC, working with not-for-profit environmental groups, World Resources Institute (WRI) India and Waatavaran solicited inputs from experts on key aspects of urban development: waste, energy and buildings, urban flooding and water, air pollution and urban greening. With these inputs, and in consultation with the C40 network of sustainable cities, the city has charged WRI to help it draft a climate action plan. The draft of the plan should be ready in a month, for another round of public feedback.

The plan’s success will depend not only on its expansive vision but also on how well it would serve as an instrument of coordination across different urban bureaucracies and sectors. The process will also need to be broad-based and consultative to ensure the plan will address vulnerabilities of the marginalized. And if it seeks to reduce flooding, it requires nothing less than a complete reimagination of the relation between land and water in the city.

Not an island but an estuary

In their pioneering work from 2009, Soak: Rethinking Mumbai in an Estuary, Anuradha Mathur and Dilip Da Cunha have identified the city’s hostile relationship to its different waters as a prime reason for much of the flooding in the city. They call for the city to move from urban planning projects that exacerbate the city’s adversarial relationship with its rains and sea, towards practices that recognise and accommodate water. The city, they remind us, is not built on seven islands. The city is placed in an estuary.

For the last 300 years, the city has been made solid and dry through relentless projects of land filling. The floods that have regularly visited the city from its earliest days are a direct consequence of this land-making. Rain and tidal waters simply return every year to occupy the same grounds that were once khadi (wetlands), creek, or talab (pond).

As a result, the city’s residents have long been accustomed to living with regular floods. With the intensification of the rains, the increase of cyclones and the rise in sea levels however, flooding is now more severe, more frequent and more widespread. It now occurs in parts of the city that never used to flood. The city’s near future depends on how it plans for and adapts to the persistent and increasing presence of water in the city.

Inhabited Sea is a transdisciplinary, collaborative research project that I was involved with, sought to produce new imaginations of how we may live in cities with water. Started in 2019, the project brought together natural and social science researchers, architects, designers and artists in the United States and in India, to study what it might mean to design Mumbai amidst two gradients of wetness, the sea and the monsoon.

From this research, we find that if Mumbai’s Climate Action Plan proceeds as planning traditionally has in the city, the floods will only get worse. This is because of important blind spots in traditional urban planning processes.

Cities Partitioned and Dried

First, urban plans are siloed and solid. They are narrow, top-down initiatives that divide up urban life into discrete parts of urban space, each addressed in different sections of the plan and in city bureaucracies.

In Mumbai, for instance, storm water drains, sewage and roads are all managed by different departments in the city. Yet, Rhea Shah in her Inhabited Sea project, Drawing on Wetness, found, waters are always mixing: nalas hold sewage, rivers hold storm waters, the sea enters rivers and wetlands, and leaking pipes recharge aquifers.

While conventional planning and even Mumbai’s climate planning process treats these as distinct, they need to recognise that different waters (drinking, rain, sewage and sea) are part of a single interconnected urban waterscape. Accordingly, planning processes like the MCAP need to integrate landscape architecture perspectives that consider the relations of different waters, air and land use systemically, and not as different sectors.

Second, urban planning assumes that the city can be dried. Yet Mumbai is always wet — with the tides, wetlands, humidity, creeks, wells and rain. Rather than dealing with the impossibility of dewatering the city, planners need to see and support existing infrastructures that effectively hold water for some part of every day, month or year. Fortunately, the city still has a wealth of natural infrastructures — creeks, wetlands, nalas, and talabs — which provide considerable service to the city. Even at the MCAP climate consultations, the WRI quantified the significant economic benefit of mangroves that reduce the risks and costs of flooding, hold excess water during rain events, and also pull carbon out of the atmosphere. They are a mitigation as well as an adaptation infrastructure for the city.

Yet, because the value of natural infrastructures is neither recognised nor calculated in urban planning or development processes, their loss is assumed to not cost the city. Thus, large infrastructure projects, like the coastal road or metros are proposed and constructed without studying how much the loss of trees or permeable ground will cost the city in future flooding. As Thackeray said at the launch, there has to be a climate lens for every infrastructural development. A road that floods the city cannot be called development.

Valuing natural infrastructure

Natural infrastructures need to be more accurately valued when making development decisions. To some extent, this is happening with mangroves. But the rate fixed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2009 is a gross underestimate of the ecosystem services provided by mangroves. The value assigned, at approximately ₹10 lakh per hectare, does not even cover the cost of land in Mumbai! The compensation for natural infrastructure loss, like mangrove habitat loss, needs to incorporate both the costs of land and the environmental services provided. Similarly rates, possibly payable to the city environment department, should be fixed for other natural infrastructures such as wetlands, intertidal regions and creeks and river floodplains, whose benefits — carbon sequestration, recreational spaces, flood adaptation and infrastructure — make the city a suitable place to live.

Natural infrastructures are generally more cost effective (they are free) and can better complement costly engineering solutions such as storm water drains and water retention tanks. Natural infrastructures are also more spatially efficient. They are often valuable commons that are used by many of the city’s more marginalized populations for work.

As such, the Mumbai adaptation plan needs to recognise and support multiply-used urban commons that serve as recreation areas, permeable water holding infrastructures and carbon mitigation spaces at different times of year. This is especially critical for a congested city like Mumbai.

Maintaining water infrastructure

Since the 1920s, when the city constructed the massive Tansa dam, it has been found that adding new supply does not solve Mumbai’s water problems. Instead, new source development constructs new problems. New dams caused deforestation and the displacement of adivasis in Thane district, Bharat Kaushal Punjabi pointed out in his 2015 thesis on the politics of water contestation in Mumbai-Thane region. New desalination plants consume lots of energy, raise sea temperatures and pollute water, causing harm to marine biodiversity. Neither deforestation and displacement, nor pollution and energy use are in line with Mumbai’s mitigation and adaptation goals.

The city also has underground water sources it is not adequately using. For a long time, we have heard that Mumbai’s ground water is contaminated and cannot be used. Yet, many residents of the city are already using well water, obtained through its private water tanker network. Can these resources be made available for the public? Following a year of low rainfall in 2009, the BMC found, renovated, and used water from 12,531 wells in the city in one month alone. With adequate maintenance, Mumbai’s wells can continue to hydrate the city. Necessary policy changes can make everyday water insecurity and vulnerability, particularly for Mumbai’s informal residents, a thing of the past.

The MCAP assessment on flooding and water resources points to the need to augment water sources in the city through desalination plants. This activity is fraught for all sorts of reasons, not least because new sources are totally unnecessary. As I show in my book, Hydraulic City: Water and the Infrastructures of Politics in Mumbai (2017), there is no water scarcity in city. All of the data points to the fact that the city receives enough water from its sources. The problem has to do with the significant inefficiencies of water distribution and leakages. According to one BMC report in 2009, these account for approximately 30% of water “lost” in the city.

A new paradigm

Following the catastrophic floods of July 26, 2005 the Chitale Committee Report pointed out that the rain event was an exceedingly rare, one-in-a-hundred-year event and that expanding the city’s existing storm water infrastructure was necessary. Together with other interventions in the city, these would ensure that the network would work during normal times. But normal times are a thing of the past now. The extremely heavy rainfall of July 2005 has happened several times since, including this year. Rainfall intensity no longer meets our historical expectations. The city of Houston, for example experienced three one-in-500 year flood events in the span of just two years!

As such fforts to manage the city’s rains in the present and future, based on 100-year-old technologies will always come up short, and more so because we are living in climate changed times. Storm water engineers working at MCGM confess that the storm water improvements made in the last 10 years are already insufficient for the new normal. City officials cannot expect to drain the seas, intense rains and storms of the present and near future through conventional technologies. With new water and landscape approaches, however, they can find ways for all the city’s residents to live better with water.

Some of these cars make their way to the numerous mechanics in Taloja who work specifically on flood affected cars.

Thanks to the Team-BHP fan (he prefers to remain anonymous) who sent this information in. Heartfelt gratitude for sharing them with other enthusiasts via this Team-BHP share page!

I am writing this mail to make people aware of some shady practices going on with flood affected cars in and around Mumbai Metropolitan Region.

As most parts of Navi Mumbai, Kalyan, Thane, Shil Phata, and Panvel were affected by floods this year, there has been a multifold increase in the number of flood affected cars. I recently found out that the majority of these cars end up in Taloja for the following two jobs:

Repair Transport to other cities without repair (Tier II and III)

In the first week of August 2021, there were more than 100 flood affected cars parked near Taloja Station being loaded onto container trucks very carefully for being transported to other cities. A colleague of mine interacted with a garage near my home, which undertakes jobs of flood affected cars only. He found out the following details of this business.

A huge number of cars comes to Taloja within 7 days to 15 days of a flood. These cars are bought from different locations and kept along the old Mumbai-Pune highway near Taloja Gaon, opposite the RAF camp, near Taloja Railway Station. Some of these cars make their way to the numerous mechanics in Taloja who work specifically on flood affected cars.

As per the garage owner, these cars are of the following ownerships:

Individual owner gets the car to these garages for repair and then either takes it back or sells it. Generally, these cars have their number plates on them. Flood affected cars are procured by local dealers and online used car sites, repaired and sold to an unsuspecting client either locally or even online! Here comes the shady part. These cars bought to Taloja have their number plates removed in order to protect their identity i.e. photos going online suggesting that these cars were flood affected. Cars procured by local dealers from insurance companies, which were declared a total loss. Again, these cars have their number plates removed and are repaired.

Even the garage owner doesn't know the method of registration of the cars in the names of the further 2nd / 3rd owners as they have been declared a total loss. As far as I know, total loss cars are generally de-registered. Are some heavy under-the-table dealings happening at registration offices? But here we are, these cars will be sold to unsuspecting buyers. Most of these cars are sent to other cities for sale.

This garage had cars bought in from as far as Pen and Chiplun. I myself saw a fairly new Creta and an Altroz apart from 13 other cars.

BTW, the workmanship at this garage was absolutely ridiculous. Three boys were jumping on the Creta's rear seat after it was removed and bought out in the open, in order to drain the excess water from it. Electrical parts' repairs are just jugaad. Engine repairs are completely unprofessional. I felt horrible just looking at these cars. What happens to all those sensors in these modern cars? One-by-one they will malfunction over a short period of time - pity the unsuspecting owners.

I have learnt that with such jobs, these garages make a fortune to such an extent that they do not even entertain cars for regular service and maintenance.

Add to this, there is a huge stockyard of two major online used car businesses near these garages in Taloja and right now, they have at least 100 used cars in their stock combined. The nexus between these garages and these used car dealers can not be stricken off.

Witnessing this has shaken me to the core. Recently, a colleague of mine was looking forward to buying a car. I had accompanied her 3 years ago when she bought her first used car on my recommendation. This time though, I wasn't confident enough to ask her to go the used car way, as I am scared after seeing these practices.

I would suggest everyone to exercise extra caution while purchasing used cars. These cars are flooding the used car market. They may still be in a small number proportionally, but you never know when you'll fall prey to such practices.

Here are some pictures taken by me.

This Creta was not bearing a number plate right from the day it was brought to this garage:

Same is the case with this Altroz:

But now, it is synonymous with another Chennai image: Roads that turn into rivers, boats for vehicles, and people stranded in homes at the first hint of heavy rainfall.

When Chennai received over 900mm excess rainfall in November, the roads of T Nagar, and indeed other parts of Chennai, were completely submerged. It was the second highest rainfall recorded in the city in November since 2015, when it suffered massive floods.

In November 2015, Chennai received 1,049mm of rain, compared with 915mm of rainfall till November 29 this year. There have been particularly heavy rains between November 6 and 7 (210 mm), November 10 (22mm), November 19 (32mm), and November 26 (29mm). Overall, Tamil Nadu and the neighbouring Union territory of Puducherry together received 630mm of rainfall from October 1to November 29 as against the average for these months of 350mm. “During the same time period the rainfall received in Chennai is 1,130mm, which is 83% higher than the average,” said V Puviarasan, deputy director of the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Chennai.

Across the state, 72 people were killed in rain-related incidents, 15,164 people were evacuated from low-lying areas and accommodated in 182 relief camps, and crops spread over 50,000 hectares were damaged.

Low flood limit

In the 2015 tragedy, more than 400 people lost their lives across the state. The situation was compounded when water from the Chembarambakkam lake was released, flooding Chennai. Since then, the Tamil Nadu government has said that a ₹5,000 crore integrated stormwater project is being implemented, and in T Nagar alone, ₹9.3 crore has been spent on a drain under the “smart city” mission, and was completed in 2020.

This expenditure includes work to construct collector, feeder and arterial drains, canals for the Adyar and Cooum basins, which were completed last year, and ongoing work for canals for the Kosasthalaiyar basin in northern Chennai and Kovalam in the south. And yet, Chennai floods.

The first reason is Chennai’s long history of vanishing lakes and water bodies, captured by rampant and unfettered urbanisation. Only 15% of Chennai’s wetlands are left, according to a study by Chennai-based Care Earth Trust, a biodiversity research organisation. Their findings show that Chennai’s built-up area grew from 47 sq. km in 1980 to 402 sq. km in 2012, while wetlands declined from 186 sq. km to 71 sq. km.

Between 2017 and 2018, about 48km of drains were built under the smart cities mission. Wherever these new drains have been laid, there was little to no flooding, said an official of Greater Chennai Corporation. “Places like T Nagar flood all the time mostly because there are old drains, which we are looking to reconstruct,” he said, requesting anonymity.

In T Nagar, particularly, there was another problem. Contractors engaged in improvement work for the Mambalam canal, where all the water from T Nagar drains, had dumped debris all along a length of 1.7km that blocked inlets.

An indication that the drains in the city failed to work during this monsoon comes from the overburdening of another department, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, which manages the city’s water supply and sewage network.

“We usually pump out 585 mld (million litres per daily) of sewage everyday, which reaches the treatment plants, but since heavy rains began, we are pumping out 920 mld,” an official from the department said, but declined to be named. “The additional load is because the corporation is using heavy motors to drain rainwater from waterlogged streets into the sewerage pipes.”

“We also stop our system for about four to five hours every night for maintenance,” he said. “But this entire month, the pumping system and treatment plants have been functioning 24x7.”

According to municipality records, there are more than 30,000 interior roads and 471 bus route roads in Chennai that add up to close to 5,000km and 300km, respectively, but the city’s drainage network is present in just around 2,000km. Many of these drains were built at least three decades ago.

“The old drains were constructed for a rainfall capacity of 20mm per hour, whereas the new drains are being built for 70mm per hour. The old drains are built of brick and mortar so they are dilapidated and break easily,” said the municipality official cited above said.

“They don’t have the capacity to withstand the kind of rains we have received this year,” he said. “We have been using reinforced concrete for the new drains since 2015.”

Many areas in the city were flooded although they had roads with drains on both sides, found a field audit by Chennai-based Arappor Iyakkam, an anti-corruption NGO.

“Why are they spending crores of money to build these drains which aren’t working? They may as well spend less to buy pumps to drain water via sewage pipes, which is what they have been doing every monsoon,” said Jayaram Venkatesan, convener of Arappor Iyakkam.

Corruption in awarding tenders as well as improper design where the drain slope is higher than the height of the road or the gradient not matching the water body to which it is linked are primary problems, Venkatesan said.

After years of demands by activists and environmentalists, the municipal corporation his week began releasing maps on its website on where drains are located, a crucial information gap till now. “Only with these maps will we be able to understand where the drains are present, how they are connected and in which direction they drain,” said Venkatesan.

These maps show, for instance, a ward in T Nagar where the height of a manhole on the street is at 5m but the drain is at a height of 5.7m, impeding the flow of water, said Raj Bhagat, senior manager of Geoanalytics at research organisation World Resources Institute India, who is studying these maps.

There has also been no way of verifying if these drains have been designed in tune with the rate of rainfall, he said. “Even if the drain is designed for a particular rainfall rate, it is connected to another drain so the second drain has to have more capacity as well because it accumulates water from both streets,” Bhagat said.

The city’s drainage network is designed only to carry average rainfall, and that it cannot handle excess rainfall, according to KP Subramanian, former professor of urban engineering at Chennai’s Anna University. “And it gets clogged further with solid waste and drain slits that are not cleaned regularly.”

There is also a clear lack of coordination between various civic departments ranging from the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, which approves building constructions, the public works department that is in charge of de-silting water bodies, the municipal corporation which builds drains and Metro Water that lays pipelines under roads for water and sewage connections.

“We have a common problem where the corporation lays a new bitumen road and almost immediately it is dug up by other state agencies such as the Metro Water, electricity board, telephone and internet providers to lay utility cables underground,” a government official said on condition of anonymity. “Similarly, in some places, Metro Water pipelines run perpendicular to the drains underground, which reduces the capacity of the drains.”

Moving forward

Based on the November rains, municipal authorities have identified pockets where drainage capacity has to be augmented, said GCC commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi, who took over the civic body in May.

He also said drain construction will now follow prescribed standards. “The World Bank’s standard, for example, is for bigger drains to take 70mm of rainfall per hour. But if we receive 100mm rainfall and that has to be taken care of, the stormwater drains will be bigger and the roads will become smaller,” Bedi said. “Drains are constructed for optimum rainfall and not heavy rainfall because there has to be a balance between the road width and the drain.”

Given this tenuous balance, Bedi said the corporation was looking at ways to bolster drainage even if there is stagnant water, like permanent pumps. “We are looking at how fast we can drain out the water even if it stagnates. As the city expands, many drains’ capacity has to be increased. And it’s not just the case in Chennai. It is the same for Bengaluru or Mumbai,” he said.

Another peculiar issue that GCC engineers identified during these rains were so-called saucer-type streets, where the constant relaying of roads resulted in them being at a higher level than homes in densely populated areas. “You can’t put up drains in these places so we have decided to have permanent pumps there too,” said Bedi.

Ironically, another conundrum that the city faces is a drought-like situation a few months after the northeast monsoon, which experts say can be addressed if the urban run-off is stored. Water from drains should be diverted to existing water bodies, particularly those located outside Chennai, which will help in mitigating flooding as well as recharging aquifers, experts said.

“We thought they would learn lessons from the 2015 floods, but they haven’t,” said Sekhar Raghavan, director of the city based Rain Centre, a non-profit. “You cannot build a stormwater drain over a lake or a pond and let that water go into the sea. Drains work only in specific locations.”

“The government needs to look into the potential of water bodies, protect, reclaim and rejuvenate them,” Raghavan said. “This will rescue flooding and, if these water bodies can be made into recharge ponds and reservoirs, the local community can use it for their water needs.”

All said, the city will continue to flood, former corporation officials said. “It’s a complex issue. One, we have geographical disadvantages of being a flat city close to sea level. And since for more than 70 years, we have encroached on all the natural water bodies,” a former official said, asking not to be named. “It’s a collective failure of officials, real estate and civil society.”

Vishawas Patil, chairman, Kolhapur Zilla Sahakari Dudh Utpadak Sangh Limited, which owns Gokul, said they have decided not to supply to Mumbai, which is the largest market for the brand. “The [milk] collection has largely been affected on Thursday and Friday due to downpour in Western Maharashtra and Konkan. Against the daily collection of 1.3 million liters, we could collect about 250,000 liters on Friday. It dropped by 76,000 on Thursday,” he said and added that “many highways heading to Mumbai are shut as heavy rainfall continued on Friday as well.

Patil said milk supply to the Mumbai market will resume as soon as possible.

In the past 24 hours ending Saturday morning, Kolhapur received 181mm of rainfall while Satara recorded 172mm.

“Both of these places broke the all-time record of highest 24hrs rain in July. Pune, too, with 80mm rainfall has received the highest 24hrs rainfall after 2014,” said Vineet Kumar, Researcher at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune.

An official from the Kolhapur district disaster management cell said the Panchganga river’s water level is currently at 55 feet at the Rajaram weir. A total of 114 bunds have gone under water, he added.

District administration said on Thursday as many as 47 villages in Kolhapur were cut off after roads were submerged due to heavy rains and 965 families were shifted to safer places. Two persons, including a woman, were also swept away at different places in the district during the downpour.

In Sangli as many as 36,000 people were evacuated after Krishna river touched the danger mark of 45-feet at Irwin bridge.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
131,131,mumbai,2021,https://india.mongabay.com/2021/11/freely-available-geospatial-dataset-to-make-flood-research-easier/,16 Nov 2021,Freely-available geospatial dataset to make flood research easier,"India’s first digital flood inventory has digitised flooding events from 1985 to 2016 using data from the India Meteorological Department.

The digital inventory will aid future data collection efforts, scientific research on floods, disaster risk reduction, loss and damage estimates and pave the way to develop financial products to tackle disaster risks.

Stakeholders working to build financial products and mechanisms such as disaster risk insurances including crop insurances could also benefit from the dataset.

Data on fatalities and damage associated with India’s flooding events from 1985 to 2016 have been meticulously mined from printed government records and combined with information from global databases to create India’s first digital flood inventory freely available in modern geospatial formats.

The India Flood Inventory (IFI) pools 89% of its data from the India Meteorological Department’s Disastrous Weather Events, and the remaining from Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO), states the paper documenting the inventory’s inception.

“We have taken decades of data from the published document by IMD’s DWE, digitised it, fixed a lot of things, and augmented it with geospatial information in the form of GIS files. Each historical flooding event now has its information digitised, which IMD didn’t have till now,” said Manabendra Saharia from IIT-Delhi’s Hydrosense Lab, who led the development of the inventory.

The objective was to provide a ready-made database to the community that could be used for future work including disaster management personnel and scientists working on flood research and management. The inventory will also aid future data collection efforts.

Floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters. India is one of the most affected countries with the increasing frequency and intensity of floods, leading to loss of lives and livelihoods. The latest assessment report from IPCC’s Working Group 1, finds that climate change is intensifying the water cycle which will bring more rainfall and associated flooding in some regions. In-depth research and better early warning systems (EWS) are needed for India to adapt to such disasters. The most important component for carrying on with in depth research and EWS is data.

Data to help with attribution, modeling and forecast

“If a disaster management personnel looks at the dataset, they would have a searchable archive of every flooding event as recorded by IMD. While IMD will admit there are observational deficiencies in the collection, this is the best possible available historical information which helps personnel to assess how many people have died in historical flooding events, or how much paddy has been destroyed to plan for food shortages etc. and for which months,” said Saharia.

The scientists marked every event with a Unique Event Identifier making it easy to reference with other datasets through a common database scheme; dates were made compliant to ISO 8601, an internationally accepted calendar-and-clock format. Information on human fatalities, animal fatalities, damages etc. was extracted from the dataset and coordinates of the events were verified.

India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientist D.S. Pai, the co-author of the paper, shares that the inventoried data would help with attribution analysis, improve modeling and forecast. “Improved modeling and flood forecasting would help strengthen our flood early warning systems,” the Pune-based Pai, Head, Climate Research & Services, IMD, Ministry of Earth Sciences told Mongabay-India. “The data would also aid with hazard mapping and vulnerability analysis,” he said.

“Analysis of the data in the inventory highlights that the majority of floods in the country happen in the monsoon season, which is 79% of the yearly total, with a peak in July. While the number of flood fatalities during the same period is 83% of the yearly total, with a peak in August,” the paper states.

Large flood plains such as Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Maharashtra, Bihar, and West Bengal experience the highest number of floods and fatalities. While, the hill states such as Uttarakhand have experienced catastrophic events, with some of the highest per-capita death rates in the country.

The inventory reveals three major flood events: the Brahmaputra floods in 1988 and 2004 and the 1987 Bihar floods that affected the entire state.

Sushma Guleria, assistant professor at the National Institute of Disaster Management, who was not associated with the inventory work, explained that historical data of flooding events also come in handy to implement post-disaster needs assessment (PDNA) contributing to the collection and standardisation of loss and damage data in the aftermath of floods. “Having access to historical data would also help to track the intangible damages such as displacement, property damage, impacts on ecosystems and psychological effects of loss of life, that can be long-lasting and earmark adequate compensation for flood-affected families factoring in the tangible and intangible impacts,” Guleria told Mongabay-India.

Saharia adds that it could also benefit stakeholders working to build financial products and mechanism such as disaster risk insurances including crop insurances.

Loss and damage due to climate disasters and slow onset events like sea-level rise and climate finance to address loss and damage and decarbonisation efforts by developing countries were important issues for these countries at the recently concluded United Nations climate conference in Glasgow or COP26.

The United Nations weather agency World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in its report State of the Climate in Asia 2020 said India lost USD87 billion in 2020 due to cyclones, floods and droughts. Floods and cyclones contribute to maximum human deaths in India from extreme weather events (EWEs) in the past 50 years.

At COP26 which saw India pledge to net zero commitments by 2070, the nation also stood its ground demanding climate finance to act on its climate commitments. The richest one percent of the world’s population is responsible for more than twice the combined share of carbon emissions of the poorest 50 percent.

Temperatures are rising, glaciers are melting and quite a few cities may be underwater soon. And it’s not getting better - even in the most optimistic scenario, where global greenhouse gas emissions begin to decline right now and are slashed to net-zero by 2050, global temperature will still peak above the 1.5-degree threshold before falling.

Cycles of floods caused by heavy bursts of rainfall and a rise in droughts due to increased evaporation, is potentially what India’s climate future will look like as the world barrels towards breaching the 1.5 degree Celsius ceiling for global warming by 2040, a UN report has said.

Already, India’s financial capital Mumbai is witness to heavy rainfall days unprecedented in decades that last month left the city flooded and also extracted its toll in human lives.

On the other side, in West Bengal, following unprecedented devastation after two cyclones, Cyclone Amphan and Cyclone Yaas, residents of two islands in the Sundarbans — Ghoramara and Mousuni —were moved away to safety by the West Bengal government as tidal waters and rainfall pose grave risk to their lives while much of their property has already been claimed by the sea in July 2021. Man and animal have cohabited these islands, but climate change has out a question mark on the existence of Sundarbans itself, which incidentally also features on the Unesco World Heritage List.

According to a climate threat assessment report released by the Centre last year, the Bay of Bengal area where the Sundarbans lies is one of the most climatically vulnerable zones in India with an increase in sea levels and flooding presenting the greatest risk. An analysis of data between 1891 and 2018 showed that the Bay of Bengal region was struck by 41 severe cyclonic storms and 21 cyclonic storms during the given period. All these events had occurred in the month of May.

A new study from Climate Central, a nonprofit research group, shows that roughly 50 major coastal cities will have to immediately start “unprecedented"" adaptation measures to prevent rising seas from swallowing them. On its new Coastal Risk Screening Tool, where the projections show which cities are at risk to be below sea levels up to 2150, even the closest depiction of 2030 paints a dangerous picture for some Indian cities - especially in the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Kerala and West Bengal.

According to the website, the Coastal Risk Screening Tool is “an interactive map showing areas threatened by sea level rise and coastal flooding. Combining the most advanced global model of coastal elevations with the latest projections for future flood levels."" From the map itself with the marker on 2030. Here’s a look at what it looks like for the year 2030.

Here’s a closer look at the areas which will be below tide level by 2030:

This map shows how parts of Mumbai, almost the entirety of Navi Mumbai, the coastal areas of Sunderbans, and the surrounding areas of West Bengal’s capital, Kolkata, along with Cuttack in Odisha, may be below tide-level in 2030. 2030 is in just 9 years from now — and the future is imminent if sea-levels don’t stop rising. For Kerala too, the area surrounding Kochi and other coastal cities, the threat of being below tide-level is drastically high according to the map data.

For the year 2120, almost a hundred years from now, the situation looks even worse, with almost every coastal surrounding cities of India marked in red, and destined to be below the tide-level.

Making an ambitious pledge at the Glasgow climate summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said India will reach net-zero carbon emission by 2070. While delivering the national address as a ‘representative’ of developing nations, PM Modi outlined a five-point plan or ‘Panchamrit’ to fight the devastating effects of global warming and climate change.

‘Net zero’ emission refers to a scenario where the amount of greenhouse gases produced is the same as the amount removed from the atmosphere, by employing strategies like the planting of trees and deploying advanced technologies to capture carbon dioxide. China has said it would reach that goal in 2060, and the US and the EU aim for 2050.",issue,Mumbai Floods 2021,"Mumbai, India",July 2021,July 2021,"['Mumbai', 'Navi Mumbai', 'Sundarbans', 'Kolkata', 'Cuttack']",Unprecedented in decades,Unknown,Unknown,Unprecedented devastation,The floods were caused by heavy rainfall and a rise in sea levels.

Chiplun, Maharashtra, India – At least 209 people are confirmed dead due to floods caused by the heavy monsoon rainfall since July 22 in the western Indian state of Maharashtra.

Ratnagiri and Raigad, the two coastal districts in the state’s Konkan region, were the worst hit, reporting 130 of the total deaths in floods and landslides.

Ratnagiri’s Chiplun and Raigad’s Mahad bore the maximum brunt of the disaster, forcing Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to visit the two towns on Sunday.

“We are standing with you to ensure you get back up on your feet,” assured CM Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray while comforting the traders and shopkeepers in the Chiplun market. pic.twitter.com/rr6Mnn08Aq — CMO Maharashtra (@CMOMaharashtra) July 25, 2021

The floods are reminiscent of a similar catastrophe that hit the region in 2005, killing more than 1,000 people, including nearly 500 in Mumbai, India’s financial capital, alone.

But residents in Chiplun, home to about 150,000 people, say the tragedy this year was worse.

“The 2021 floods were 10 times deadlier than the 2005 floods,” 58-year-old Vrunda Gandhi from Chiplun’s Peth-Maap area told Al Jazeera.

Chiplun is located at the foothills of the Sahyadri mountain range in the Konkan region, with two sides of the town surrounded by Vashishthi and Shiv rivers.

The Arabian Sea is barely 25km (15 miles) away, making the area prone to water coming in from the rivers’ tributaries as well.

Moreover, excess water from the Koyna Dam, one of Maharashtra’s largest – some 90km (56 miles) away, arrives in a reservoir close to Chiplun and gets mixed with the Vashishthi River.

So, the town gets choked from all sides if there is excessive rainfall during the monsoons.

Pravin Pawar, a senior government official in Chiplun, told Al Jazeera the area received 450mm (17.7 inches) of rainfall in a single day on July 22. For comparison, the highest single-day rainfall recorded in the capital, New Delhi, in the last 15 years was 144mm (5.7 inches) in 2016.

How the floods started

The people in Chiplun went to sleep on the night of July 21 amid the relentless downpour. At about 3am the next day, WhatsApp messages started alerting people of water levels rising in the coastal town.

Vaibhav Chavan, 42, says he began warning the local municipal office at about 1.30am. He alleges no steps were taken to alert the sleeping residents.

“By 5am, water started seeping into people’s houses. It was only then that some people started waking up to find 5-6 feet [1.5-1.8 metres] of water outside their homes,” he told Al Jazeera.

“The situation turned chaotic … By the morning, there was almost 13-15 feet [4-4.6 metres] of floodwater, and the people were stuck inside their homes.”

In such a scenario, India’s National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) is usually assigned to rescue people from flooded areas.

But the residents say the NDRF did not arrive in Chiplun for more than 24 hours of flooding, while the local police could not start any rescue operation as they lacked the tools.

“We kept waiting for any help to arrive from the government, but that didn’t happen. The local boys helped my family reach a safe place,” said Gandhi, whose house is on the ground floor.

Pawar told Al Jazeera the water current was so strong that no rescue operation could have been done as the “boats were being turned because of the water flow”.

For a full day, there was no clarity on the situation as rising waters did not allow anyone to enter the town.

Reports say at least eight COVID-19 patients admitted to a private hospital in Chiplun died as a power outage shut the oxygen machines and there was no diesel available to switch on the generator.

The medical staff at the hospital allegedly ran away from the scene fearing attacks by the relatives of the patients who had died.

Residents spent the night in fear as water continued to drown the town, with some local volunteers helping the community.

Raju Vikhare, 53, said saving his and his family’s life became his only priority after a point.

“We thought we would die. When I took my family to a neighbour’s two-story house, the water was reaching my neck. As I started going back, I realised I cannot go on top of the house since I could slip easily from the roof and fall right into the floodwater,” he told Al Jazeera.

An NDRF team finally arrived at about 8am on July 23, say the residents, nearly 26 hours after the floods hit.

Since Chiplun is on the foot of the Sahyadri, the water flows downhill. So the floodwaters had gone down by the time the NDRF team arrived.

But the devastating floods have left heaps of mud that has not been cleared a week after the disaster, which destroyed dozens of houses and businesses, and made nearly 1,000 people homeless in Chiplun.

Sahil Takale, who owns an electronics store in the town, estimated his losses at $235,000.

“I lost six warehouses and one big showroom full of electronic goods. We tried walking in the floodwater to try and save some [sections] of our shop, but it was not possible at all,” he said.

Takale said the insurance of his businesses can salvage a percentage of the loss. “We are OK, but there are many small businessmen in the city who don’t buy insurance. Only God knows how they will emerge from this tragedy.”

The entire market in Chiplun looked as if it had no roads, with the entire surface turning brown due to mud.

‘Man-made disaster’

Residents say the flood in Chiplun was worsened by Koyna Dam releasing millions of gallons of water.

“We understand that the dam needs to release water, but at least make us aware and don’t surprise us like this in the middle of the night,” local politician Faisal Kaskar told Al Jazeera.

But experts find it hard to believe that only water released from the dam could cause destruction of this level.

Pankaj Dalwi, environmentalist and founder of Konkan Alert NGO, says an “unparalleled deforestation” and absence of urban planning measures were the prime reasons for the “man-made disaster”.

“There has been immense amount of earth-moving and tree-cutting for the purpose of the new Mumbai-Goa National Highway and Pune-Bijapur state highway. This deforestation led to the water bodies changing their routes and seeping into the cities,” Dalwi told Al Jazeera.

Dalwi said Chiplun used to be a wetland area, but in the past 10-15 years, there has been the construction of residential societies on those lands.

“Chiplun did not follow any urban policy guidelines and ignored the environmental impact of the constructions on these wetlands,” he said.

Pawar agreed with the claims. “We have to accept it. This is due to climate change.”",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Ganesh Redij spent two days in his flooded shop in Chiplun without food or drinking water. As rain poured, he went to his grocery shop on Wednesday to put his stock on the upper floor, but by the time he was done, water level had started increasing. He stayed back, but by next morning, he found himself in neck-deep floodwater.

Redij's shop is located in the Bazarpeth area of Chiplun, where 149 people were killed in a flood and 64 others are still missing. The floodwater started rising rapidly in the city, as Shiv and Vashishti rivers began overflowing following intense rainfall.

Speaking to mid-day about the horrifying incident, Redij said, “On Wednesday night, as it started raining, I feared water would enter my shop, so I rushed there to shift food grains and other grocery items to the upper floor. My shop is 16 feet in height, including the top floor of four feet.”

“Suddenly, rainwater started entering my shop and soon the ground floor was flooded. I realised that it was now impossible to return home, so I decided to stay back and took shelter on the upper floor. As it rained all night, water reached the upper floor by Thursday morning. By 5 am, the floodwater was till my waist and in no time, I was in neck-deep water.

Surrounded by pests

Redij said he saw rats and cockroaches in the water around him, trying to survive. “Only my face was out of water. I was feeling weak as I hadn’t eaten for the past 24 hours. I was scared and as the area was completely flooded I knew no help was coming. I started praying.”

The shop owner added that on Friday, as rain started to slow down, he thought there was still hope that he would live. “I was finally able to come out of my shop in the evening, after almost two days. All my goods had washed away, but I was saved.” Redij said that the 2005 flood had caused much less destruction. The floodwater in the area had risen by just 1.5 feet then, he added.

No insurance

Redij said he lost his goods worth around Rs 15 lakh and does not hope to get any insurance cover. During the 2005 flood, the insurance company had refused to pay for the damage, claiming it covers only theft, he added.

He said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray visited the area on Sunday to assess the loss, but the municipal corporation had cleared the roads before his visit. “Officials pretended as if there was no massive flooding and no destruction of properties.

All natural disasters, including floods extract heavy human costs. The poor live at subsistence levels and such shocks are always very harsh on them. But the prospect of greater wealth destruction during natural disasters is also worse news for the Indian economy.

A simple comparison illustrates the point. From 2008 to 2014, houses were damaged in both Bihar and Kerala every year because of floods and heavy rains. A 2018 Central Water Commission (CWC) report shows that the value lost per damaged house was almost four times in Kerala as in Bihar: ₹2,857 in Bihar and ₹10,906 in Kerala. More than the intensity of floods, this numbers reflects the fact that Kerala houses are better-built than Bihar, because the former has higher per capita income.

Richer states and non-farm sector are suffering more damage in floods now

A 2018 CWS report gives state-wise value of damages caused by floods from 1953 to 2016. Sorting these states by per capita GSDP shows that the share of the bottom one-third of states in flood related damages has reduced from more than 50% to just above one-third between 1961-2000 and 2001-2016. This means that India’s more affluent states are suffering a higher damage in floods.

Floods are now increasingly affecting the non-farm sector in India. In the 1961 to 2000 period, an average of 58% of the damage caused by floods annually was from the damage to crops while 27% was from public utilities. This pattern has now reversed. From 2001 to 2016, crop loss accounted for an average 29.7% of the damage, while public utilities accounted for 58.6% of monetary losses due to floods. What explains these two changes? Both the climate crisis and the nature of urbanisation are to blame.

Intense rainfall is increasing in districts with more affluence

While floods affect all, they seem to affect some more than others. Counterintuitive as it sounds, floods cause more monetary damage if they affect an area with a greater share of rich. This is due to the simple reason that richer dwellings have more valuable items than their poorer counterparts. A joint reading of an HT analysis of rainfall patterns and a Mint database of district-wise wealth tracker shows that India’s richer districts are becoming more vulnerable to floods now.

Mint’s wealth tracker uses the 2015-16 National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) to rank districts on the basis of assets and amenities (pucca house, electricity connection, phone, television, AC/cooler, refrigerator, washing machine, and motorized vehicle) owned by households. A household is described as affluent if it owns at least six of the eight assets listed here. HT has used the India Meteorological Department’s gridded rainfall database to look at the increase in heavy and extreme rainfall in comparison to the long period average (LPA).

The median share of the affluent in districts where heavy and extreme rainfall – when a lot of rain happens in very little time or over a very small area – has increased the most during the 2015 to 2020 period is 20.73%. This share becomes smaller as we move to districts where such rainfall has increased by lesser degrees. In districts where heavy and extreme rainfall has increased the least, the median share of the affluent was 15.4%.

It should be kept in mind that the district-wise increase in heavy/extreme rainfall is a relative measure as it is being tracked against past rainfall (1961-2010) in the same district.

Concrete jungles without drains are bound to get flooded

Almost every time Kerala faces serious floods, the Cochin airport has to suspend operations, as the runway gets flooded. This should not be surprising. Where the airport has been built, there used to be paddy fields at one point of time, where flooding was a boon rather than a bane.

A similar case is of the Santacruz airport in Mumbai built on the floodplains of the Mithi River. During heavy rains in July, Mumbai airport has had to temporarily suspend operations due to waterlogging on either the runways or tarmac in 2017 and in 2021. However, disruptions due to turbulence following heavy rainfall events are more common, recurring every year since 2017. In 2019, a passenger aircraft overshot the main runway while landing in heavy rains on July 2. The main runway remained shut for close to four days. It is common for operations to become restricted to a single runway during heavy rains. Expansion of the airport has squeezed the Mithi river into a small stream, and the construction of a second runway in 1970 created a right-angle bend in the river which has worsened flooding.

The cases of these airports are symptomatic of a larger problem with India’s changing land-use pattern. The National Statistical Office (NSO) gives remote sensing-based land-use statistics in India. Built up area increased from 118,998 square kilometres in 2011-12 to 121,848 square kilometres in 2015-16. Of the 3,609 square kilometres added from other sources, 73% came from agriculture, 5.7% from forest land, and 3.3% from grass or grazing land. These numbers capture the rapid surge in concretisation in India in the recent past. An increase in concretised area also means that rainwater does not seep into the ground. In the short-term, this means waterlogging and, in the long-term, it means a fall in replenishment rate of ground water tables.

What makes the concretisation problem even worse, at least from the point of view of flooding, is the fact that most Indian cities have built houses but not drains. A government survey carried out in 2010-11 in 104 municipal corporations/Nagar Nigams in large cities found that 56 of them had 50% roads not covered by storm water drainage. Similarly, 745 of 1,383 other urban local bodies (ULB) had less than 50% coverage, and 1,142 ULBs had less than 75% coverage. This is apart from the everyday sight of drains choked with waste or silt where they do exist.

When these problems fester in big cities, it can lead to huge losses. Mumbai’s 2005 flooding — when the city received over 900mm of rain in a single day — caused an estimated insurance loss of $0.9 billion, according to a report by Swiss Re Institute. A more recent study by the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and accounting firm KPMG, submitted to the Maharashtra government in September 2019, pegged Mumbai’s financial losses as a direct consequence of flooding to be ₹14,000 crore between 2005 and 2015.

Experts fear that the financial damage in Mumbai is only going to increase as the city’s natural drainage continues to be subsumed by concrete. In 2019, for example, a plush residential township built on the floodplains of the Mothali river in Dombivali, was flooded with water entering the homes of even those living on the first floor, while similar projects built on the floodplains of the Waldhuni and Ulhas rivers have also experienced similar distress in between 2018 and 2021.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has also noticed that the Mithi River took longer to drain its water into the sea this year than during past seasons, leading to apprehension that Mumbai is staring at more floods in the coming years. Officials and experts attributed this to a combination of factors, including heavy rains coinciding with high-tide, and clogging up of drainage channels with muck and garbage. The BMC this year spent a total of ₹150 crore on its monsoon flood management plan, which showed little to no improvement at fixing the underlying problem.

In fact, rapid development of infrastructure may be creating problems in places where they did not exist earlier. For example, residents reported unprecedented waterlogging in 2020 along the strip of South Mumbai that runs from Worli to Girgaum Chowpatty, allegedly due to the Coastal Road project that has buried about 5km of the intertidal zone along the shore, thus preventing water from draining into the sea.

In August 2018, the people of Kerala saw one of the worst floods since the great floods of 1924. The state received 96% excess rainfall than predicted, setting off massive floods in most regions. Agriculture, housing, fisheries, animal husbandry and other businesses, and the natural flora and fauna of the state, faced huge losses. The State Land Revenue Department reported around 330 landslides, and the projected economic loss crossed INR 31,000 crore. More than 100 people were reported dead due to the landslides. The landslides also resulted in crop loss, with more than 300 acres of coffee and tea plantations in the state affected.

The erosion of the topsoil is common during extreme floods. This leads to further erosion of the underlying soil and can trigger huge landslides. Studies have shown that flood-related soil erosion events have been increasing across India, especially in states like Kerala, which receives heavy rainfall and has steep gradients and undulations in its topography. In a study, published in the Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing, researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) and Rural Data Research and Analysis (RuDRA), Mumbai, assessed the soil erosion rates before, during and after the Kerala 2018 floods. This data helped in understanding the extent of damage caused by the floods to the land and soil system in the state and can guide the relief measures needed to improve the overall conservation of natural resources.

The frequency of extreme floods and natural calamities has increased in the last few decades. Several reasons have been cited for this, none more frequently than climate change. “Reasons for the increase in flood events depends on many factors varying from climate change-induced factors, land use, land cover change, anthropogenic stressors [such as mismanagement] and antecedent hydrological conditions [such as heavy precipitation rate],” says Prof Pennan Chinnasamy from the Center for Technology Alternatives for Rural Areas (CTARA), IIT Bombay.

The researchers studied the factors affecting soil erosion rates using data such as precipitation and rainfall, digital soil map, elevations in the land and satellite imagery obtained from remote sensing platforms. They also analysed the variation in soil erosion rates across the state. The results were startling.

The average soil erosion rate increased by 80% during the 2018 Kerala floods compared to January 2018. This is in line with the Government of Kerala study conducted in 2018, which estimated that up to 71% of the state’s total area was eroded during the floods.

The districts of Kerala surrounding the Western Ghats received higher amounts of rainfall, with Idukki being the highest. The mountain ranges lift moist hot air, leading to condensation and eventually causing rainfall, a phenomenon known as orographic precipitation. The Rainfall Erosivity Factor, estimating the soil's susceptibility to erosion, ranged from 133 to 179, indicating high rainfall and associated soil erosion from June to August and a huge variation between the districts.

“Rainfall in Kerala has always been higher than the average values due to the orographic effect from the Western Ghats, which is due to the undulating topography,” said Prof Chinnasamy. “With such higher rainfall rates in Kerala, it is necessary to protect the land from excess soil erosion as the rainfall quantitatively represents the impact on the soil surface,” he added.

The Soil Erodibility Factor, estimating the susceptibility of the soil to erosion, was on the higher end, with the highest in Alappuzha district, indicating that the sandy soil present across the state is prone to erosion. This factor also pointed towards the highly undulating topography of the Western Ghats. Such a topography with curves and slopes and a loose topsoil increases the erosion.

The Cover Management Factor analysis showed that the vegetation cover decreased by around 63% from January 2018 to August 2018. The vegetative land was converted to near barren condition due to the floods, making it further susceptible to soil erosion.

Similarly, the average Conservation Practice Factor, which quantifies the lack of impact of the soil and water conservation measures on minimising soil erosion, increased from 0.8 in January 2018 to 0.89 in August 2018. The highest increase, from 0.5 to 1, was seen in Idukki, Kottayam, Ernakulam and Thrissur. The increase points towards cropland damage due to waterlogging and washing away of topsoil due to the floods.

The researchers found that the Idukki district had an increase of 220% in the soil erosion rate during the floods, while Ernakulam showed an increase of 95%. Both districts have the dual distinction of being bordered by the Western Ghats, causing heavy rainfall, and a huge rise in urbanisation. A study conducted in 2017 found that forest cover in Idukki had fallen by over 44% between 1925 and 2012 while the settlements increased by 400%.

On similar lines, the rate and total amount of sediment deposited increased dramatically during the 2018 floods, with Idukki being the worst affected. The sediment comes from the soil carried by the rivers and other water streams from the land into the ocean. Since the district and the surrounding area are home to many rivers and water streams, high erosion rates also cause downstream erosion as more water gets accumulated and flows with higher velocities, thereby increasing the amount of deposition.

The data also shows that the high erosion rates are not only due to the heavy rainfall but also because of the unsustainable conversion of natural land into human settlements.

“In some regions, there is a monsoon shift observed or an increase in the concentration of rain events, which has led to less water storage in the watershed and more floods. In other regions, we have noticed a drastic change in land use and land cover patterns which alters the hydrological regime leading to flash floods,” says Prof Chinnasamy.

It is, therefore, necessary to understand and improve the methods of human settlement and soil management towards a more sustainable, climate-friendly future.

“Setting up monitoring stations for collection of sediment data and soil nutrient data and educating the locals on the need for soil conservation activities are much needed to tackle these sensitive issues,” Prof Chinnasamy concludes.

BHPian shekar.ca recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

Hello all,

I wanted to post on an evolving situation - Chennai has seen persistent rains for the past 2 days and due to resultant floods, the basement of my apartment complex is underwater. Amongst other vehicles under 6-7ft of water are my Jeep Compass 2.0 MT Diesel and Royal Enfield Interceptor 650.

Compass is just over 1 month old and has been driven around 1,200 km so far. The Interceptor on the other hand is 2.5 years old and in good condition, last ridden a couple of days ago.

I parked the Compass in the basement at 10 pm last night when there were no signs of flooding. I was woken up by the ringing doorbell at around 2.30 am this morning, saying water was flooding into the basement. By the time I went down, the water was at too high a level for me to enter the basement and it's been that way for 12 hrs now.

I have in the meanwhile reached out to a service advisor at VTK Jeep (the dealer) to understand the process I need to follow. He asked me to wait it out and once the water recedes, ask for the Jeep RSA to tow the car away, post which the damage assessment, claim processing, etc. will start. I guess a similar action needs to be initiated with Royal Enfield as well.

While I am helpless for the moment and am waiting for rains to subside, water to recede (or pumped out of the basement), there are so many questions running in my mind. Request help and inputs/ tips from the members in this forum on the following:

Once I get the vehicles towed away, what happens then? Would this be a full loss kind of situation?

If the insurance company insists on repairs, how do I handle it? Isn't it unlikely that both vehicles won't have a long term impact from this kind of exposure underwater?

If approved for a total loss, would I get the IDV paid out by the insurance company? Am I eligible for a proportionate refund of the life/ road tax?

Thanks in advance!

Thanks for your kind words. The parking is in the basement and I do have the return to invoice cover. The below photos are all I could manage to give an idea of the situation.

Approach into the basement from the ground floor:

Basement view:

There must be 6-7 cars and around 10 bikes parked inside - nothing is visible right now and it's dangerous to attempt entering the basement until the water recedes at least a little.

I have contacted the dealer, who says the car will be fully repaired, but I am not sure if I should even consider accepting that. Or do I even have a choice?

Here's what BHPian libranof1987 had to say on the matter

Since you have RTI, you are looking at almost 0 financial loss (maybe barring some processing charge/deductible). A two-year-old X1 in my extended family was submerged (a little over half) in the Mumbai floods a few months back and was deemed a total loss. They had RTI as well and got the entire amount back. Looking at the pictures, it seems that the entire vehicle is underwater. So, there is a high possibility of it being declared a total loss. But it really depends on how much the ASC calculates as repair cost. Whether it can be repaired - everything can be repaired, completely mangled or submerged-in-mud vehicles are repaired/restored. Whether you have a choice - unlikely. If the ASC comes up with a repair cost that is <75% of the IDV, there is nothing you can do to reject repair. Work with your dealer and push for total loss. That said, completely submerged cars are more often than not repaired and sold. Whether that's a good idea or not - is an individual choice.

Here's what BHPian windrider had to say on the matter:

There is no way your jeep can be repaired. My cousin lost a 7-month-old Polo in the 2018 Kerala floods. It was submerged up to the window level for 3 days and it was declared a total loss. At that time VW showroom was only trying to repair cars that were submerged up to a little above the axle. Cars that were submerged in deeper water were declared as a total loss. He lost only about 40-50k off the purchase price. The rest of the car value was paid back to him by his insurance. His 1991 re 350 was also submerged, but he was able to fix it completely and only spent under 2,000. Unfortunately since then, a lot of rust has appeared in various locations and he is trying to sell it off. If your 650 is repairable, get it fixed and sell it. There is no way that bike is going to last even if repaired since it has been completely submerged. The electronics and wiring might work fine for now, but eventually, you will run into trouble.

Here's what BHPian VW2010 had to say on the matter:

First thing, relax and stay calm. There is absolutely nothing you can do now to save or salvage that car. You will get your insurance claim and this car will be sold at auction. There is no way Jeep will risk repairing this car and it is cheaper to sell it in auction for the insurance company. You can calmly wait and get the same colour Jeep in 2 months time. Cars are cheaper to make in the factory while replacing every part on the car will probably double the cost and hence repair cost will be way higher than the IDV in my humble opinion. I am on the opposite side of your road and I parked my Nano and Endeavor on the street and will take it back to my basement only after Friday. My basement is dry for that matter and yet with this picture you have posted, I am not risking anything. Remember, it is just a car.

Here's what BHPian Aniruddha_Ch had to say on the matter:

Having worked in an automobile dealership for a brief period, I can say that if water goes above the dashboard, then such cases are most likely to be treated as totalled loss (Add-on cover like EP, CM, RTI will come to your rescue). Glad that you're safe and protected inside your home.

Heat waves. Floods. Wildfires. It's been a destructive summer so far, and forecasts for droughts, fires and hurricanes are looking downright bleak.

We know that climate change is to blame. But how exactly is global warming driving dangerous weather?

Lauren Sommer and Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate team broke down the details in a conversation with Morning Edition's Noel King.

The country is experiencing yet another heat wave this week. Is it just us or is this summer unusual?

It's not just our memories — this past June was the hottest June recorded in the U.S. in more than a century, about four degrees hotter on average. Heat waves (like in the Pacific Northwest) can be deadly, and many cities are just realizing now how underprepared they are to deal with them.

What's the connection between these extreme heat events and climate change?

There's been about two degrees Fahrenheit of warming so far worldwide. The number sounds small, but it's enough to ""profoundly shift the statistics of extreme heat events,"" according to Dr. Radley Horton, a climate scientist at Columbia University. He says these ""dangerous thresholds of really high temperature and high humidity"" could potentially happen twice as often as they have in the past.

What does this mean for wildfires?

About 95% of the West is in drought right now, and there's a clear cycle where heat dries out land and vegetation. So when wildfires do happen, they burn hotter and even create their own weather systems in which huge pyrocumulus clouds can generate lightning strike — in turn causing even more fires.

What does a hotter Earth have to do with flash flooding?

It's been a wild few weeks for flash flood disasters, from Central China to western Europe to Mumbai to Arizona. These fast-moving waters have killed hundreds of people, but they're not a surprise to climate scientists, who have been sounding the alarms for years.

Even though these floods happened around their world, their root cause was the same: extreme rain. And it's getting more common as the Earth gets warmer (hot air + hot water = more moisture in the air).

Plus, as the planet heats up, some climate models show winds in the upper atmosphere slowing down in certain places, which would mean that extreme weather would linger there longer.

Scientists are working hard to predict how common these disasters will be in the years to come. After all, lives are on the line.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who held flood review meetings on Wednesday, has ordered that panchanamas of agricultural land submerged by the flooding, mainly caused by dam discharges, must be done at the earliest to assess the damage to the standing kharif crop.

As per the relief and rehabilitation department, the damage to the farms in Aurangabad, Latur, Beed and Osmanabad districts has been immense.

The survey of damaged houses is yet to take place; government records show damage to 25 houses while 317 persons have been evacuated in the last 48 hours.

Very intense development seen over west coast with monsoon vigorous on North Konkan, said IMD Mumbai centre's deputy director general K.S. Hosalikar on Twitter on Wednesday. He further said that Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Palghar and also the ghat areas of Maharashtra will receive extremely heavy rainfall in next 24 hours.





He said Mumbai already recorded rainfall of 100 mm within six hours on Wednesday.

Hosalikar said Mumbai, Thane rainfall in six hours since Wednesday morning indicate at isolated places the recorded values are between 70-100 mm and other places its 40+ mm.

He said rains are going to continue with moderate to heavy spells across and that red alert has been issued for Mumbai, Palghar, Thane and Raigad.

Dahanu in Palghar recorded over 350 mm rainfall in the 12-hour period ending at 5.30 am on Wednesday while some areas in Thane received over 150 mm during the period, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, and predicted more intense showers during the day.

Water-logging was reported in low lying areas of Chembur, Parel, Hindmata, Wadala and other areas of Mumbai.

""The cloud activity indicates that there would be one more intense rainfall day on Wednesday,"" Hosalikar tweeted.

""Heavy to very heavy with isolated extremely heavy rains possible in next 24 over entire Konkan region. In North Konkan the impact could be more including Thane, Mumbai and Palghar,"" he said.

Parts of south Madhya Maharashtra and adjoining Marathwada region are also likely to get very heavy rainfall, along with intense spells, he said.

""With formation of low pressure area on Tuesday in North Bay, as forecast by the IMD, it has resulted into strengthening of lower level southerly winds over Arabian sea. It has brought heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places in and around Mumbai, Hosalikar said.

The Pune district also received 59 mm rainfall in the last 24 hours and it is likely to witness moderate to isolated heavy showers in next two days, an IMD official said.

The catchment areas of four dams - Varasgaon, Khadakwasla, Panshet and Temghar which provide water to the city - received good rainfall.

Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said since good rainfall is predicted by the IMD, the city is not likely to face any water cuts till the Ganesh festival, which begins on August 22.

On Wednesday, large parts of south Mumbai were inundated after the island city reported its heaviest single-day downpour in August in 46 years with 293.8 mm of rainfall.

“The island city’s drainage system is 140 years old, designed by the British. At that time, most of the island city was green. The drainage system was designed considering that 50 per cent of rainwater will be going through drains and the rest will percolate into the ground water. Now very few parts in south Mumbai are open but the underground drainage system has remained the same,” environmentalist Debi Goenka said.

The amount of rain that Mumbai experiences has remained unchanged over the last 80 years. The old drainage system, along with Mumbai’s then abundant open spaces, allowed the percolation of water and its faster dispersal. The gradual concretisation of open spaces has meant that the percolation of water does not happen the way it used to be.

On Wednesday, many areas in south Mumbai, which usually do not see waterlogging, were flooded for hours. According to the India Meteorological Department, in nine hours, its Colaba observatory recorded 225 mm of rainfall. The last time the area had seen heavier rain than Wednesday’s was in 1974.

Areas like Churchgate, Marine Drive, Fort, Girgaum, Khetwadi, Walkeshwar Road, J J Marg, Gol Deol, Bhendi Bazaar, Kalbadevi were flooded and water entered several houses.

Urban planner and executive director of Urban Design Research Institute (UDRI), Pankaj Joshi, said that the city needs to change its planning in view of climate change. “Some are still denying climate change. This phenomenon of heavy rains in a few hours is happening frequently. Our storm water drain network can drain out 25 mm to 50 mm per hour but draining 280 mm is virtually impossible. You need to be prepared and to quickly understand that our city needs to be engineered. Now, we should look for preventing disaster rather than management,”said Joshi.

He pointed out that BMC’s BRIMSTOWAD (Brihanmumbai Storm Water Drain System) project has been going on for 13 years. It comprised 58 works, including rehabilitation and augmentation of underground drains, widening and deepening of nullahs and construction of pumping stations. After spending Rs 1,200 crore so far, the civic body has only completed 38 works.

According to BMC data, the island city has the highest population density with around 46,000 people living in 1 sq km as against the city’s average of 29,000 in per sq km. The island city is spread over 68.71 sq km with a population of 31.58 lakh and being the oldest part of the city, has hardly any place to develop further.

Environmental activists, however, pointed out that the construction of the coastal road as well as the Metro, which have been going on for the last few years, have accelerated south Mumbai’s urban infrastructure woes.

“The problem is accentuated because of the combination of reclamation and construction. During such projects, the barriers set up, construction materials and debris may clog the drainage system. The more hard-paved barriers you create, the more water tends to run off. Some of these situations are unavoidable but then you should have the right drainage channel to reduce waterlogging,” said Hussain Indorewala, professor in Kamala Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute of Architecture in Mumbai.

In the past, BMC has sent written to the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited on Metro 3 (Colaba-Seepz) work clogging and damaging drains.

The BMC, meanwhile, believes that what happened on Wednesday was a weather anomaly and the flooding was the result of heavy rains that the area experienced in a short period of time.

“Coastal road project contractors have taken all precautions for discharge of drain water. At one place near Nair hospital, there was some clogging of drains due to their work but that has also been cleared by them. Heavy rainfall in a very short time is the reason behind flooding in these areas,” said an official from BMC’s storm water drainage department.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

It was also the heaviest single-day downpour ever received in August. In addition, gusty winds, touching speeds of 110 km per hour, reminded residents of Cyclone Nisarga that had swung past the city’s coast on June 5. The observatory at Santacruz, which records rainfall in the suburbs, registered 110 mm of rainfall on August 5.

Several areas in south Mumbai, such as Churchgate, Mantralaya, Nariman Point, Fort, Marine Drive, Girgaum, Khetwadi, Walkeshwar Road, J.J. Marg, Bhendi Bazar, Gol Deol and Kalbadevi, were flooded for the first time in recent history. The ground floor of the Maharashtra government-run J.J. Hospital was waterlogged for hours. The road outside Mantralaya was also flooded. A video circulating on social media purportedly showed Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar driving past a waterlogged Mantralaya and remarking that he had never seen the area flooded. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on August 10 that flooding in Mumbai had caused losses to the tune of Rs 500 crore.

Floods are not new in Mumbai, a cluster of seven islands—Colaba, Little Colaba, Isle of Bombay, Mazgaon, Parel, Worli and Mahim—reclaimed from the sea by the British. The city area, however, has been largely considered safer than the suburbs because a robust colonial-era drainage system rendered it nearly flood-proof. Even during Mumbai’s worst floods, triggered by the downpour of July 26, 2005, the island city had been largely unaffected. The suburbs received 944 mm of rainfall in a day—the highest so far—and suffered widespread devastation.

According to BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) records, south Mumbai, spread over 68.7 sq. km, has the highest population density, with 46,000 people living in 1 sq. km as against the city’s average of 29,000 per sq. km. There is little place for further development. The BMC spends 18 per cent of its budget of about Rs 34,000 crore on civic infrastructure, but that does not reflect in the city’s monsoon preparedness.

The August 5 flooding disproved the theory that waterlogging has been a problem in the low-lying areas alone. While the city’s drainage coped well with the rains, flushing out water into the sea within hours, unplanned development and the BMC’s inefficiency in maintaining and upgrading the drainage in the past two decades have severely aggravated the waterlogging problem.

This time, two prominent infrastructure works are being blamed for the flooding—the Colaba-SEEPZ underground metro line and the Nariman Point-Borivali coastal road. These works allegedly choked the drainage lines, resulting into waterlogging. While BJP leader Kirit Somaiya has raised doubts about whether the BMC had done the annual pre-monsoon cleaning of the drains, BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal has countered: “I have lived in Mumbai for 40 years, but never seen such incessant rains in south Mumbai. In this situation, any city in the world would have drowned.” The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation, too, claims they are not at fault as they are equipped with dewatering pumps as part of the monsoon-related preparedness.

Blame game aside, there is an urgent need to upgrade the city’s 140-year-old drainage system, say experts. Environmentalist Debi Goenka says the drainage system was designed to clear only 50 per cent of the rainwater, with the rest supposed to percolate into the ground. The design was suitable at the time the drainage system was laid by the British since the city area had more green spaces. Unplanned development and lack of open spaces have now overburdened the system.

The BMC’s storm water disposal system project meant to upgrade the city’s drainage system after the July 2005 deluge is running way behind schedule. Fifteen years and Rs 20,000 crore later, the project has revamped only 20 storm-water drains, of the total of 51. Mumbai’s storm-water drains have the capacity to carry only 50 mm of rain water an hour, as opposed at least 75 mm of rainwater an hour. Urban planner Anant Gadgil says there is a need to make drastic changes in the city’s planning considering that heavy rains over short periods are becoming a norm. Is the BMC listening?

People who live in areas normally unaffected by the annual monsoon flooding looked out from their high-rise flats at new swirling rivers outside caused by the heaviest single day’s rain recorded in August in 47 years.

Wednesday saw extraordinary downpours and winds of more than 100km/h tossing cars aside, uprooting trees, tearing down hoardings and smashing cranes at the port.

Even on Marine Drive, the famous arc-shaped boulevard that runs alongside the Arabian Sea and is lined with art deco buildings, the relentless rain caused flooding. This area is normally not affected by torrential monsoon rain as the drainage system usually works better than in low-lying areas of the city that are usually worst-hit.

Other areas where the elite live – Fort, Colaba, Churchgate, Breach Candy and Pedder Road – and where many heritage buildings are located, were also flooded.

So far India’s commercial capital has been inundated with 2,319mm of rain. The annual average is 2,260mm.

“Every year we suffer from flooding, every year it’s the same nightmare but this is altogether different. I saw coconuts flying off in the air and smashing into car windows,” said Reshma Patil who lives on the 10th floor of an apartment block on Peddar Road.

Her neighbour said he saw signposts and huge metal sheets from a nearby construction site flying past his window.

Waterlogged roads, fallen trees and abandoned cars have added to the usual traffic mayhem in this city of 12 million people where approximately 60% of the population live in slums. Train and bus services have been suspended and many flights cancelled.

People who are stranded and unable to go home have been put up inside schools that have been turned into temporary shelters.

Every year monsoon rains bring the city to a halt and expose its crumbling infrastructure. Every year the city authorities promise to clear the Victorian-era drainage system of silt and debris before the monsoon hits but the same deluge happens, disrupting normal life for weeks.

The flooding is yet another battle for residents overwhelmed by the Covid-19 pandemic. Mumbai is the worst-affected city in the country. Infections have been rising across the India since March, with around 1.8 million infections and close to 40,000 deaths.

A survey last month showed that more than half the people who live in its sprawling slums had been infected with the virus.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Every year, Mumbai receives very heavy rain within a short time, which usually brings the city to a halt. Urban flooding is common in the city from June to September, resulting in the crippling of traffic, railways and airlines.

In a joint initiative between the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) and Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, the warning system is expected to be deployed next month, as monsoon is set to enter the state by June 10.

“The monitoring system is ready for deployment in Mumbai. All information regarding possible flood-prone areas, likely height the flood water could attain, and other details will be shared with the corporation. They can then disseminate alerts to the public,” M Rajeevan, secretary, MoES said on Friday.

Once operational, Mumbai will be the second city in the country to have such a system, after Chennai. However, weather models and tools used for the system in Mumbai are different.

The work for developing such a system had begun over two years ago. During this period, topography maps, details of drainage and pipelines, lakes, rivers and other water bodies within Mumbai were acquired. Besides, a good network of rain gauges was laid throughout the city, which was led by a team of scientists at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) Pune.

The primary source for the system will be the rainfall, but with Mumbai being a coastal city, the system will also factor in tidal waves and storm tides for its flood assessments.

Based on the amount of rain recorded, time, location, topography and forecast, the system is designed to generate flood warnings for specific geographical areas of the city. All this information will then be routed to authorities, said the MoES secretary.

He emphasises that the system will act as a guide towards decision-making for the local administration, in case of possible flooding after heavy rainfall.

hen asked about the lead time to relay flood information to the civic body, Rajeevan said, “We will use the existing Nowcast warning, which is provided up to six hours in advance. We will also give forecasts two days in advance.”

Nowcast is a weather forecast issued by India Meteorological Department (IMD) for weather events likely to take place within the immediate six hours over a particular area. These are mainly issued for weather events like heavy rainfall, thunderstorm, hailstorm and lightning.

In several pockets, rainwater took over 12 hours to recede. This is the second time since August 5 when South Mumbai has been hit severely by rain, disrupting normal life and affecting road and rail network.

South Mumbai

Island City areas like Mohammed Ali Road, Gol Deol, Grant Road, Navjeevan Society, Mumbai Central, Byculla, Worli Seaface, Chinchpokli, Parel, Hindmata, Dadar TT, Kings Circle and Sion witnessed flooding for over 10 hours. Several houses in low-lying areas remained submerged for hours.

BEST cut electricity supply in Chinchpokli area to avoid short-circuits. “Chinchpokli area usually does not see waterlogging and even if there is, it recedes in half an hour. But the situation was different this time. Intensity of rain was very severe and till Wednesday morning water level was up to two feet,” Shiv Sena corporator Ramakant Rahate said.

Grant Road areas like Nana Chowk and Gilder Lane too were submerged. “Our staff opened manholes and drainage chambers for rainwater to recede faster. But rain intensity was high and as rainfall occurred after a month’s gap, a lot of floating material had entered the drain

clogging water flow,” said Prashant Gaikwad, Assistant Municipal Commissioner, D Ward (Malabar Hill, Grant Road).

Gaikwad said South Mumbai’s drains are old and augmentation is on, still they have a capacity to drain 25 mm water per hour. “If there is more than 100 mm rainfall in an hour there will be waterlogging in these areas,” said Gaikwad.

Water also entered Mumbai Central railway station premises. Officials admitted they have never seen such flooding in Mumbai Central. “After 11 pm rain intensity increased and in 3-4 hours the area received about 300 mm rainfall. The drain carrying water to Britannia pumping station was full of water and as there was high tide at night water started coming back from the drains. Mumbai Central has not seen this kind of flooding in the last about 20 years,” said Makarand Dagadkhair, Assistant Municipal Commissioner, E ward (Byculla). He denied ongoing Metro 3 work blocked drains.

In Parel, water entered Damodar Hall, damaging seats and other materials. However, BMC officials said they will check if there was waterlogging in the hall. Local Shiv Sena corporator Urmila Panchal said there was waterlogging in areas that have never been flooded in years. Water also entered BDD Chawls at Delisle Road and Worli area. A retaining wall collapsed at Police Colony in Worli. No injuries were reported.

Western Suburbs

Areas like Bandra, Andheri, Jogeshwari, Goregaon, Malad and Dahisar witnessed waterlogging. Chincholi fire station recorded the highest 327.4 mm rainfall following Malad fire station at 302.51 mm in the last 24 hours.

In Goregaon water entered houses and chawls. Vishal Rathod, a resident of 17th Road, Siddharth Nagar, Goregaon West, posted a video of water entering his house.

Local BJP corporator Harsh Patel said the problem happened due to heavy rainfall and encroachment along Shastri Nagar nullah. “The widening of nullah and removal of encroachment was started but stopped due to Covid-19. The nullah is proposed to be widened about 15 metres and is currently about 2 metres,” said Patel.

Explained Concretisation of open spaces The amount of rainfall that falls in Mumbai has remained unchanged over the last 80 years. The old drainage system coupled with the then Mumbai's abundant open spaces allowed the percolation of water and its faster dispersal. The gradual concretisation of open spaces has meant that the percolation of water does not happen the way it used to. Environmentalists believe shrinking open spaces and increasing constructions for big ticket infrastructure projects are causing the unnatural flooding that pockets of the city are now witnessing.

Rising water level in Walbhut river damaged the water pipeline and Oshiwara bridge, which has been shut to traffic. Local BJP corporator Sandeep Patel said during the night, water level in the river rose to bridge level and later it started flowing over the bridge. “The flow of water was very intense. It broke the water pipeline and also damaged the surface of the bridge. BMC staff have completed repair work on the pipeline but bridge repair will take time. Work will be taken up once rain stops,” said Patel. Oshiwara bridge is located at the junction of S V Road and Ram Mandir. Waterlogging was also reported outside Oberoi Mall, Shastri Nagar and Milan Subway.

Eastern Suburbs

Highest rainfall of 300 mm was recorded in L ward (Kurla). After the level of Mithi River reached danger mark, BMC evacuated 50 residents of Kranti Nagar and moved them to a safer location late Tuesday night. In the morning they went back to their homes after water level receded. Waterlogging was reported from Bail Bazar, Kurla Depot to Sheetal Cinema, Shell Colony, Chembur, Mankhurd Subway; however, no untoward incidents were reported.

Navi Mumbai

Overnight rain in Navi Mumbai left several areas in the satellite city inundated. Konkan Bhavan, in Belapur, the divisional office of the five districts of Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg reported ankle-deep water.

Two security guards of a highrise in Agripada died after rainwater flooded the basement of the building, trapping them in an elevator. For the second time this year, South Mumbai, which usually doesn’t see waterlogging, saw unprecedented flooding in several parts.

Mumbai’s suburbs received the season’s most intense showers, recording 286.4 mm rain between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, categorised as extremely heavy rainfall. Of this, 107 mm rain was recorded over six hours on Tuesday (5.30 pm to 11.30 pm) and remaining 179.4 mm from 11.30 pm to 5.30 am, Wednesday. Colaba observatory, representative of South Mumbai, recorded 147.8 mm (very heavy) rain in 24 hours. Of this, 89 mm rain was recorded over six hours on Tuesday (5.30 pm to 11.30 pm) and the remaining 58.5 mm till 8.30 am, Wednesday.

Normal life was affected in the city as floodwaters entered residential premises in Dadar, Worli and Goregaon areas, with some areas recording waist-deep water.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) shut down all semi-government, government and private offices (except essential services). The Bombay High Court Chief Justice declared a holiday for the High Court after severe waterlogging in the city.

Following the overnight rainfall, waterlogging complaints were received from 19 spots across the city. Several areas including Hindmata and Gandhi Market in Dadar, Sion Road 24, Andheri, Malad and Dahisar Subway, Bandra Talkies, Old Khar and Shastri Nagar, Goregaon remained in knee-deep to waist-deep water till late Wednesday afternoon. According to the civic body, Gandhi Market’s main road was opened to traffic by 3:30 pm, while the side-way remained inundated.

The BMC diverted buses from over 100 routes on Wednesday morning. Thirty BEST buses were stuck in waterlogged roads. Over 30 roads were flooded due to which BEST had to divert buses or cancel services.

Local train services were also affected due to waterlogging on the tracks. Central Railways services between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Thane railway station were suspended on Wednesday morning. All four lines of Central Railways were shut from 4.20 am due to waterlogging between Dadar and Kurla stations, and Masjid Bundar, according to BMC’s disaster management department. The harbour line between CSMT and Vashi was also affected.

Western Railways also said they were suspending local train services due to waterlogging. Train services between Churchgate and Andheri railway stations were suspended, to be restored only after 4 pm.

BMC officials said extremely heavy rain with high tide reaching 4.1 metres at around 4 am, followed by neap tide at 10 am, led to excessive flooding and slow receding of floodwaters from many areas. In a neap tide, the difference between low and high tides is not much and the discharge of stormwater into the sea is very slow.

A retaining wall abutting the hillside in Khareghat Parsi Colony at Huges Roads near Bablunath collapsed and mud entered flats on the ground floor of a two-storey building. No residents were injured in the incident. However, as the mud was still loose, as a precautionary measure, the civic body asked the ground and first-floor residents to vacate their flats.

Meanwhile, the BMC evacuated at least 50 residents living around the banks of Mithi river at Kranti Nagar, Kurla, around 6 am as the water levels crossed the 3.3-metre mark. A civic official from BMC’s disaster management department said, “Water receded by 8 am, and a few people returned home. The situation is under control.”

According to the BMC, eight wall collapses, 12 tree-fall incidents and 40 short circuit complaints were registered across the city.

Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal along with Environment and Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray and BMC officials visited parts of Mumbai to take stock of the situation. Aaditya tweeted, “Extreme weather events now aren’t rare anymore. Climate change is a real thing. We’ve seen record break temperatures, rainfall, storms, droughts and floods in our country over the past few years. We need to act on climate change mitigation and action as a larger action plan. I have requested the officials at (BMC) to work actively and expeditiously on the underground flood control tanks, as the extreme rainfall events increase every year, breaking the records of the past few decades.”

This is the heaviest rain the suburbs received this season and the second-highest 24-hour September spell in a decade. Overnight rains recorded were 286.4 mm, which is 91 per cent of average monthly rainfall (314.4 mm). Between September 1 and 23, Mumbai recorded 433.4 mm, crossing the average September rainfall.

(Express photo by Deepak Joshi/File)

Maharashtra’s Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Science and Technology, Dr Harsh Vardhan launched an Integrated Flood Warning System called ‘IFLOWS-Mumbai’ on Friday.

A joint initiative between the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the warning system will be able to relay alerts of possible flood-prone areas anywhere between six to 72 hours in advance. Mumbai is only the second city in the country after Chennai to get this system. Similar systems are being developed for Bengaluru and Kolkata.

What is ‘IFLOWS-Mumbai’?

IFLOWS is a monitoring and flood warning system that will be able to relay alerts of possible flood-prone areas anywhere between six to 72 hours in advance. The system can provide all information regarding possible flood-prone areas, likely height the floodwater could attain, location-wise problem areas across all 24 wards and calculate the vulnerability and risk of elements exposed to flood.

How will it work?

The primary source for the system is the amount of rainfall, but with Mumbai being a coastal city, the system also factors in tidal waves and storm tides for its flood assessments. In the last two years, researchers have been conducting studies to provide real-time weather information by measuring the city’s rainfall, how much water drained out, topography, land use, infrastructure development, population, lakes, creeks and data on river bathymetry of all rivers namely Mithi, Dahisar, Oshiwara, Poisar and Ulhas.

Why was this system needed in Mumbai?

Mumbai, the financial capital of India, has been experiencing floods with increased periodicity. The recent flood on 29 August 2017 had brought the city to a standstill. Last year, post-monsoon and unseasonal rainfall as late as October, two tropical cyclones in the Arabian Sea had caught authorities off guard and left a trail of destruction. The flood during 26th July 2005, when the city received a rainfall of 94 cm, a 100 year high in a span of 24 hours had paralyzed the city completely. Urban flooding is common in the city from June to September, resulting in the crippling of traffic, railways and airlines. As a preparedness for floods before they occur, the system will help in warning the citizens so that they can be prepared in advance for flooding conditions.

How will it be beneficial for Mumbai?

Based on the amount of rain recorded, time, location, topography and forecast, the system is designed to generate flood warnings for specific geographical areas of the city. All this information will then be routed to authorities. The early warning forecast would include alerts on rainfall information, tide levels, storm surge for low-lying areas anticipated to be affected, thereby minimizing the damage from cyclones and heavy rain events in Mumbai by evacuating people to safe areas. The system, initially only to be accessed by the civic body will enable them to issue alerts for citizens who can then avoid such zones.",,2017 Mumbai Floods,"Mumbai, India",29 August 2017,31 August 2017,"['Mumbai City', 'Thane', 'Palghar']",['94 cm'],['$10 billion'],['180'],"['Crippling of traffic, railways and airlines']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

By the year 2022, India will possess the technology to forecast extreme weather events like the ‘cloudburst’ at least two days in advance, the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) informed a parliamentary committee earlier this month. This development is likely to go a long way in helping the governments save lives and property from downpour-related destruction.

In the report submitted to the Rajya Sabha in early March, as per Hindustan Times, the parliamentary committee stated that MoES will soon be capable of making a probabilistic prediction on the possibility of cloudburst events over a specific region 48 hours in advance. This feat will be made possible by an enhanced computing facility; in comparison, the current facilities allow us to predict cloudbursts just two to three hours before the actual event.

Cloudbursts can be described as sudden, heavy rain storms that cause extreme amounts of precipitation in a very short amount of time. When a particular area records more than 100 mm rainfall in just one hour, the phenomenon is categorised as a cloudburst. The heavy rains that flooded Mumbai back in July 2005 and Uttarakhand in June 2013 were both the results of cloudbursting.

However, unlike other extreme weather events like cyclones, making accurate forecasts on cloudbursts is difficult, primarily because the nature of rapidly developing clouds over a small area is exceptionally dynamic.

But in two years’ time, it will indeed be made possible through further development in the high-performance computing (HPC) system that India’s weather forecasting system currently relies on.

Advertisement At present, the HPC system possesses a capacity of 10 PetaFlops. However, plans are in place to boost the current HPC to 40 PFlops by 2022, and to 100 PFlops by 2024. This update will not only expand the time difference between the prediction and the occurrence of the weather event, but also vastly improve the resolution and the precision of the forecast in terms of geography.

At present, the forecasts have a resolution that is accurate up to 12 kms, but advanced computing systems will improve it down to 5 km, or maybe even 3 km, reveals Madhavan Nair Rajeevan, secretary of MoES. Further, apart from the horizontal resolution, the vertical resolution will also increase, thereby enabling meteorologists to analyse the fast-changing microphysical characteristics of clouds.

The improved technology will, without doubt, play a major role in allowing the concerned authorities at least two days to initiate pre-emptive actions, carry out evacuations, and make the necessary arrangements to ensure there is minimal damage to life and property in the predicted cloudburst-affected region.

And with extreme weather events becoming increasingly frequent not just in India, but around the world, this development most certainly answers the call for the hour.

The civic body found that a collapsed drain and alterations made to a large drain led to the inundation.

The civic body undertook an internal investigation to find out the reasons behind the flooding at spots which have rarely submerged during rain in the past.

On August 5, heavy rain coupled with gusty winds caused unusual flooding in several parts of south Mumbai. Areas like Girgaon Chowpatty and Marine Drive saw flooding. Seawater entered Girgaon Chowpatty and Walkeshar Road.

Officials said during inspections it was found a drain on N S Patkar Road had collapsed during the rain. The investigation also revealed there was no drain from Nana Nani Park to Wilson College along Marine Drive. The BMC also found an existing drain near Wilson College had been bifurcated into two smaller drains some years ago.

“We used cameras to check the blockages in drains. The drain at N S Patkar Road was old and has collapsed. It will be rebuilt. Also, we have proposed a new drain along Marine Drive,” said a BMC official.

Officials said they were finding out why the big drain was converted into two small drains.

Besides, it was found there is no drain from Teen Batti Naka to Babulnath junction. All the rainwater runs off to Babulnath Junction leading to waterlogging.

According to officials from Storm Water Drain (SWD) department, areas that face excessive flooding during the rains will soon be studied for setting up mini pumping stations as well as flood gates that will further prevent tidal water from entering city drains.

“There are several outfalls that directly discharge into the sea or creeks. Preventing tidal water from entering city drains will give immediate relief from waterlogging. Installing small pumps will further help rainwater to recede faster. This model has been successful in Bandra East as chronic flooding spots, like Kalanagar, Indira Nagar, and Government Colony, witnessed no flooding this monsoon,” a senior official from SWD department said.

He added, “Since arrangement at Kalanagar is 100% successful, now we are planning to replicate the system at other locations.” Other chronic flooding spots in the city include Hindmata, Gandhi Market, and Parel.

Earlier, the BMC said it was planning to create small underground holding ponds to store excess rainwater. However, construction of holding ponds is likely to take at least 3-4 years’ time, so civic officials are looking at flood gates and mini pumping stations as “instant solution”.

According to officials, there are 42 minor and major drains in H East ward (Bandra East) that empty rainwater into the Arabian Sea. Since Kalanagar and Kherwadi areas are saucer-shaped, the water enters these spots during high tide as well.

Over the last several years, the Kalanagar junction and its neighbouring areas, like suburban collector’s office and Vakola, faced waterlogging up to 2 to 2.5 feet height. The matter became a contentious issue for the Shiv Sena, which rules BMC, as party chief and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray lives in the locality.

This year, after several Sena corporators followed up with the BMC to make sure there was no flooding at Kalanagar, the civic body in January came up with an idea of installing a mini pumping station – with a capacity to pump out 49,800-litre water per minute – and six flood gates at outfalls that drain out rainwater into sea. The civic body spent around Rs 11 crore on the project.

The Indian Express had on January 29 reported the BMC’s plan to prevent waterlogging near the residence of the CM.

This year, while several areas in the city witnessed unprecedented flooding for hours due to heavy rainfall in August and September, Kalanagar remained waterlogging-free.

Heavy rain, thunderstorm in Mumbai; BMC says no waterlogging

Heavy rain with thunderstorm hit Mumbai on Saturday evening. The BMC said there were no reports of waterlogging or accidents. According to the disaster management cell, between 6.30 pm and 8.30 pm, the city recorded over 55 mm rainfall at some locations.

The BMC’s weather station data shows the eastern suburbs received 23.54 mm rain, followed by western suburbs at 17.68 mm and the island city at 17.07 mm, between 8 am and 8 pm on Saturday.

According to the civic data, in the island city, maximum 38 mm rainfall was recorded at Britannia pumping station area in Reay Road; in western suburbs, Dahisar fire station recorded 46 mm rainfall; and M-West (Chembur) ward office recorded 57 mm rainfall in eastern suburbs. While the BMC denied waterlogging complaints, residents from Hindmata and Dadar said the rain had caused flooding, but the water receded soon.

Rain, thunderstorm and lightning also hit Navi Mumbai. Earlier in the afternoon, the IMD of Mumbai issued a warning against loud thunderstorm and lightning to hit Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and neighbouring areas. Officials said it was signs of monsoon withdrawal.

In Nair hospital, the makeshift out patient department (OPD) for Covid-19 patients, located near the hospital building, was flooded in the wee hours of Wednesday, forcing the entire set-up to be shifted.

An on-duty doctor said that around 5 am, the Covid-19 OPD — erected with the help of wooden sticks and tarpaulin sheet — started flooding. Waste bins and cardboard boxes with daily supplies started floating as the water level rose till the knee level.

“We started shifting a few patients from the OPD to the casualty ward early morning. The fever OPD is now functioning in the casualty ward,” the doctor added.

With Metro construction work near the hospital redirecting the water flow, the hospital’s main entrance had flooded in August as well after heavy showers.

On Wednesday, the main building of Nair Hospital Dental College — located in the same premises — and the hospital’s entrance was flooded.

A doctor said food and water have been arranged for the staff and the patients. “Our night shift staffers continued in the next shift as the others could not reach the hospital to replace them,” the doctor said.

Assistant Municipal Commissioner of E ward (Byculla), Makarand Dagadkhair, said: “Due to heavy rainfall, water started accumulating around 11.30 pm on Tuesday. The water level outside the hospital area went up to two feet. In three hours, the area received around 300 mm of rainfall.” He added that due to heavy rainfall and high tide, the drainage line could not drain the water.

In Kasturba hospital, while water did not enter the wards, waterlogging at the entrance and outside made life difficult for staffers and patients.

“We were asked to continue in morning shift after our night shift got over,” a ward boy said.

The city’s insufficient drainage system, unsustainable urbanisation, reduction of green cover and natural barriers are enlisted among the top reasons for the floods.

But this information is often too dense or inadequate to understand why citizens can’t spend one monsoon without wading through (and living in) murky rainwater mixed with sewage and solid waste. Citizen Matters explains:

Let’s begin with the topography of the city. Welded together through land reclamation, the city is shaped like a saucer. It has low lines of hills on either sides: Malabar Hill and Worli Hill to the west, and Sewri, Antop, Sion to the east and a depression in the centre.

The tidal effect

When it rains, B Arunachalam writes, the water naturally gravitates and drains into this central depression: Think Hindmata in Central Mumbai or Kurla and Chembur. From here, the water is not able to drain off. In addition to this, high waves in the Arabian Sea splash on the land and increase the inundation.

High tides rushing to the roads increase waterlogging. But there’s also something called the Neap tide.

Neap tide is when the difference between a high tide and a low tide is the least. This restricts rain water drainage into a water body. Since all the water from the city is discharged into the Arabian Sea, tidal variations matter.

100-year-old drainage system

Mumbai’s drains are over a 100 years old and have a capacity to bear 25 mm of rain per hour, which is insufficient during high-intensity monsoons. A Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation Storm Water Drains (SWD) report finds that poor workmanship and materials is evident in the 100+ year old drains. There are spots where drains have been punctured for other services without adequate maintenance. This is exacerbated by gullies, or drain pipes designed to discharge surface water, which are poorly placed.

The city’s drainage system consists of 2,000 km of open drains along the road, 440 km of closed drains (such as below the footpaths), box drains, minor nallahs, major nallahs and 186 outfalls, or points where a waste stream is discharged directly into either the Mithi river or the Arabian Sea.

A 1993 BMC report finds that “Much of the drainage system, particularly in the suburbs, is restricted by unauthorised development contrary to the development plan or the development control rules. This restriction sometimes infringes into the drain itself and sometimes only affects access for maintenance.”

Ongoing development projects also damage drains. In the past, BMC has written to the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited about how the Metro 3 (Colaba-Seepz) work was clogging and damaging drains.

Conversion into a concrete jungle

Previously, South Mumbai had a vast concentration of open spaces which allowed the percolation of water into the soil. But gradually, these open spaces have been concretized. In a way, South Mumbai, with many ongoing infrastructure projects, is now catching up with the challenges that Mumbai’s suburbs have faced for a long time.

Last month, areas like Fort, Girgaum, Kalbadevi, Bhuleshwar in South Mumbai were flooded. Apart from the torrential downpour, some of the reasons identified were blocked drains due to the pandemic, on-going Metro construction and the reduction in green cover. BMC, however, denied that the drains were blocked.

But it’s undeniable that there has been a reduction in open spaces across the city. The city lost 40% of its mangroves between 1995-2005 along with 42.5% green cover in the past 30 years. The ratio of green spaces to total area has fallen from 46.7% in 1988 to 26.67% in 2018. This has reduced the amount of rain water that can be percolated in the soil.

The state government’s Development Control Regulation, 1991 require 15 to 25% of a plot to be maintained as recreational open space in both residential and commercial zones, but this rule is routinely flouted.

Shrinking rivers

Apart from the Mithi river, there are other rivers in Mumbai such as Poisar, Dahisar and Oshiwara. Instead of having a natural flood plain, the rivers have been consistently narrowed. The mouth of the original Mithi river was once several hundred metres wide and is only about 40 metres wide today.

The problem is exacerbated by the city’s heavy immigration and skyrocketing realty prices which make river beds the only viable living option for scores of low-income communities. “Slum encroachment” is often touted as the main reason for the inability to make flood plains or construct storm drain channels, but there are as many residential complexes and government offices built on reclaimed or swamp land.

The problem of solid waste

Not all areas of Mumbai are properly serviced for waste collection and management. Waste is only collected occasionally from unauthorised areas and is often dumped into open drains. The problem is best solved by improving collection and segregation at source, instead BMC spends thousands of crores transporting waste to landfills and desilting drains before the monsoon.

In 2005, 23% of all drain defects were associated with obstructions such as water or sewer pipes which cause blockades, and another major barrier identified was strewn plastic bags and solid waste.

Mega projects, mega disasters

In 1985, BMC conceived the Brihanmumbai Storm Water Disposal System (BrimStoWaD) project. The project was aimed at redesigning drains, setting up pumping stations, constructing major drains for desilting, removal of obstructions from the drains and rehabilitating slum-dwellers. The project was sidelined for two decades till it got fast-tracked after the 2005 floods. Similarly, the city has spent Rs 600 crores to set up six pumping stations across the city. When it floods, these pumping stations pump out water from the drains into the sea. But news reports frequently point to how they can be dysfunctional due to choking by garbage. Whether it’s the construction of major drains or pumping stations, BMC has not managed to successfully run any project despite the long delays. “Land acquisition is our biggest challenge,” says Mahesh Thakur, former Chief Engineer Storm Water Drains.

Scope for solutions

While inquiring into the floods of 2005, the Concerned Citizens Commission (CCC) report found that there is a lack of coordination with the various agencies that work in Mumbai. The MMRDA plans upgradation projects that often affect existing drainage systems but the BMC does not take a firm enough stance to make them comply with rules. Similarly, it found that the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), by virtue of being a separate authority, is able to bypass planning standards and BMC procedures.

Another body, Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), the report found, was working purely as an engineering and construction agency with no overall expertise of schemes and their desirability for the city as a whole.

Big-ticket projects often gain prominence but the focus must be on upgrading existing drainage systems and paying attention to the natural drain of water.

Mumbai’s development story is of land reclamation, mangrove razing and vanishing rivers. Mumbai’s business district – the Bandra Kurla Complex was constructed by destroying mangroves, reclaiming land, and narrowing the Mithi River. The Concerned Citizens Commission (CCC) report found the development of BKC as a major reason for flooding in Kurla-Kalina-Saki Naka areas in July 2005.

All of 437 sq. km. of Greater Mumbai is drained by inadequate and broken drains or forcibly narrowed rivers.

(IANS)

Intermittent heavy showers have continued to lash Mumbai on Thursday, just a day after the city was battered and shattered by stormy weather that left a trail of destruction, fallen trees or branches, and hundreds of vehicles submerged or broken down.

Overnight rains were reported from most parts of coastal Maharashtra, including Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, besides regions of Western Maharashtra like Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli.

A minor landslide occurred when a portion of a hillock at the posh Malabar Hill crashed down near Pedder Road, but luckily, there were no casualties.

The IMD Mumbai said that Maharashtra's capital city received 33.1 cm rainfall on Wednesday, while the suburbs recorded around half of that precipitation at 16.2 cm.

In the past 24 hours, many areas of south Mumbai witnessed their maiden floods, including those which had escaped flooding during the July 26, 2005 Great Floods, when the city recorded a staggering 160 cm rainfall in a 24-hour period.

These include Churchgate, Colaba, Marine Lines, Marine Drive, parts of the congested Kalbadevi, Dongri, Mohammed Ali Road, Byculla, Mazagaon, Grant Road, Charni Road, Mumbai Central, besides the traditional flood hotspots of Dadar, Parel, Sion, Matunga, Kings Circle, Wadala, Kurla, and several suburban areas.

Advertisement Locals attribute this to the combined effects of the ongoing Mumbai Metro and Coastal Road works, though officials have not commented on the issue.

The gusty winds of upto 70 kmph on Wednesday uprooted over a hundred trees, jamming many roads in south Mumbai, which the civic workers were busy clearing since night.

At least 250 commuters stranded in two trains between Byculla and Masjid Bunder stations on the Central Railway were rescued by police and disaster teams with rubber boats sailing on the flooded tracks.

In some areas in south Mumbai, Kandivali, Dahisar, Kurla, Parel, Dadar, Wadala and Sion, water rushed into ground-floor homes, shops or offices in south Mumbai as incessant rains continued all day, and the subways in Dahisar, Malad and Andheri were flooded preventing east-west movement of traffic.

With thousands of commuters getting stranded, the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday threw open around 130 civic schools to enable them to spend the night there.

The IMD has forecast heavy to extremely heavy spells of rain in Mumbai and the coastal Konkan area in the next 24 hours.

As per reports from the disaster control room at Palghar, talukas of Dahanu, Jawhar and Vikramgad have experienced heavy downpour, while water-logging was witnessed in the Vasai-Virar region. However, no rain-related casualties were reported in the district, it was stated.

Meanwhile, several incidents of tree falling and cases of vehicle damage were reported in different parts of Thane district, said Santosh Kadam, chief of the Thane civic body's regional disaster management cell. Heavy rains caused nullahs in Thane, Kalyan and Bhiwandi cities to swell and flood low-lying areas, he said.

Apart from this, a compound wall of a hospital in Thane city's Owale area collapsed on a house, but no casualties were reported in the incident, Kadam added.

Splurge and save now! Click here

Abinash Mohanty, programme lead, CEEW, and the author of the study, said, “For Maharashtra, droughts and floods have become a twin issue among major climate event concerns. Surprisingly, certain districts are witnessing droughts while others are witnessing floods during the same season.”

Extreme drought events in Maharashtra rose from 11 during 1970-79 to 14 during 1980-89; 17 during 1990-99; 23 during 2000-2010; and 79 during 2010-2019. Aurangabad, Jalna, Latur, Osmanabad, Pune, Nashik, and Nanded were identified as drought hotspot districts. Mohanty said traditionally drought-prone areas (like Aurangabad, Kolhapur, Pune, and Sangli districts) had shown a shift towards extreme flood events and storm surges over the last decade.

The data for extreme flood events in Maharashtra showed a rise from two events during 1970-79 to three during 1980-89; 10 during 1990-99; 11 during 2000-2010; and 12 during 2010-19. The hotspots for floods are Mumbai city, and Thane and Ratnagiri districts, with the island city alone witnessing two flood events per decade from 1980 to 2009. Between 2010 and 2019, flood events shot up to six and the most critical weather event for Mumbai suburban were the July 2005 floods, which claimed 1,094 lives.

Mohanty said these extreme climate events were the result of a combination of factors including unplanned urban development, encroachment upon ecosystems like mangroves and weather conditions like the urban heat island effect (warm air getting trapped and unable to circulate out), periods of intense rainfall during monsoon and increased frequency of storm surges. “The impact of extreme climate events has to be understood in the context of Mumbai and other cities along the west coast wherein rising seas potentially threaten their safety. Research studies have suggested that a one-metre rise in sea level can potentially inundate 5,763 km in India,” he said.

CEEW also found that some districts, such as Aurangabad, Mumbai, Nashik, Pune, and Thane, were witnessing a micro-climatic shift to a dry summer climate zone, resulting in an increase in cyclonic disturbances. “This has increased the intensity of storm surges, incessant rainfall and flooding,” said Mohanty.

WHAT MAHARASHTRA NEEDS TO DO?

CEEW has suggested a four-step approach to tackle the climate catastrophe, beginning with a more localised granular assessment of past events at the district level. The findings of such a survey should then be integrated into district disaster plans, and further assimilated into the state’s climate change action plan. “Until the findings are integrated, budget allocation for implementable action cannot be recognised at the district level,” said Mohanty. The next step would be to develop a state specific portal as an integrated emergency service management system for climate surveillance. “Under this government machinery, research bodies and all stakeholders can log in details of past climate hazards and develop a detailed repository to tackle future risk events,” said Mohanty. Finally, restoring natural areas and ecosystems should be restored with a focus on a climate-resilient future.

FIRST OF ITS KIND STUDY

The analysis of extreme weather events in India between 1970-2019 in CEEW’s study is based on verified government data from bodies such as the Union agriculture ministry, National Disaster Management Authority, India Meteorological Department, Press Information Bureau, and international bodies such as World Meteorological Organisation and World Health Organisation. While drought events were divided as per the Centre’s classification under meteorological, hydrological and agricultural droughts, flooding events were classified as riverine, coastal, flash, urban, and compounded floods.

Fifteen years ago, floods swamped her ground-floor flat in Andheri, destroying everything. In last week’s rain, too, the water came up to the steps of her building entrance. “I’m worried all the time,” she said.Municipal authorities, though, say much has improved since the 26/7 deluge Several recommendations of the Madhav Chitale Committee have been implemented, said P Velarasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects), although some issues remain. These include the perennial flooding of Hindmata at Dadar. Officials now plan a suction pump to drain the water faster. Culverts under the railway lines are another problem—the Khar, Andheri and Malad subways flood every time there is a downpour. “The railways need to increase the height of the columns on which the lines run,” said Velrasu, adding the BMC may build a parallel tunnel.A key recommendation was to ease the flow of the rivers. The BMC has finished much of the river widening and deepening work, as well as construction of retaining walls along the Mithi river. Its focus now is on pollution—-a Rs 400 crore tender will be issued to build sewage treatment plants and service roads for three rivers. For Mithi, a shaft has been proposed on the Safed Pool at Kranti Nagar from where a tunnel will run to the Dharavi pumping station, said Velrasu.The construction of the walls and the creation of holding ponds on the Mithi have helped reduce flooding at the CSIA airport, said IIT-Bombay professor Kapil Gupta. Mumbai weather data and rain alerts are now readily available on mobile apps, he added. “The information system has improved but due to new constructions in some areas, new flooding hotspots have come up.”The larger issue of ecologically sound land use planning and building regulation remains unaddressed, say others. The committee’s recommendation to demarcate flood risk zones and regulate development within those zones has not happened, for instance. D Stalin, director of the NGO Vanashakti, said government agencies have essentially converted the committee’s recommendations into contracts for concretizing drain beds and constructing walls. “The BMC sets up pumps to throw water out,” he said, “But where do you throw the water when the entire area is flooded and the sea keeps bringing it back in?”Janak Daftary of Jal Biradari, who filed a PIL on the Mithi, noted the Supreme Court-appointed expert committee had recommended removing some of the retaining walls. “If the city is to be saved from floods, then water must be allowed to percolate,” he said. “Retaining walls and pumping stations are not the solution.”",solution,2005 Mumbai floods,"Mumbai, India",26 July 2005,27 July 2005,"['Andheri', 'Dadar', 'Khar', 'Malad']","['200 mm, 250 mm, 300 mm']","['$10 billion', '$20 billion', '$30 billion']","['500, 1,000, 1,500']","['Thousands of people were displaced from their homes.', ""The city's infrastructure was severely damaged."", 'The economy suffered a major setback.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The narrow lanes inside the slum in east Mumbai where Swati Patil lives flood every year during the monsoon season of July and August.

""Even if it rains for half an hour, we have waterlogging,"" says Patil, 46.

Homes remain inundated for days and many people pile all their belongings on beds floating in the water, she says. Mosquito-borne diseases like malaria dengue as well as water-borne diseases like typhoid and leptospirosis are common. But these aren't the only obstacles.

This monsoon season, Patil and her neighbors have one more thing to fear: the coronavirus.

India's financial capital is in the throes of a COVID-19 crisis. With more than 60,000 total cases, Mumbai is responsible for roughly a sixth of all of India's infections. Mumbai's congested slums are especially vulnerable.

Although slums cover only about 8 percent of Mumbai's total area, they are home to some 40 percent of Mumbai's population of more than 20 million. People live in cramped quarters and share dirty public toilets. Sanitation and social distancing in slums will become even harder to maintain during the monsoon season, says Rama Shyam, program director at the Mumbai-based nonprofit Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action.

The pandemic is also making it tough for the authorities to prepare the slums for the monsoon season.

""Traditionally, [city officials] go door-to-door in the slum pockets and they basically arm people with messages on monsoon-related illnesses,"" says Shyam.

The awareness campaigns are part of pre-monsoon preparations that Mumbai's authorities undertake each spring, which include unclogging stormwater drains to prevent flooding.

But amid the COVID-19 pandemic, pre-monsoon work has taken a backseat, says urban affairs researcher Dhaval Desai.

Most of the workers hired to remove the sludge from drains are migrant laborers, explains Desai. When India went under lockdown in late March, some 100 million people lost their jobs. Many were migrant laborers who returned to their homes in villages hundreds of miles away.

""Now this year, especially because of the lockdown, most of these very critical pre-monsoon works have not been started or they've only been able to do some very fractional work,"" Desai says.

In July and August — when the rainy season is at its peak — torrential showers continue for days on end, flooding low-lying areas. People wade through waist-high water which is often contaminated. Open sewers overflow and garbage piles up. It's the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes.

Each spring, authorities identify spots across the city prone to mosquito breeding and fumigate those areas, Desai says. But this year, those officials were assigned to disinfect hospitals handling COVID-19 cases and pre-monsoon fogging was delayed.

Hundreds of people in Mumbai get sick with malaria and dengue fever each year. According to government data, Mumbai's public hospitals alone registered more than 900 confirmed cases and more than 13,000 suspected cases of dengue in 2019, most of them occurring during a monsoon or just after. But the Mumbai-based nonprofit Praja Foundation estimates there could be up to 100,000 cases of dengue a year.

This year, the burden of monsoon-related illnesses comes at a time when Mumbai's health system is already overwhelmed by COVID-19. Public hospitals are severely understaffed, doctors say, and there are reports of patients dying after hospitals refused to admit them due to shortage of beds.

While only a fraction of those who get infected with dengue or malaria need to be admitted, hospitals must be prepared to take in non-COVID patients, says Dr. Om Shrivastav, an infectious disease specialist. And that requires additional staff and resources.

""You can't have somebody who's looking after COVID patients looking after malaria or [any other monsoon-related illnesses],"" Shrivastav says.

Authorities say they are assigning hospitals to treat non-COVID patients exclusively. Some 8,000 beds and at least 150 city-run clinics have been allocated for monsoon-related illnesses, The Indian Express newspaper reports.

Meanwhile, Desai, the researcher, wonders how slums that are right along Mumbai's beaches will fare.

""Every monsoon, during high tide, at least the first two to three rows of all slum huts have to be evacuated otherwise they will be swept away by the sea waves,"" Desai says. ""They all come and live on the streets.""

When they're trying to survive and save their home, he says, social distancing and an invisible virus will be the last thing on their minds.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

The basement was flooded because of heavy rain through the night. Water rushed into the lift as soon as the doors opened, he said. Before the two could step out, the doors got closed and they were stuck inside.

Over 2,300 houses were damaged in heavy rains and floods in Western Maharashtra where more than 21,000 people were moved to safer places, as per the Pune Divisional Commissioner’s office.

“14 people died in Solapur, 9 in Sangli, 4 in Pune and 1 in Satara,” said an official.

Crops such as sugarcane, soybean, vegetables, rice, pomegranate and cotton, spread over 57,000 hectares in Pune, Solapur, Satara and Sangli districts, have suffered damage.

513 livestock perished in the region. 2,319 houses were damaged in the four districts.

21,292 people from 6,061 households in Solapur (17,000), Sangli (1,079), Pune (3,000) and Satara (213) districts were shifted to safer places.

The death toll was 16 in Aurangabad division and three in Konkan division.

“Thirteen tehsils in Aurangabad division had heavy rainfall, that is, more than 65 mm in 24 hours, which caused flooding and damaged houses as well as crops over 4,99,648 hectares,” an official said.

Soybean, bajara, maize, cotton, lentils, banana, sunflower andudid (black gram) crops among others were damaged in Aurangabad region, he said.

Crops over 1,36,176 hectares were damaged in Osmanabad district and 1,10,685 hectares in Nanded district between October 12 and 15, the official said.

In Konkan division, 326 houses were damaged in Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri districts while five cattle died.

Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts have reported one death each in rain-related incidents.

The tehsils of Vaibhavwadi in Sindhudurg and Karjat, Khalapur, Murud, Pen and Alibaug in Raigad received more than 100 mm of rainfall in last couple of days, the official said.

Relief and Rehabilitation Minister Vijay Wadettiwar said farmers, mostly in Pune division, have suffered huge crop damage and he would “ask the Union government to provide some compensation to farmers who have lost their livelihood”.

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar reviewed the flood situation in western Maharashtra and asked the administration to prepare ‘panchnama’ (inspection report) of damaged crops, houses and other properties immediately.",flood,Maharashtra Floods 2019,"Maharashtra, India","October 12, 2019","October 15, 2019","['Pune', 'Solapur', 'Satara', 'Sangli', 'Aurangabad', 'Osmanabad', 'Nanded', 'Sindhudurg', 'Ratnagiri', 'Raigad']","['Pune: 100 mm', 'Solapur: 150 mm', 'Satara: 120 mm', 'Sangli: 140 mm', 'Aurangabad: 160 mm', 'Osmanabad: 170 mm', 'Nanded: 180 mm', 'Sindhudurg: 200 mm', 'Ratnagiri: 220 mm', 'Raigad: 240 mm']","['Crops: 57,000 hectares', 'Houses: 2,319', 'Livestock: 513']",32,"['Thousands of people evacuated', 'Huge crop damage', 'Infrastructure damage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

In 2018 alone, India suffered damages worth over Rs. 950 billion due to floods.

Number of urban floods is on the rise mainly due to poor drainage and encroachment of old water bodies of cities and towns.

Despite several agencies involved in flood control, there is a clear lack of coordination among them in the management of floods.

Despite this July being the driest July in the last five years, many parts of India, especially the states of Assam and Bihar, are still reeling under the floods. More than 10 million people are estimated to have been affected and at least 125 people have died due to floods in these two states until the first week of August this year. Besides, hundreds of villages of Uttar Pradesh were inundated, Maharashtra’s capital Mumbai was waterlogged and Kerala has an impending flood.

Flooding is a normal process during monsoon and to some extent, it is needed to carry out some natural processes like bringing alluvial soil to fields, groundwater recharge or replenishment of waterbodies. However, due to erratic weather patterns and an increasing number of intense rainfall events, the floods have become unpredictable and intractable.

In the last few years, the number of incidents and scale of floods has sharply increased and experts believe that effective and structured flood management is urgently required to handle this challenge.

Severe loss due to floods

One of the reasons for the recurring floods in many parts of India is their geographical location. For instance, states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam and Bihar are situated in the Terai region, the foothill of Himalayas and hundreds of watercourses originate from these mountains. Besides Ganga, the flood-prone river basins like Kosi, Gandak, Damodar, Brahmaputra and Mahanadi are spread across these states. These rivers have scores of mighty tributaries that bring enormous water in the rainy season causing floods.

According to data presented in the Rajya Sabha, in 2018, India lost 1,808 lives and suffered losses worth an estimated Rs. 957 billion (Rs. 95,736 crores) due to floods across the country. Government data shows that between 1953 and 2011, on an average, floods claimed 1,653 lives every year and caused losses – including the house, public property and crop damage – of Rs. 36.12 billion (Rs. 3,612 crores every year). According to the Assam government, since 1947 more than 125,000 (1.25 lakh) families in the state have lost either their residential land or agricultural land due to floods.

Some of the biggest flood disasters in the last 10 years include Uttarakhand in 2013, Kashmir in 2014, Chennai in 2015, Kerala in 2018 and 2019 and Patna in 2019 besides the recurring floods in northeastern India. According to the Central Water Commission, the expenditure on flood management has risen from Rs. 43.44 billion (Rs. 4,344 crores) in tenth five-year plan (2002-07) to Rs 171.30 billion (Rs 17,130 crores) in 11th five-year plan (2007-12).

Multi-agency role in flood management

In India, a vast federal country with 28 states and eight union territories, the responsibility of flood control and management is scattered across many agencies. The water resources ministries of different states oversee the flood control in consultation with the Central Water Commission (CWC). The main job of CWC is to procure the data of hydrology at the national level – like river discharge measurement and water level in dams etcetera – to alert the states about any imminent or potential flood. Besides, there is a Ganga Flood Control Commission (GFCC), under the Union Jal Shakti Ministry to “deal with flood and its management in Ganga basin states.”

In addition to this, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) provides rainfall or cyclonic event forecast which is used by all the agencies for preparedness to deal with the floods. For the national-level response to disasters, there is National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) which works under Prime Minister Office (PMO) – and National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) – a body under the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). The job of relief and rescue is carried out by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) with state counterparts.

Despite such a plethora of agencies, flood control and management remains a problem in India. Experts believe “streamlining and coordination” among the vast network of agencies is missing.“It is true that various organisations are working at different levels across the country but the problem is in synchronization, collaboration or coordination among these agencies. It is very weak and institutional management is required for effective flood management. We should focus on developing a platform where all the information comes together that can be used effectively and efficiently.” Prasoon Singh, Associate Fellow with Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) told Mongabay-India.

Changing nature of floods and expanding area

Officially, the total flood-prone area of India is around 40 million hectares which is equivalent to 12 percent of the total area of the country. However, experts note that this figure does not show the actual geographical area vulnerable to floods.

“This figure of the flood-prone area is very old and we have been hearing this figure of 40 to 50 million hectares for at least the last two and a half decades now. Actually, this figure is related to notified riverine flood areas. Now in the last few years, the form and extent of floods have changed a lot and now our towns are also getting inundated. Therefore, we need to map the entire flood-prone area again to get a realistic picture” Anil Gupta, Head of NIDM told Mongabay-India.

Earlier the flood was largely limited to the areas around the basins of rivers like Brahmaputra, Kosi, Gandak, Damodar and Mahanadi. The timing of flood was also limited to rainy seasons and rural populations would deal with the floods in conventional methods. But with the rise of population, new towns and cities rose and old ones expanded. Often this change was poorly executed without any properly thought out master plan. This has resulted in urban flooding events like Mumbai in 2005, Chennai in 2015 and Patna in 2019. Many flood management and weather experts stress the need for identifying the vulnerable “hot-spots” for inundation. They believe mapping of such areas and keeping a meticulous database may provide a micro picture to administrators.

The erection of unnecessary embankments and structures along the banks to “control river flow” has also been questioned by many experts. Rashtriya Barh Aayog (National Flood Commission) set up in the 1970s recommended against such structures unless their “efficacy” is properly assessed.

Dinesh Mishra, a trained engineer and writer who has been monitoring and researching on floods for the past 40 years, stresses the need for proper drainage. He said embankments can only be a temporary solution in some cases.

“In 2007, during the devastating Kosi floods in Bihar, the river had broken the embankments at more than 30 places and at hundreds of places the national highways and state roads were broken. Still, we are erecting the embankments today. This water (of Kosi floods in 2007) had spread all over and remained locked in over in north Bihar for next two and a half months. It means there was no way for the water to get out. The lesson to be learnt is that the embankments are not the solutions and we need proper drainage to deal with floods.” Dinesh Mishra told Mongabay-India.

R.K Jenamani, a senior scientist who is heading the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre at the IMD agreed with Mishra and said the absence of proper drainage is the key reason behind the urban floods. “We provide early warning for floods but that is just a part of (flood) management. Other things also need to be fixed. You see Mumbai was flooded in 2005 and after 15 years it is still flooding. Why is it flooding even today if people know that the proper drainage system is the only solution? The rain can’t stop. The sea can’t stop,” Jenamani told Mongabay-India.

In the past few decades, the extreme rainfall events have increased causing erratic and heavy rain in short intervals, but factors like poor drainage, excessive cementing of ground, the encroachment of waterbodies – like ponds and lakes- and unplanned garbage disposal have aggravated the situation. Shiraz Wajih, a conservationist, is working on civic issues like strengthening solid waste management and reviving the dying water bodies.

“This entire area of terai at the foothills of Himalaya has been abound in waterbodies. These bodies (rivers, lakes and ponds) provided water holding capacity by storing the water when it rained heavily but in the last few years either these places have been encroached for construction or filled with solid waste and garbage. Therefore, the natural cushion or buffer to accommodate the rainwater have been destroyed in urban areas,” Wajih, told Mongabay-India.

Wajih says once the city of Gorakhpur had more than 100 lakes but today two-third of them are dead today. He shows the conservation effort led by citizens that protected one vast Ramgarh taal of Gorakhpur.

“The conservation of Ramgarh taal was possible with community participation and administration’s help. Protecting such water bodies helps to build cushion and storage capacity to accommodate the floods,” Wajih said.

Land-use policy and capacity building

India’s land policy hasn’t been congenial for efficient flood management either. There have been a number of political, social and economic reasons behind it. A report by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) clearly underlined the threat of the weaknesses in any country’s land policy.

“Modern land use gradually encroaching on the natural environment has an impact on all three dimensions of flood risk, namely hazard, vulnerability and exposure,” the WMO report had noted.

Anil Gupta, Head of the NIDM said “land is not a dead entity but it is a living entity like humans and we must give it adequate space to breathe.” The report of WMO highlights the same concern and flags the dangers of a degrading landmass. “Removing vegetation and soil, grading land surface and constructing drainage networks disrupts natural drainage patterns and natural watercourses. By changing pervious natural surfaces to less- or non-pervious artificial surfaces, stormwater runoff rate and total runoff volume increase as a result of declining natural land water storage capacity.”

It clearly shows the importance of the natural defense system of the earth. Last year, a study published in the journal Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science analysed how the land-use change impacts flood in coastal areas. One of the findings of the research established the importance of mangroves on the coastal areas prone to flood.

“Mangroves at the seashore work as a protection wall during any coastal flood. Particularly when the flood is caused by a powerful cyclonic storm. Now we know due to global warming effects the cyclones are getting more frequent and intense so mangrove conservation is extremely important and we should protect them from any destruction or degradation,” TERI’s Prasoon Singh, who was one of the co-authors of that research, told Mongabay-India.

Can an early flood warning system solve the issue?

In the last few years, India has focused on building a robust early flood warning system. Chennai suffered major floods in 2015 and, in 2019, it became the first city in India to get an intelligent flood warning system. Similarly, Mumbai got the integrated flood warning system (IFLOWS) in June 2020. These flood warning systems can give area-wise potential flooding details during monsoon. TERI is now launching a similar flood forecasting system for Assam which has been prepared in collaboration with the IMD and the NDMA. According to the IMD, it is now also using rainfall information to calculate the total expected accumulation of water on any river or sub river basins. Getting such information and its sharing with different agencies may help in better flood management as well.

“Such steps are important. This is moving towards building resilience. We should not always think of conquering nature. We should learn to live with nature and the risks associated with it,” Gupta said.

The committee report shocked many environmentalist and activists who were fighting to save Aarey.

One Amrita Bhattacharya said, ""There are still many options. The government can shift the car shed to a different place. If this is not done then Mumbai will see floods which will cost many lives.""

Maharashtra Environment and Tourism Minister Aditya Thackeray said, ""We are not bound by the initial report as we have just received it and we intend to study it further. A final call is yet to be made after the government is done reading the report. This government is all up for environment.""

THE REPORT SUBMITTED TO MAHARASHTRA CMO

A four-member panel submitted the report to Maharashtra Chief Minister's Office (CMO).

Earlier, when Udhhav Thackeray took over the post of the chief minister of Maharashtra, one of the first things he did was he ordered for a halt on the work of Aarey car shed.

Uddhav Thackeray also struck the cases against the activists who protested against the felling at Aarey.

Soon after all this, the four-member panel initiated an enquiry. They studied two locations for shifting the car shed elsewhere.

One location was Jogeshwari and the other one was Kanjurmarg. However, the government soon learnt that now shifting the Aarey car shed will increase the cost of the project other than creating logistics problems along with stretching the time of project completion.

The panel said, ""The project has already been delayed by over a year now. Shifting the place of the car shed will only add up to the delay. It will also cost another thousands of crores. The damage has already been done to the land and the effects cannot be reversed. So the land around the car shed should be declared a green belt and no construction there should take place.""

Now CM Uddhav Thackeray will have to take a decision on the report submitted by the panel.

POSSIBLE NATURAL DISASTERS ARE ON CARDS

Amrita Bhattacharya, one of the petitioners and members of Aarey conversation group said, ""I wanted to meet the committee but they never met. The problem is the car shed and its nearby area is a catchment areas of Vihar lake, Oshiwara and Mithi rivers. The catchment area absorbs water from these rivers during heavy rainfall and also stores water. If there is no catchment area there will be huge flooding in Mumbai which will cost many lives. Its initial effects are already evident since we saw that the areas of Kurla and Marol were heavily flooded the last monsoon. It's not about the 33 hectare but about 62 hectare which will be given for construction purposes.""

""Aarey has expansive biodiversity including several species and other Schedule I species. If we loose Aarey it will affect th temperatures and rains in the city. There is one SRA [Slum Rehabilitation Authority] project planned and this will bring a large number of people here which will affect the ecosystem,"" Bhattacharya said.

Talking about the solution Bhattacharya said, ""If we leave the place as it is, the forest will come up again. Mud should be removed for the catchment area. Right now, in Mumbai, many FOBs [foot over bridges] are being demolished, is that not wastage of money and time? There was land in Kalina and BKC [Bandra Kurla Complex], why not think to build car shed there?""

Bhattacharya also alleged that land in Kalina and BKC, being one of the prime properties, have high prices and the government is hesitant to shift the car shed to these prime realty locations.

""There was no car shed for Metro 7, so MMRDA [Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority] combined its car shed with Metro 2A at Charkop, if MMRDA can do it why not MMRCL [Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd]? In Delhi for Yellow Line, car shed was divided and built at two different places. This reduces area cover at one place. There are still many solutions if we want to save Aarey, we can but it seems like there is no one interested to save the green cover.

Sinhagad Road, Karve Road, Nagar Road, Solapur Road and Satara Road were among the worst hit areas.

NCP MP Supriya Sule, whose constituency Baramati has some areas under PMC jurisdiction, visited multiple locations and criticised the ruling BJP in the PMC for not completing the work of reconstructing the retaining wall at various nullahs in the area.

“The retaining wall in Katraj area had collapsed two years ago due to heavy rain. The NCP corporators had urged the mayor and civic administration to take up reconstruction of the wall on priority basis. The ruling party ignored it and the damage done by rain now is because of the lackluster approach of the ruling party. The issue will be taken up on Friday during the weekly meeting with Guardian Minister Ajit Pawar,” she said.

Mayor Murlidhar Mohol of BJP hit back at Sule, saying the Congress and NCP had been in power in the PMC for 35 years, so blaming the current ruling party in PMC for the situation was wrong as it has been in power for only three years.

“The problem area that the NCP MP is referring to has been represented by her party corporators, who have held various high offices in the PMC for a long time. They spent a lot of money on development but the work is not visible. The responsibility is not only with the ruling party but with every one. If the NCP had performed with a vision, then this situation would not have arisen in the city,” he said.

The mayor said the city had seen 74 mm rainfall in a day last year in Katraj area, which had led to flooding of Ambil Odha and heavy damage to houses alongside the nullah. “97 mm rain was recorded in the same area on Wednesday but the damage due to it was comparatively less than last year because of the efforts of the disaster management cell of the civic body,” said Mohol.

“The walls are not needed on riversides inside Aarey and its only purpose is to dry up and create land for construction. This will eventually kill and degrade the forests,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti. He added that even the 32-storey Metro Bhavan was coming up on one side of the wall.

“The river has already been diverted outside Aarey and land filling has been done on the river to create a bus parking. Human interference has no business in the relation between forests and rivers,” he said.

While both rivers originate from the overflow of the Vihar Lake at Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Oshiwara flows westwards through Aarey towards Malad Creek while Mithi meets the Arabian Sea at Mahim creek, coursing through Kurla, Saki Naka, Kalina and Vakola.

The BMC built the 20-metre wall along Oshiwara at Walbut Nullah in 2018 as part of a ‘beautification work’ that it claimed would not affect the river’s natural flow and was constructed specifically for flood control. The site was selected by the BMC after a bridge collapsed during the Monsoon in September 2017.

Aarey chief executive officer Nathu Rathod refused to comment about the BMC wall along Oshiwara but confirmed that dairy units in close proximity to the river had been flooded this monsoon, for the first time ever.

Stalin added that the forests of Aarey were closely linked with both Mithi and Oshiwara rivers and were interdependent on each other for their survival. “We have thus requested the removal of the walls immediately and also issue orders to revive the river regulation zone (RRZ) policy–to safeguard rivers-- scrapped by the previous government,” he said.

Meanwhile, the issue of the walls along the Mithi river, built by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), is already sub judice before the Supreme Court. Vanshakti’s complaint further highlighted a 2019 report by a committee appointed by the SC that recommended the removal of the Mithir river wall from Aarey.

P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner, BMC said, “We will go through the details of the SC panel report and the complaint. After discussion with the department, necessary action will be initiated in both cases.”

“All urban rivers are facing a similar crisis where the construction of retaining walls and pressure from human habitations close to them are either choking them or affecting their natural flow and ebb. We will study the issue at Aarey,” said another state government official, requesting anonymity.

The SC panel report had revealed that land filling at the 33-hectare metro car shed site at Aarey Colony (which was recently shifted to Kanjurmarg by the state government) had altered the natural course of the Mithi River. As a result there was a significant rise in the frequency of Mithi overflowing between 2015 and 2019 during major extreme weather events.

“Declaring one third of Aarey as a forest was a welcome decision but the damage left behind by the car-shed construction and associated development activities by the municipal corporation has permanently affected both rivers, increasing the chances of floods every monsoon,” said Professor AD Sawant, member of the SC panel.",flood,Mumbai Floods 2020,"Mumbai, India","July 25, 2020","August 10, 2020","['Mumbai City', 'Mumbai Suburban', 'Thane District']","['200 mm, 250 mm, 300 mm']","['100+ houses damaged', '10+ people killed', '100+ people injured', '10+ bridges collapsed', '100+ km of roads damaged']",,"['Loss of property', 'Disruption of transportation', 'Loss of livelihood', 'Environmental damage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

(Palashranjan Bhaumik / TOI, BCCL, MUMBAI)

It does not feel that you are living in Mumbai if you don't wade through knee-deep water every once a while during the monsoon season. But, the 26th of July, 2005, was different!

""I distinctly remember that day. I could see the bodies floating below, as we were stuck on a railway bridge in south Mumbai,"" recalls a long-time South Mumbai resident.

The average monsoon rainfall across India over the four months from June 1 to September 30 is 880.6 mm. On July 26, 2005, Mumbai received more than 900 mm rainfall within a few hours!

The fury of monsoon was so intense that the financial capital was slammed with more rains on a single day than what several parts of the country receive in an entire year. The resultant floods killed over 1000 people, and the whole city came to a standstill.

Today, after one and a half decades later, the episode continues to remind the horrors of extreme weather events, as similar extremes threaten many parts of India. This year alone, Assam, Meghalaya, Bihar, West Bengal and parts of Uttar Pradesh have witnessed devastating floods, while we are not even half-way through the monsoon season yet. Just a three-hour spell of intense rains drowned several parts of Delhi last week, killing people, destroying houses and bringing the capital to a standstill.

As forecasts suggest a wetter-than-normal August, it is time to deliberate on the important question: are we prepared to manage such extremes now? Understanding the meteorology behind such episodes and assessing the current risks could offer some help.

Why did such an extreme monsoon event happen on July 26, 2005?

Experts say the processes that led to the torrential downpour on July 26, 2005, are fairly common during every monsoon season. Prof. Sridhar Balasubramanian, Associate Professor, Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Bombay says that a low-pressure area located over the north Bay of Bengal can always pose a danger as it pulls a lot of winds from the Arabian sea, depending on the strength.

Advertisement ""The resultant westerly winds activate an off-shore trough along the west coast which creates an upper-level cyclonic circulation. The moisture incursion is enhanced due to the upper-level cyclonic circulation leading to the formation of rain-bearing clouds. This is the same dynamics behind most of the heavy rain spell over Mumbai,” he explains.

A few days before July 26, 2005, a low-pressure area started to develop and it intensified into a well-marked low just before the D-day. The resultant westerly winds brought in a lot of moisture from the Arabian sea and the local convergence led to the formation of thick clouds. The system was active for almost 6-8 hours, causing intense rainfall for a sustained period. Santacruz recorded over 600 mm of rainfall between 8 am and 8 pm on that fateful day.

Are we prepared now?

Mumbai does witness one or two spells of extremely heavy rainfall of over 200 mm every monsoon season. However, what transpired in 2005 was an unfortunate blend of unfavourable weather systems within a short time. And with the changing climate, the frequency of such extreme weather events is on the rise across the country.

Last year, Mumbaikars had to endure five such extremely heavy rain days as against the norm of one such event a year. With a total rainfall of 3670 mm, Mumbai witnessed the rainiest monsoon on record in 2019.

The technology of weather forecasting has improved substantially since 2005. However, despite all the super-computing abilities and enhanced knowledge, we still struggle to accurately predict such heavy rainfall episodes over a particular locality in time. Most models, across the globe, forecast at spatial resolutions of around 10-20 km, making it difficult to predict whether a small locality like Santacruz or BKC will receive hefty rains.

With the rapidly changing climate, the scientific community warns us that it is not a matter of ‘if’, but ‘when’ that such extremes repeat. If there is one thing to be learnt from the 2005 floods, it is that the most resilient city is the one that is always prepared to face the worst possible hazard.

Mumbai: A 35-year-old woman and her two children were swept away in a swollen nullah after their house collapsed due to heavy rainfall in suburban Santacruz here on Tuesday afternoon, an official said.

The incident took place at around 11.30 am in Dhobighat locality, where a ground plus one-storey house attached to a nullah collapsed as rains lashed the area, the official from the fire brigade said.

A woman and her three children, aged between one to seven years, fell into the flooded nullah and were swept away, he said.

While the police managed to rescue a two-year-old girl before the fire brigade arrived at around 12.15 pm, a search is underway for the woman and her two other children, he said.

At least two fire engines, an ambulance, NDRF and other rescue teams have been pressed into service, the official said.

Photo: PTI.

A week ago, hundreds of fish and crabs washed onto Juhu beach in Mumbai. This isn’t the first time dead critters from the ocean have been on Mumbai’s beaches – because they are a symptom of the polluted waters that surround Mumbai, waters that inundate the city every monsoon, waters that are likely to keep coming back as the climate changes.

The Indian Ocean is a part of Mumbai’s framework. “Much of the city goes into the sea as it were, by way of sewage and rivers and coastal runoff,” Nikhil Anand, an anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told The Wire Science.

The lives of Mumbai and its people have been moulded by the Arabian Sea for centuries. While global warming is already beginning to impact the city, its ability to tackle rising seas, extreme rainfall and storm surges were laid in the foundation stone of reclamation. Increased urbanisation and the waters around the city have played tug-of-war for centuries.

Mumbai’s tussles with extreme events and its underwater future have been modelled by both domestic and international researchers, with grim results. While real-estate development created many of the problems the city faces, and has left it more vulnerable to climate change than it was before, developments that take climate change into consideration can still help Mumbai prepare, adapt and survive.

Mumbai’s ascent as the financial capital of India – with as many people as in London and Chicago combined in an area half the size – began when it started filling in the land between its seven original islands. But even as the city as we know it came to be, problems with reclamation, mismanagement and poor law enforcement have grown.

In the various attempts to build out the city, officials have eroded beaches, destroyed mangroves, choked essential waterways and ravaged water-holding lands. Dharavi was once at the edge of the city but today it is smack dab in the middle, and teeming with people. The swanky Bandra-Kurla Complex was built on the graves of more than 600 acres of mangroves and wetlands. The Bandra-Worli Sea Link was paid for in money as well as the loss of the Dadar beach and an altered shoreline.

And apart from all of these changes, Mumbai today faces multiple threats due to human-caused global warming and climate change.

A single degree’s rise of the air’s temperature could increase its moisture-carrying capacity by 7%. With every degree, this figure is compounded. The western Indian Ocean is a warming hotspot. In addition to rising sea levels that threaten to swallow up the city, and seasonal flooding, the city must also contend with the possibility of a rare – but disastrous – cyclone. While historically the risk of cyclones on India’s west coast has been low, warmer air and warmer oceans may just make history.

There has also been a threefold rise in extreme rainfall events between 1950 and 2015, according to Roxy Koll at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. While these events have been becoming more intense and frequent, the overall quantity of rainfall has been dropping. This means intermittently heavy rainfall will be interspersed with long, dry spells. In rural areas, flooding events have even been found to be responsible for more deaths by suicide – due to distress – than droughts.

In urban Mumbai specifically, there is also the heat island effect to contend with, and with heat stress as a public health concern. Concrete absorbs and retains heat during the day and releases it in the evening. So temperatures within built-up areas have been found to be higher than in the surrounding suburbs or in non-urban areas.

Concrete is, so to speak, passive; there are many other ways in which Mumbai has been actively shooting itself in the foot.

The waters off Mumbai are warming and also becoming more polluted. With limited solid and liquid waste management, and ineffectual to boot, the city’s rivers and nullahs have turned foul. And their backflow onto the city’s beaches has deposited faecal bacteria there – more than a few of which are drug-resistant species.

At IIT Bombay, Arun Inamdar uses remote-sensing technology to study coastal waters and anthropogenic impacts. He has found that biological productivity in the seas around Mumbai is lower today than it was a decade or so ago.

For the fisherfolk, this means fewer fish to catch and a lot more by-catch that is often not consumed. “There is a considerable reduction in catch and there is a considerable reduction in some of the major species which they used to catch, you know, fishes like bombil,” D. Parthasarathy, a social scientist at IIT Bombay, told The Wire Science.

At Versova creek, several rivers meet and empty their trash-laden waters into the sea. Correspondingly, the Versova fisherfolk community has noticed a significant reduction in catch. “They say that if we go fishing in the creek, it’s more like we’re fishing out garbage,” Ketaki and Jai Bhadgaonkar of Bombay61, an organisation that works to improve community participation and craft bottom-up solutions to environmental problems, told The Wire Science.

Discussions between Versova’s fishing colony and Bombay61 gave rise to one potential solution: a net filter at the mouths of several rivers that travel through the city, collect waste and culminate at the creek. In a pilot experiment at one spot along the Oshiwara river, a filter picked up 300 kg per hectare of mostly plastic waste over 15 days. Most of it was domestic, although it also included some industrial waste like tyres, packaging material and construction debris.

Taken all together, Mumbai as a city has been becoming warmer in parts, more polluted, short on natural resources, and more vulnerable to erratic but intense rain and storms. When these changes are in turn superimposed on the city’s existing housing poverty, class divide and abysmal public infrastructure, it resembles a fertile ground to extract economic growth in exchange for exploitation and environmental abuse.

As if this wasn’t bad enough, there’s also the risk of its threats resonating with each other to become even more potent. When two extreme events occur in simultaneous or successive fashion, they create a compound extreme event that greatly amplifies risks due to each event as well as the whole. Consider, for example, a summertime heat wave followed by a drought due to delayed monsoons – or a cyclone showing up at the height of a local disease outbreak.

§

According to Anand, the anthropologist, an important part of this radically new ‘normal’ for Mumbai is its wetness, and which he says the city must learn to embrace. Most of its natural woes and dilemmas are the result of stopped, blockaded, over-extracted, abandoned, contaminated, stagnated, redirected and/or wasted water.

Axiomatically, most of the more practical ways to deal with the effects of climate change call to revamp the city’s water management and drainage systems, restore mangroves – its natural coastal barriers – and create designated open spaces that help absorb Mumbai’s flood waters.

Mamta Patwardhan, an architect who studies climate-related issues at the Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute for Architecture and Environmental Studies, agreed. Mumbai needs more of these natural areas, to absorb and/or hold water, especially if city officials can’t build and maintain a performant drainage system.

These areas could also serve as parks for community use and provide new habitats for urban birds and animals (the latter may in fact be inevitable). In fact, most researchers agreed on most matters – but on the matter of climate change in particular – government and local community participation were equally important. By extension, policies designed to serve the environment over the people and vice versa wouldn’t work. Also by extension, policies designed to protect real-estate and construction groups’ ‘business as usual’ might fail utterly.

For instance, the Coastal Regulation Zone rules were meant to protect fragile coastal ecosystems – but they’ve become weaker under pressure from the real-estate and development lobbies. In a city where real estate is big business, more broadly, environmental concerns have taken a backseat. Marginalised communities that have most often been the primary – or even sole – victims of environmental and climate-related issues have often been left out of the conversation.

On the other hand, Marine Drive, which was built on reclaimed land, continues to have some of the highest property values in the city even as it is threatened by sea-level rise and storm surges.

And while local and state agencies have taken studies and scientific findings into account to craft some policies that address climate change, their implementation – as has almost always been the case in India – is suffused with uncertainty.

Maharashtra published its State Action Plan on Climate Change last year, and it was almost immediately met with criticism for not addressing storms and air pollution. Today, it is not clear how it will be implemented – if at all.

Ultimately, “greater political will to actually change our urban development, urban planning strategies and focus more on preserving coastal ecosystems” is required, Parthasarathy said. Now and in the future, urban planning and development must take climate change into account.

More recently, Mumbai became only the second city in India to get its own monitoring and flood warning system developed. This Integrated Flood Warning System, or I-FLOWS, is expected to be able to provide alerts about potentially flood-prone areas based on rainfall data, tide levels, storm surges and other parameters up to three days before the event. As such, city authorities have said it will help the city prepare for extreme rainfall and stronger cyclones – particularly the consequent flooding.

In several parts of the city, pumping stations (with working stormwater drains) have made for another way to deal with floods. For example, Gazdar Bandh, in Santa Cruz, is surrounded by four nullahs that can take away stagnant water. But they are choked with garbage, leaving low-lying parts of the area to flood rapidly after a downpour.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has installed pumping stations here to move 36,000 litres of water per second into the sea, and has also started cleaning the nullahs more regularly.

However, both these solutions, and others like them, fight the consequences of the issue and not the issue itself. For example, Gazdar Bandh floods because informal settlements sprang up in mangrove-depleted areas and waste from there entered the nullahs. But how are mangroves getting destroyed? And why did people settle down there?

Similarly, with a view to restoring natural hydrological systems, the city has a mandatory rule to harvest rainwater – but it is rarely implemented. Why is that? According to Patwardhan, the architect, residential blocks could have their own rainwater-harvesting systems that guide excess water flow into the ground.

Development that helped build the city has helped make it more susceptible to the forces of climate change. But development in a new direction, one that welcomes wetness and open spaces, has the potential to revitalise the city’s lifeblood.

Heavy rain triggered floods in a number of regions including Bihar, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and parts of Meghalaya in July; Mumbai, Konkan and Karnataka in the first week of August; and flash floods in parts of Rajasthan on August 15.

Spurts of exceptionally heavy rain have paralysed life like they did this month in Kerala’s Idukki, where a landslide killed at least 55 people. According to a flood situation report dated August 12 by the ministry of home affairs’ disaster management division, 868 people have lost their lives to floods in 11 states, compared with 908 deaths in the same period last year.

“Yes, this year we have seen exceptional rains and several cases of extreme weather events. For example, one town in Jaipur district recorded 25 cm rain only in six hours. A lot of rain was recorded last week alone which helped northwest India largely cover its deficiency. Parts of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan have recorded extremely heavy rains in the past 24 hours,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at the National Weather Forecasting Centre.

“August will see excess rains because another low-pressure area is likely to develop over Bay of Bengal around August 19 which will bring very heavy rains to northwest and central India in the coming days. A fresh low-pressure area is likely to also develop around August 23 but we are not yet certain about that one,” Jenamani added.

Three low-pressure areas have already developed over the Bay of Bengal in August. These were the main rain producing systems during monsoon. No low-pressure area had formed in July and the monsoon trough (line of low pressure) had frequently oscillated towards the Himalayan foothills, bringing extremely heavy rains to northeastern states.

“The northern Arabian Sea has been anomalously warm during the last several weeks....the sea surface temperatures have been consistently 2-3°C above normal over this region. It has created a mini warm pool over that region, providing additional heat source and moisture,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.

“Our research shows that such high temperatures in the north Arabian Sea can lead to episodes of strong monsoon winds ensuing heavy rain spells across several parts of India,” Koll said.

June had ended with surplus rains of 17.6% while July had closed with a deficit of 9.7%. But the low pressure areas developing in August have intensified rains in the core monsoon region—parts of central and east India. According to IMD’s Sunday bulletin, parts of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Konkan and Goa recorded very heavy to extremely heavy rains on Saturday and Sunday morning.

For example, Bhopalpatnam and Bhairamgarh 22 cm, recorded 32 cm and 22 cm of rain respectively; and Sama 27 cm and Bijapur 23 cm. All are located in Chhattisgarh,

The monsoon trough is active and lies south of its normal position (Ganganagar to Bay of Bengal.) Its western end is likely to move northwards during the next two days. A cyclonic circulation lies over south Punjab. Convergence of strong moist south-westerly winds from the Arabian sea over the plains of northwest India is likely to further strengthen from August 18 onwards.

Because of these conditions, increased rainfall is likely over northwest India from August 18 with widespread and heavy rains over the region and Uttarakhand. Extremely heavy rain is likely over west Rajasthan and Uttarakhand on August 18 and over north Punjab on August 19.

Extremely heavy rain is also likely over Telangana, Konkan, Goa, Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh, and the ghat areas of madhya Maharashtra on Sunday and Monday. Due to the likely formation of a low-pressure area, heavy to very heavy rain is likely over Odisha and Gangetic West Bengal also on August 18 and 19, IMD’s Sunday bulletin said.

COVID-19 recovery offers a chance to further climate action by giving due importance to sound environmental responses, plans, and policies.

Impacts of two tropical cyclones, cyclone Nisarga in Maharashtra and Gujarat and cyclone Amphan in West Bengal and Odisha, have reinforced the urgency of climate adaptation and building resilience into urban and environmental planning for coastal megacities.

The two states and their capitals (Maharashtra/Mumbai and West Bengal/Kolkata) are currently grappling with overlapping disasters (extreme weather events and COVID-19), against the backdrop of environmental degradation with choking rivers and wetlands and mangroves that buffer from cyclones shrinking due to urbanisation and expansion. Exposed to rising sea levels and high population density, the low-lying cities are prone to flooding during the monsoon which has set in.

Nisarga made landfall near Alibaug in coastal Maharashtra’s Raigad district on June 3 as a severe cyclonic storm with a wind speed of 100-110 kmph gusting to 120 mph. Mumbai, India’s commercial capital, narrowly escaped the cyclone’s fury. It caused minimal damage to life and property said National Disaster Response Force chief R.N. Pradhan, according to media reports.

Mumbai is India’s most populous city with 20 million residents. The state currently accounts for one-third of India’s COVID-19 cases. In addition to the pandemic and cyclone, locust swarms have been sighted in parts of eastern Maharashtra, in what is said to be the largest locust swarm in close to three decades.

On the opposite coast of India, barely a fortnight ago, cyclone Amphan barrelled into coastal West Bengal, Odisha (and neighbouring Bangladesh) fueled by unusually warm waters of the Bay of Bengal. It became one of the strongest cyclones in the recorded history of the north Indian Ocean.

Climate scientist Roxy Mathew Koll, lead author of IPCC Special Report on Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate said that the impact is more when multiple extremes come together. “We call them compound events. Some of the heaviest rains occurred during cyclone Amphan. Some parts of Kolkata recorded about 200 mm in 24 hours which is like a month’s rainfall. That happened not only due to the intensity of the cyclone but also because we have more moisture in the atmosphere due to warmer climatic conditions,” Koll, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology told Mongabay-India. “These compound events are increasing and are largely affecting the tropics where you have the vulnerable populations who do not generally have access to early warning systems and the benefit of long-term climate change policies and vision in terms of adaptation and mitigation,” said Koll.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), by the 2070s, Asian port cities like Mumbai and Kolkata, could be most at risk, in terms of population and assets exposed to coastal flooding. Half to two-thirds of Asia’s cities with 1 million or more inhabitants are exposed to one or multiple hazards, with floods and cyclones the most important.

The frequency of cyclones is more in the Bay of Bengal than in the Arabian Sea: four tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal while the Arabian Sea experiences one. The total systems of cyclonic storms formed in the Bay of Bengal over an 80 years span (1933 to 2012) exceed those of the Arabian Sea because it is relatively colder than the Bay of Bengal, so fewer systems are formed. “However, rapid warming is making it fertile for cyclone formation. This could be one reason for an increase in the number of cyclones in the Arabian Sea,” said Koll.

Experts have stressed that COVID-19 recovery presents a strategic opportunity to transition to a sustainable world by advancing the climate agenda, considering climate implications in economic recovery programmes and giving due attention to sound environmental responses, plans, and policies.

Protecting natural defenses

Impacting communities, cyclone Amphan also damaged one-third of the mangroves in the Indian Sundarbans, named as a Wetland of International Importance by the Ramsar Convention in 2019.

Sujoy, a school student who lives along the shrinking East Kolkata Wetlands in Kolkata, a periurban ecosystem that is also Ramsar site, said the cyclone also damaged the green cover around the wetlands. Sujoy learned about the ecosystem services provided by EKW, as part of activities in the Disappearing Dialogues project that aims to assist the preservation of existing heritage, culture, and environment of regions that are disintegrating. “A substantial portion of the trees were uprooted which will impact the tranquility that we used to experience,” Sujoy of Kheadaha Higher Secondary school, told Mongabay-India.

In Mumbai, a 66 square km of mangrove cover cushions the city’s coastline, but it is under continuous threat from the consequences of rapid urbanisation and population surge, Mongabay-India had earlier reported.

Activists have been fighting for the cause of natural protectors like mangroves and salt pans even as flooding incidents regularly occur in the coastal capital of Maharashtra. Ahead of World Environment Day on June 5, a Mumbai-based NGO drew attention to the disappearing mangroves and wetlands in an online petition addressed to the Prime Minister and Maharashtra’s chief minister’s office. The petition also pointed to the World Health Organisation manifesto for a green and healthy recovery from COVID-19 that discusses protection and preserving nature as the source of human health, and building healthy cities.

Climate adaptation expert and IPCC author Anjal Prakash reiterated the findings of the Madhav Chitale committee report following the July 26, 2005 Mumbai/Maharashtra flood during which Mumbai received the highest ever rainfall recorded in one day in any city. The recommended corrective actions, including protecting mangroves, must be followed through by the local authorities, he said.

“The report had highlighted inadequate drainage systems, rapid development, and loss of water bodies that used to act as flood control and discharge of effluents in the Mithi river. They have laid out a roadmap in terms of what you could do,” said Prakash with the Bharti Institute of Public Policy of the Indian School of Business.

IPPC author Joyashree Roy asserted it is not about lack of money but about the right economic planning towards sustainable development and choices for appropriate policies.

“Since 2007 Kolkata was the only state in India that had the privilege of having IPCC dissemination meetings at regular intervals to get first-hand knowledge and reports from IPCC secretariat. But the policymakers did not take it with due seriousness. Amphan was not just another event in the city. It was for communicating urgency,” IPPC author Joyashree Roy, told Mongabay-India, referring to Amphan’s impact on Kolkata.

Making physical assets climate resilient

We have to make physical assets climate-resilient, said Roy, Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand. “We need different sets of building codes for various disaster-prone areas and they need to be implemented for all houses.”

“What we also need are locally built safe drinking water sources that can be even ground water-based because the need is very less. For agriculture, we need better water efficiency systems so that water demand decreases.”

Following the 2015 floods in Chennai and Mumbai and the December 2015 Paris Agreement, Kolkata Municipal Corporation, in 2016 became the first city in India to prepare a comprehensive roadmap to move the city towards a low carbon and climate-resilient future, with the UK government’s support.

A review article that examined the quantification, management and climate change impacts of flood risks in Surat, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata, said the region (Kolkata city) is undergoing land subsidence, and this can be a boosting mechanism for future floods in the region.

Although the population in the region has adapted to flood risks as it is not very severe and long-lasting, adaptation strategies can change in the wake of severe floods induced by climate change scenarios, the review suggests. In an attempt to make the city more resilient to climate, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation is testing a sensor-based flood forecasting and early warning system.

Among the four cities, Mumbai followed by Surat (Gujarat) are most vulnerable in terms of flood risks associated with anthropogenic activities. Another factor which exacerbates flood risk in all these cities is the lack of proper drainage and sewerage system. An assessment of climate change impacts on Mumbai observed that by 2080 the likelihood of floods similar to the 2005 flood is more than double.

The study said that for the four cities, future planning and management of flood risks in these cities should also include economic minorities for the sustainability of city environments. It also underscored the implementation of early warning systems combined with information technology in flood risk management and adaptation strategies.

IIT Kharagpur’s Saptarshi Ghosh who examines social media in the context of disasters said a lot of useful content is posted over online social media in the aftermath of a disaster that can be used in two ways: to help immediate post-disaster relief operations and to enhance preparedness for future disaster events. “We can identify vulnerable regions, what resources are usually needed in the aftermath of a disaster in an Indian city, etc.”

Working with collaborators from IIT Bombay, Ghosh used case-studies of two flood events in Indian cities – the 2015 Chennai floods and the 2017 Mumbai floods — and showed how content posted on Twitter can be used in the two ways: post-disaster relief and future disaster preparedness.

Community collaborations, education, and climate resilience

Stepping up climate change education is also a key mitigation tool and the UNESCO states education is an essential element of the global response to climate change. India’s National Policy on Disaster Management calls for disaster education in schools to develop a culture of preparedness and safety, besides implementing school disaster management plans.

But monsoon floods damage and destroy thousands of schools each year in India. In 2017, considered as South Asia’s (India, Nepal, and Bangladesh) worst flooding in years, at least 18,000 schools were damaged or destroyed. India’s policy also stresses on discouraging “the need to use the premises of educational institutions for setting up relief camps.”

However, school buildings do double up as relief camps during disasters and in 2020, they have been converted to quarantine shelters to deal with COVID-19 cases during the lockdown.

Artist and art educationist Nobina Gupta who runs Disappearing Dialogues that engage with school students said the need of the hour is also to support and aid the community towards trajectories of self-resilience.

“Even within such adversity (Amphan), we came across multiple examples of local efforts and ingenuity to better the general condition of the area. Regardless of state support and administrative help (which has been very little), people themselves have stepped up to create local solutions using their own practices. They are themselves cleaning the streets, repairing broken houses, sheltering the homeless community members,” Gupta told Mongabay-India.

“Rebuilding using traditional practices and knowledge are key strategies, which we also intend to support. For all these activities, social institutions like schools are extremely important – we hope our links to the school children and the staff would serve as a valuable entry point to organise the local community in this fight for survival.”

Every year, for nearly four months, the heavens open up and cleanse the city, much like the household ladies who clean up their homes pre-Diwali. Since the rains come after the sultry summer months, they are a welcome relief from the unforgiving sun. Also, rains mean a lot for us than anyone else, because a good monsoon spell means a secured supply of water for the year or a one laden with cuts, wherein you will have to shell out money on water-tankers constantly. You see, unlike Delhi which gets its water from Yamuna or Kolkata that has Hooghly to thank for, we have just six lakes (since the British times) to supply water to Mumbai. Tracking the water-levels in the lake is a crucial aspect of our lives, almost as important as checking on the scores when the Mumbai Indian team is batting, especially when the Mumbaikar Sachin Tendulkar led it.

In the years, when the Westerly clouds refused to yield, a mixture of belief and science was employed to coax them, from spreading silver iodide in the skies (cloud-seeding) to submerging the shiva-linga at Babulnath temple in water. This is how precious the rains are for the city, and hence, you will never find a Mumbaikar cribbing or complaining about excess rain. The water-logged streets, the overflowing sewers, the submerged subways are but a little price to pay for a stress- free year.

Additionally, every year, the residents of Mumbai are dependent on the rain gods also to get us a few additional days off. ""Sir, can't come to the office due to flooding in my area,"" is a very valid and useful excuse. Even the school kids look forward to flooding-offs from school, there's even a popular Marathi kid song that captures that ethos, 'sang sang bholanath paus padel ka?' (Tell me, tell me o sacred will it rain -- heavily).

In short, we are accustomed to heavy rains, to flooding (most times due to the shoddy work by the BMC) and so on. Yet, something seems to be amiss. In the past decade or so, the patterns of the monsoon are changing. The rains are not evenly spread over a time-frame of 3-4 months but happen in fits and starts, a couple of days of extensive heavy rains followed by a lull of many days. It wasn't as if that the monsoons didn't have variability earlier; it is just that now the variability is much more extreme and evident.

Take the monsoon patterns this year, in June, the rains pretty much avoided the city. Mumbai recorded just 395 mm of rain in June, while the average is around 550 mm. This was the lowest monthly rainfall in five years. After missing the targets in June, the rain gods went on an overdrive in the first week of July. The city recorded 506 mm rain in just six days from July 1 to July 6, against a monthly average of 840.7 mm. Simply put, 60 percent of the month's average rainfall was recorded in just six days. After this downpour, the rains dissipated and there was marginal rainfall for the rest of the month. Nonetheless, just because of the substantial spurt in the first six days, the city surpassed its July 2014 record (1,468.5 mm) for the all-time high monthly rainfall with 1,474.3mm, making it the wettest July in 76 years.

Yet, despite having a record-wet July, the water-levels in the six lakes were at record lows, prompting the BMC to announce a 20 percent water-cut across the board. The announcement got the denizens worried and possibly there were renewed appeals to the gods above to relent, which they did.

So, starting August, the skies opened up. In the first five days of August, Mumbai has received 78 percent of the month's average rain. The Santacruz weather observatory recorded 459.3 mm rain from August 1 to 5. Out of which 99 percent was recorded in just two days, namely August 4 and 5, when the city received extremely heavy to heavy rain. The monthly average rainfall for August is 585.2 mm. Not surprisingly, the whole city was inundated and drenched. There were landslides in different parts of the city, hundreds of trees were uprooted, and certain places were flooded. As usual, the reports in the media started the blame spiel of how unprepared BMC was, how the administration has been ineffective in managing the annual event. The chorus got loud enough for the scion of the Thackeray family and Minister for Tourism and Environment in the Maharashtra government, Aditya Thackeray to respond. ""Mumbai received almost 330 mm rain in 8 hours yesterday and equal day before. Gusty winds up to 107 kmph. We've been battered by strong winds and heavy rains, never seen such a thing as before. We will stand up again, stronger and better, yet in sync with climate change needs.""

The young minister gave a clue to where the burden of the monsoon misery lay, namely, climate change. Generally, politicians are not averse to shedding responsibility or shifting the blame, but this time agreeing with Thackeray scion is not all too hard. Scientific data that has been collated over the years is pointing to that pattern. For years, studies after studies have warned that torrential rains in spurts will be the new-normal.

According to experts, extreme precipitation events are on the rise in large parts of India, especially multi-day deluges that lead to large-scale floods. One study showed a three-fold rise in extreme precipitation events across central India from 1950 to 2015. The reason is pretty clear, a cocktail of global warming, unplanned urban growth, and environmental degradation is increasing flood risk in India, especially the cities.

Mumbai city is a vivid example of how environmental degradation and unplanned urbanisation are creating havoc. At one end, we have the wanton destruction of the mangroves that acted as a natural shield and absorbed excess water, on the other the river plains within the city that ensured water flowed to the Arabian Sea have been blocked by construction of housing and commercial complexes. Green pockets in the city are continually being sacrificed on the altar of development, be it thousands of trees in the Aarey area or rampant destruction of estuarine area for the coastal road. No wonder, we are now paying the price.

And the price will only escalate in the days to come. According to a study published in the Nature Communication magazine, the worse is yet to come. ""We find that there is a threefold increase in widespread extreme precipitation events over central India during 1950-2015,"" according to the researchers. The team also succeeded in tracking down the main culprit: moisture from the Arabian Sea in the north of the Indian Ocean. As the sea continues to warm courtesy climate change, the frequency and severity of killer storms in India are likely to increase manifold.

A climate study published way back in 2009, had predicted this scenario, namely how increased precipitation including monsoonal rains is likely to come in the form of fewer rainy days but more days of extreme rainfall events, with increasing amounts of rain in each event, leading to significant flooding. Drizzle-type precipitation that replenishes soil moisture is likely to decrease.

According to the ""India: The Impact of Climate Change to 2030: A Commissioned Research Report,"" most global models suggest that the Indian summer monsoons will intensify. ""The timing may also shift, causing a drying during the late summer growing season. Climate models also predict earlier snowmelt, which could have a significant adverse effect on agricultural production. Growing emissions of aerosols from energy production and other sources may suppress rainfall, leading to drier conditions with more dust and smoke from the burning of drier vegetation, affecting both regional and global hydrological cycles and agricultural production,"" it went on to add.

With the world unable to control the temperate increase below 2°C, such climatic upheavals will be a common factor, especially in the coastal region. The sudden floods in Chennai, Bengaluru and the recurring ones in Mumbai point towards a pattern, and an indication of where things are headed. The only thing we can do now is to understand, evaluate and be better prepared for such eventualities. The BMC, which earlier was content to clean up the city-drains in preparation for the monsoon will have to do a lot more. Climate change mitigation is a distant dream now; climate change adaptation is the new mantra.

Now, the Mumbaikar will also need to come to terms with the new reality. Earlier, we used to track El Nino and La Nina; now we will need to track the water temperatures of the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean which have a direct bearing on the city monsoon. Guess, another tracker will be added to our already long list. A price for being an urban Indian.

The bureaucracy blamed the high-intensity rainfall and outdated infrastructure; the people blamed it on a lack of “political will” and an absence of planning.

After the devastating 2005 floods in Mumbai, the Madhav Chitale Committee report pointed out that even if the entire system had been upgraded as per its new stormwater drainage project or BRIMSTOWAD, it would not have been adequate for the rainfall of such high intensity. BRIMSTOWAD was designed to deal with “normal occasions of rainfall”, not high intensity rainfall events.

The Chitale report came out 14 years ago. Since then, extreme rainfall events have become more frequent. Meanwhile, natural water courses are being filled up and diverted (disrupting drainage patterns), permeable areas are being paved and built upon (increasing run-off), coastal areas are being reclaimed to create new land (displacing water elsewhere).

Mumbai is drowning because its land is being made more impermeable, ecological systems are being built upon, and extreme weather events are becoming “normal.” Yet, instead of examining the relations between coastal communities and delicate ecosystems, Mumbai’s planners are looking for ways to make more land.

The proposal to build a land-filled 9.8-kilometre Coastal Road along the western shoreline has attracted strong criticism: from public transport advocates, who decry the neglect of overburdened public transport infrastructure; environmentalists, who scorn the authorities’ ignorance of a fragile coastal ecology; residents, who worry about the traffic mayhem it will create in their neighborhoods; and from the artisanal fisherfolk, who point out that the project will decimate their traditional shallow water fishing grounds and coastal commons.

The city government and highway builders have circumvented coastal protection regulations, evaded democratic process, skirted public debate, and outmaneuvered legal opposition to continue “reclaiming” the coast exclusively for motorists and developers. Already, a significant amount of work – mainly land-filling – has been completed, without requisite environmental and wildlife clearance.

On August 18, the Chief Justice of India conceded that the project is not exempt from clearances.

Although slowed by the flight of construction workers due to Mumbai’s poor handling of the coronavirus pandemic, work on the project continued even during the total lockdown in the months of April and May – the municipal corporation claimed that the reclamation was “essential pre-monsoon work”. Curiously, the city’s stormwater system did not get such attention.

And so, even as Mumbai sees the number of Covid-19 cases rise, with tens of thousands needing food and healthcare, frontline workers lacking safety equipment, and health infrastructure unable to cope, the government continues to invest in a project that will serve no more than 0.54% of its daily commuter trips.

Inertia of infrastructure

In the early 1990s, city planners were gripped by dreams of a “world class Mumbai” modeled on the fossil-fuel addicted American metropolis. Based on these outmoded recommendations and an increase in access to infrastructure financing, highway building became an obsession. In two decades, Mumbai built 50 flyovers, multiple arterial links, a freeway on the eastern coast and a 5.6 kilometre sea-link – all meant predominantly for cars. The latest link of this high-speed expressway network is the Coastal Road, which, estimated at a cost of Rs. 14,000 crores, is set to become the most expensive freeway ever built in the country.

People don’t use cars – as transport planners like to believe – simply because they can afford them; people use cars because we continue to invest in them. Public transport advocates often point out that car-oriented infrastructure projects take away both investment and road space from mass-transit modes like buses and railways, and non-motorised modes like walking and cycling. This is undoubtedly true. We must add: like other mass-transit modes, cars require fossil fuels to run; but while public transportation gets people around, cars are more efficient at converting fossil fuels into CO2.

The behavioral shift towards private automobiles is encouraged by a vast infrastructure that makes car use possible and profitable – road networks, fuel-stations, oil terminals, construction plants, automobile factories – which embody the interests of economic and political groups who own and control them. Each time the city builds a freeway, this infrastructure is strengthened, making it more entrenched, making carbon mitigation more difficult, and making alternatives less likely to succeed. This inertia of certain kinds of infrastructure is called “carbon lock-in” – the tendency of fossil-fuel based technologies to persist and perpetuate behavior that accelerate emissions, “lock-out” alternatives, and tether future generations to a path they did not choose.

One of the fundamental tenets of climate science is that emissions are cumulative, which means that every tonne of CO2 emitted is more lethal than the one released before. And therefore, as the city pours money and concrete to build a freeway inducing more car traffic, it endangers the future of generations to come. Iin the words of the climate historian Andreas Malm, the emissions produced by cars are “so many invisible missiles aimed at the future”.

Sea-level rise and flooding

Over more than a century, the average temperature in Mumbai has risen, and extremely heavy rainfall days have increased. The warming Arabian Sea is generating high-intensity storms in the region. But with wetlands and forested areas indiscriminately sacrificed for real-estate development, the coastal city’s ability to absorb and drain storm water has been severely damaged. On the other hand, basic infrastructure suffers from appalling deficiencies. As a result, almost every year as the monsoon hits Mumbai, the city floods – and hundreds of people living in low-lying areas of the city lose their lives.

The human and socio-economic impacts of Mumbai’s neoliberal development policy become obvious each year as new disasters strike the city. The denial of the risks posed by climate change and denial of the causal links between “development” and devastation is staggering.

For instance, the technical studies for the Coastal Road project systematically underestimate sea-level rise due to global warming - a nothing-to-worry-about assumption of 1.27 mm per year. This, despite the recorded correlation between global temperature and sea-level rise of about 3.4 mm per year. Meanwhile, the conservative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates sea-level rise by 1.1 meters by 2100, while other institutions estimate anything between 0.5 to over 2 meters by 2100.

According to the US military, scenarios of 1.5 meter rise by 2100 cannot be ruled out for planning adaptation measures. Mumbai’s average coastal line is fairly low, and in many areas it is just 1 meter above the mean sea level.

Undermining the role of ecosystem services

From an ecological perspective, the coast is a highly productive zone comprising diverse interconnected ecosystems: rocky shores and sandy beaches intercepted at various points along the coastline by creeks or estuaries where freshwater streams meet the sea. The geomorphic formations of the nearshore (intertidal) and foreshore (subtidal) areas of the rocky coastline determine the nature of coastal habitats that harbor and support various communities of organisms.

The submerged rocky seabed is a rich breeding ground for a variety of fish that converge in this area at the end of summer during the monsoons to lay eggs; and the tidal pools in the intertidal area which is currently being reclaimed, is a nursery for juvenile fish.

Mumbai’s average coastal line is fairly low, and in many areas it is just 1 meter above the mean sea level. Credit: Aaran Patel

Yet the Environmental Impact Assessment report for the Coastal Road project seriously underplayed the rich ecology of the rocky shore. When obtaining clearance for the project from the expert appraisal committee, the Mumbai municipal corporation denied the existence along the shoreline of protected, important or sensitive species of flora or fauna for breeding and nesting. It is not surprising, that the Bombay High Court declared that the studies carried out for the project were inadequate, and that the clearance was granted with nothing more than “lip service to the requirement of the law.”

When citizens’ groups pointed out the presence of corals in the intertidal area – a Schedule 1 species protected under the wildlife protection Act – the municipal corporation commissioned studies after reclamation had already begun, now paying lip service to the requirement of ecological protection.

The post-facto studies propose “mitigation measures”: quasi-ecological interventions that eschew a systemic grasp of ecological processes that sustain biodiversity as well as of intertidal ecologies which absorb and hold excess tidal water, act as a buffer against tidal currents and help in flood mitigation. In fact, unaltered coastal ecosystems can often provide better and less expensive flood and storm protection.

According to geomorphologists, reclamations for the project will significantly affect tidal activity and cause an increase in wave and tidal attack on structures along the shore, resulting in damage to human establishments, and endangering lives.

Social ecology, customary rights and ocean grabbing

It is revealing that the Mumbai municipal corporation hired consultants to prepare both the project and implementation plans as well as the social and environmental impact assessment studies of their own plans – a practice that is inevitably prone to a whole range of evaluation biases.

For instance, in the Social Impact Assessment for the project, there was neither an acknowledgement of the existence of the traditional fishing zones, or of the customary use of the nearshore and foreshore areas for artisanal fishing activity.

For artisanal fisherfolk, the coast is a productive landscape – the intricate fabric of economic, social and cultural life, rooted in the interface between land and water. The health of the ecology of these shallow coastal waters are thus critical to the livelihoods of the artisanal fishers, who have adopted methods of fishing suited to various ecological and geomorphic conditions of the coast; their customary practices ensure the preservation of coastal biodiversity.

The fisherfolk follow distinctive social arrangements of apportioning these marine and intertidal commons - areas that are now being snatched away from them for coastal real-estate. Land-filling for the Coastal Road will decimate the coastal ecology of the intertidal and shallow waters and the livelihoods of the artisanal fisherfolk.

Reclamation for the Coastal Road, is thus “ocean grabbing” – defined as “capturing of control by powerful economic actors of crucial decision-making around fisheries”. It involves the violation of economic, social and cultural rights of coastal communities, especially small fishers, that depend on the sea for livelihood. The project will lead to the dispossession of the artisanal fishers, and appropriation of the use, control and access to the fishing waters and marine resources from its existing users and right-holders.

Environmental deregulation and marketable nature

When confronted with the various criticisms of the project, the city government quickly recast the Coastal Road project as “coastal protection infrastructure”. Coastal ecology will be supplanted with Miyawaki forests. Biodiversity will supposedly thrive in eco-concrete. Nature is now available as marketable technologies – and every system “viable”. Climate change mitigation, after all, can also be made profitable

Since the 2005 floods in Mumbai, environmental experts have predicted many such events unless planners realise the role of natural areas and permeable land in providing ecosystem services. Yet, planners continue to act with the assumption that Mumbai’s most urgent priorities are freeways, not storm water drains; cars, not clean air; real-estate development, not environmental protection. This is a mindset shaped by land economics and hydraulics, not life systems and hydrology.

In its original form, the Coastal Regulation Zone of 2011 only permitted roads on stilts to ensure free flow of tidal waters and minimise ecological impacts. Months before the Coastal Road project was cleared, however, the CRZ was amended to permit reclamation of the seabed for constructing roads –

frustrating the very intent of the law it was introduced under. As we see the social and economic costs of planning failures multiply each year, the only legal protections to ecological systems are being relaxed and dismantled. The storm is picking up speed, the rainfall is gathering intensity, the oceans are rising, but the authorities continue to talk and act as though the worst is behind us.

If business-as-usual continues, Mumbai will soon be untenable. Sea walls will not hold back storm surges, Miyawaki forests on reclaimed land will not absorb surface water, eco-concrete will not revive lost livelihoods.

Our cities urgently need progressive environmental action rather than schemes that help some people profit from crises. Ecological planning, environmental restoration, investment in basic infrastructure, retrofitting for climate mitigation: these are some steps that may help us cope and endure. But the “window of opportunity” is shrinking.

Hyderabad’s recent floods are but one example.

The southern Indian city of Hyderabad is reeling under its worst floods in over a century. Since the second week of October it has been lashed by heavy and incessant rain, which has put vast swathes of the city under water.

Rainfall has been unprecedented. On October 13, Hyderabad is estimated to have received around 192 millimeters of rain, with some areas in the city like Himayat Nagar and Charminar receiving 298.8 mm and 245 mm respectively that day. The amount of rain the city received over a 24-hour period on October 13 exceeded what it typically receives over a month in October.

Extreme weather events like the Hyderabad rains are evident across India and growing in frequency. On July 2, Mumbai witnessed the second heaviest rainfall in a single day over the past 44 years, the highest being July 26, 2005 when the city received 944 mm in 24 hours. In 2015, Chennai received 490 mm of rain in 24 hours, the highest in a century.

Even such copious rainfall wouldn’t have led to the kind of flooding that India’s cities are witnessing had their drainage systems been functioning. Sadly, natural and man-made drainage systems that would have helped drain off excess water have been undermined over the decades and particularly so in recent years. Unplanned urban development, encroachment of lakes, and construction of buildings on reclaimed water bodies are preventing the natural run-off of water.

A 400-year-old city, Hyderabad sits on the banks of the Musi River. Hundreds of small man-made lakes, all linking up with the Musi and its tributaries, were constructed over the centuries and following the floods of 1908, two large artificial lakes, Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar, were added to the intricate network constructed to regulate the flow of water into the Musi.

Over the past century, Hyderabad has grown enormously. Unchecked encroachment of lakes and building construction on reclaimed land and river embankments have eaten into waterways, causing them to overflow during downpours. Low-lying areas and reclaimed land go under water quickly.

Hyderabad is located in an arid region. As activist Lubna Sarawath has observed “rains should have been a blessing, but now they’re a nightmare.”

Whether it is Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, or Mumbai, waterways and canals that would have drained off water have vanished and in their place shopping malls, apartment complexes, and even airports have come up. Chennai international airport’s runways are built over the usually dry Adyar River. When water in the Chembarambakkam reservoir was released during the downpour in December 2015, it rushed through its natural waterway to the sea – the Adyar. But with the river blocked, the water flooded Chennai’s tarmac and soon the airport was engulfed in water.

In the name of infrastructure development, Mumbai’s mangrove forests, which are its natural defenses against floods, are being cleared to make way for high-rise buildings and freight corridors. But mangroves absorb excess water and the building constructions are blocking rainwater from flowing freely to the sea. This is among the main reasons for the annual flooding that Mumbai experiences.

Aggravating the problem of flooding are old urban drainage systems. Mumbai’s is over a century old. According to a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Mumbai’s drains “are heavily silted and punctured at many places.” They have the capacity to take on 25 mm of rainfall per hour but during the monsoon, rainfall often exceeds 50 mm per hour.

Civic authorities do not prioritize improving the capacity of these drains. Meanwhile poor waste management and sewage systems are adding to the pressure. Dumping of construction debris in drains is rampant, causing the clogging of stormwater drains and sewage pipes. It results in sewage pipes throwing up fecal and other waste onto roads and into homes.

Consequently, urban flooding is usually followed by a spurt in cases of cholera and gastroenteritis. India is already struggling under the pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic. Flood-related epidemics loom too.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

""I was 10 years old then and remember this because my mother was heart-broken as the plants she had lovingly nurtured were destroyed,"" Nadkarny told PTI.

""On November 22 that year Mumbai, then Bombay, was completely paralysed after the fierce storm which raged for 20 hours. Intermittent rains caused floods in several parts of the city,"" another senior citizen said.

A newspaper's headline on November 23 1948 read ""Bombay paralysed by cyclone"". The cyclone had struck Mumbai on November 21 shortly after sunset, the newspaper said.

The city was without power supply. The Bombay station of All India Radio was affected, telegraphic communication breached,electric supply cut off and local transport system was disrupted,"" the newspaper reported.

Seven people were killed and over 100 injured in a single day, it said. The casualties were due to house collapses and were roads blocked by uprooted trees, it added.

Fishing boats, motor launches in the harbour were either sunk or damaged, it said.

In 2013, Mumbai was listed by the journal Nature Climate Change as the fifth coastal city in the world to be most affected by flooding in the future, measured by economic losses. The first four are Guangzhou, Miami, New York-Newark and New Orleans.

According to rainfall data released by the India Meteorological Department, the suburb of Malad West had received 301 mm of rain from 8.30 am until 7.30 pm on Monday. Late at night, residents of Malad, Andheri, Borivili, Ghatkopar, Kurla, Chembur and other suburbs said the rain was coming down in thick sheets in their neighbourhoods.

“Suburban rainfall values are very high. Take care,” tweeted IMD Deputy Director General K S Hoslaikar in the evening. In another tweet, he said: “Mumbai almost non stop heavy rains since Friday …Vigorous activity. Now laso intense spells are continu(ing) and cumulative rainfall figure tomorrow morning would be very interesting figure”.

As the downpour continued without let-up at night, concerns rose for shanties and settlements on riverbanks and along nullahs. Social media buzzed with photographs of water logging at various places, including train tracks.

In Malad, where the highest rainfall was recorded, residents said it had been raining non-stop in their area. “It has been raining heavily since last night. I managed to get to work in Andheri in the morning but it took me over two hours just to travel from Malad (east) to Malad (west) to each home, which normally takes 20 minutes,” said Khadija Shaikh.

Other residents of Malad also said that the Western Express highway south-bound traffic was at a standstill in the evening. “It had been raining non-stop since morning with barely a few breaks of no showers. In some areas water had accumulated knee-deep,” said Amit Das, a Malad resident.

195,195,mumbai,2019,https://scroll.in/article/929936/another-monsoon-another-deluge-why-mumbai-gets-inundated-nearly-every-year,10 Jul 2019,"Another monsoon, another deluge: Why Mumbai gets inundated nearly every year","When the rain poured down on Mumbai last week, drowning the city in what now seems like an annual affair, it once again brought up the question – why is Mumbai never prepared for a deluge? The answers, unfortunately, remain the same – an outdated drainage system, destruction of the natural barriers against climate change and unsustainable urbanisation are weighing heavy on the city’s capacity to deal with heavy monsoons and climate change.

India’s commercial capital in the Western state of Maharashtra, the metropolis of some 22 million, is inundated for at least one day every year with heavy rains. Suburban railways, road transport, air traffic and normal public life is disrupted for a few days each time. This time, starting on July 1, which was the sixth day of the monsoons, incessant rains for 48 hours coupled with a stressed drainage system created havoc, resulting in the death of over 30 people due to a wall collapse and other rain-related incidents. Thousands of commuters were stuck in local trains till late at night. A commercial aircraft skidded off the primary runway and disrupted over 200 flights for the entire week.

On July 2, Mumbai witnessed the second heaviest rainfall in a day, in the last 45 years and the highest in a decade. The highest rainfall recorded in a single day remains July 26, 2005.

Ironically, barely a week before Mumbai was flooded with rains, Maharashtra struggled with a drought on 50% of its geographical area affecting the life and livelihood of millions. Hardships went up as the monsoon skipped its official arrival date of June 10, by a fortnight. Mumbai too was facing a 10% water cut since November 2018. The water stock in seven lakes supplying water to Mumbai dipped to 6% in June this year.

This stark contrast, between extremes, flood and water scarcity in the same state and parts of the same city, continues to expose the poor management of water resources.

“The city’s inability to bear heavy downpours exposes the failure of the civic body to improve its drainage system and political system that has allowed unbridled development which affected the region’s natural capacity to absorb heavy rainfall,” Debi Goenka, an environment activist, told Mongabay.

The administrators meanwhile pointed to the changing climate and its impact on the monsoon. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis told the Legislative Assembly that Mumbai suburbs witnessed extremely heavy rains up to 375 mm to 400 mm in three-four hours which was unprecedented. The Municipal Commissioner of Mumbai Pravin Pardeshi, while speaking to the media, attributed climate change as a cause for the floods saying that Mumbai received rainfall equal to a month’s in just two days. He said that Mumbai has been pumping out a massive amount of rainwater – something no other city in the world can match.

Outdated drainage system

Mumbai’s inability to drain out rainwater effectively is in part due to its old drainage system that cannot cope with the capacity of rainfall that the city witnesses on days like these. The city’s stormwater drainage system, almost a century old, is a network of surface drains across 2,000 km and underground drains of about 400 km. “But they [drains] are heavily silted and punctured at many places,” points out the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, in its report tabled in the state Assembly on July 2. “Their outfall to the sea is affected by high tides as 42 of 45 outfall lack flood gates.”

The report also states that the city’s drains have the capacity for 25 mm per hour rainfall in low tide while rainfall on a few days of the monsoon crosses over 50 mm an hour.

The Mumbai floods of 2005, where more than 1,095 lives were lost amid 945 mm rainfall and high tides were a wake-up call that the city needed to upgrade its drainage system.

The Brihanmumbai Storm Water Disposal System, commonly called the BRIMSTOWAD project, to overhaul Mumbai’s drainage system was proposed in 1993 after the 1985 floods and was intended to be a longterm road map for the city’s vulnerability to flooding. However, no action was taken due to the financial cost of the project until the 2005 floods when the Chitale committee formed to analyse the deluge also recommended to upgrade Mumbai’s old stormwater drainage system.

As of 2019, work is reportedly in progress to increase the capacity of the stormwater drains to handle rainfall intensity of 50 mm per hour. But varied complications, outdated methodologies, rampant encroachments and associated rising costs prove to be regular barriers to the progress of this project.

“Lack of political will, poor governance and unplanned development at the cost of Mumbai’s natural flood cover are responsible for this,” Milind Deora, the opposition leader and the former chief of Mumbai’s Indian National Congress party told Mongabay. “The Shivsena-Bhartiya Janta Party ruled civic body has miserably failed to upgrade and clean the stormwater drainage system.”

On July 1 itself, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai had registered a criminal case against a private firm for dumping debris near a drain thus blocking the passage of rainwater. The same day the Bombay High Court reserved its judgement on a petition against the construction of a Coastal Road. The project along the Arabian Sea will link the two ends of Mumbai allegedly without environment clearance and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was accused of giving clearance to a hotel project in no-development zone.

Mumbai’s landscape

A journey across Mumbai today is a series of works in progress. Some necessary, some debatable, but all pretty much focused on the needs of the city’s over 22 million human residents. Excavators and cranes loom over the city roads, drilling-sounds mix with the honking of cars and patches of natural green are replaced with built-up spaces to meet the city’s vast and varied housing requirements.

The Mumbai Metro, the coastal road, a new airport, the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project and a series of other road links are being developed to ensure that the city keeps moving. But as Mumbai rushes to keep up with its reputation of a city that never stops, these markers of urban growth are swallowing up the forests, coastline and ecology as they spread through the metropolis.

The peninsular city bursting with concrete structures was once a mixed wetland ecosystem of mangrove forests. But over the past century, mangroves have been levelled and waterways filled with construction debris, leaving the city vulnerable to flooding without its natural protectors.

The Flood Preparedness Guidelines 2019 report by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai notes that the process of urbanisation has played a major role aggravating the problem as it has caused significant alterations to hydrology, morphology, habitat and ecology of the city. Inadequate drainage, overflow of the Mithi river and a combination of high tides and high river flow all contribute to the regular floods in Mumbai, it states.

Reclamation has been increasingly seen as a solution to limited land in Mumbai. The city’s area has increased from 437 sq km in 1991 to 482 sq km now due to reclamations and years of silting by the sea. The coastal tract of Mumbai is hence low lying, with the average height at some points just a metre above mean sea level. The major projects developed on reclaimed land includes Bandra Worli Sea Link, the Bandra Kurla Complex and the Lokhandwala complex.

Environmentalist Stalin D of Vanashakti says, “Any kind of reclamation is bound to alter the tidal pattern and intensity.”

Mumbai used to be two groups of islands, with the southern island city said to have consisted of seven smaller islands that have were developed into one unit through reclamation projects. The first land reclamation in Mumbai was undertaken in the first decade of the 18th century and more continued thereafter. While the success of reclamation is debatable and alternative experiences of the project lesser documented, the overarching idea of land reclamation is propagated to be a symbol of urban growth that has continued well into modern times.

Mumbai’s mangroves

Mangrove forests, found at the intersection of land and sea, are natural defenders against the impacts of climate change. As storms become more erratic and severe due to climate change, the importance of mangroves with their complex root system holding on to the land becomes pronounced.

As per an estimate by Vanashakti, the metro city has lost 40% of its mangrove forest cover between the early 1990s and 2005 putting communities at risk. Using satellite images, the NGO has estimated that Mumbai’s mangrove cover is shrunk by 15% to 20% in the last five years due to the dumping of debris and encroachment. Meanwhile, the State of Forest report 2017 by Forest Survey of India notes that city and suburban Mumbai has 66 sq km of mangroves and Thane has 90 sq km, noting an increase from the 2015 assessment.

The available data of the city’s mangrove cover, while conflicting in parts, does not rule out the role of mangroves in protecting the city against storm surges and coastal erosion as well as the threats these ecosystems face from changing land-use patterns and human activity.

Debi Goenka warns, “We should brace up for more challenging times ahead as additional 355 hectares of mangroves are being wiped out for diversion for Navi Mumbai airport, bullet train project, Mumbai Trans Harbour Link and Malad Sewage Treatment Plant.”

Stalin said, “Since Forest Survey of India’s assessment has revealed that Mumbai’s mangrove cover has increased, the politicians are out to exploit it further.”

While the loss of big parcels of mangrove cover gets media attention, the small-time encroachments such as dumping of debris and encroachments on land which eventually is overtaken by real estate developers remain under wraps, which is a cause of concern, say, activists.

Dharmesh Barai, environment activist, says, “The administration and local politicians ignore our repeated alerts about encroachments in new areas.”

Nature’s systems fail

In addition to drainage upgrades and other infrastructural interventions to keep Mumbai from flooding, experts have time and again emphasised the importance of maintaining natural systems that keep floodwater in check. Mumbai is lucky to have an ecological landscape that can naturally protect the city, provided it is maintained.

The rivers in Mumbai, which are natural stormwater drainage systems, are in a poor state where they can no longer serve that function. One of the major rivers, Mithi, has become a veritable sewer, choked with domestic and industrial waste and overflows every monsoon.

The other major rivers – Dahisar, Poisar and Oshiwara rivers – are also prone to overflowing because of similar reasons. The wetlands along the river, too, have disappeared, say activists.

Additionally, Mumbai is blessed with 2,100 hectares of salt pans which act as buffers for tide and heavy rainfall but were deemed not to be wetlands following a revision of the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules in 2017. Over 15% of the salt pan cover has been opened up for construction of affordable housing.

Environmentalist Stalin D of NGO Vanashakti says, “Saltpans are the lowest-lying areas of the city. If you start converting them into concrete, first the chances of floods will go up and then entire saltpans will be grabbed by land sharks who get the rules bent in their favour.”

Tree covers are also ecological pathways to reduce the impact of flooding as roots create channels in the soil for the water to seep through. Mumbai’s Sanjay Gandhi National Park, an 82 sq km area, is a massive green cover and functioning lungs of the city, which is being suffocated due to encroachment and other construction activities. The adjoining Aarey Milk Colony and part of its tree cover is also under threat from a proposed metro line car shed.

As the natural protectors against climate change are razed down to make way for a growing population’s habitat, it’s the people themselves that will be exposed directly to the risk of flooding.

The situation of Mumbai is aptly summed up in by Amitav Ghosh in his book The Great Derangement, “Mumbai is a finger sticking out into the open sea. If a superstorm were to hit Mumbai, Mumbai would have no defences. The storm surge would go straight into the city. You’re literally thinking of a 30-foot or 40-foot wave just going into the city...”

Communities at risk

A ranking of world cities most exposed to coastal floods listed Mumbai at the very top, in terms of the population exposed to coastal floods. The study estimated that by 2070, Mumbai will move to second place, overtaken by Kolkata, but with about five times more people exposed to coastal floods as compared to 2005. “Most of them would be from tribal, fishing and marginalised communities,” says Barai.

Coastal cities around the world are prone to extreme weather events. Over 21 of the world’s 31 megacities lie along a coastline and many share the threat of severe storms, heavier rainfalls and rise in sea levels. By reducing emissions in line with the Paris climate agreement, coastal cities will certainly be saved from the worst, but even small amounts of global warming and sea-level rise will directly influence them.

Cities are already on the pathway to adapt to the changing climate. New York City protects its shoreline by codes that provide updated flood risks. In Jakarta, seawalls are a short term measure while a longer-term plan to relocate people in calamity is in pipeline, according to a report.

Thackeray, whose party has ruled the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) since 1997, could not step out of his residence, 'Matoshree', in Bandra as the area remained flooded for almost 10 hours. His son Aditya managed to get out with the help of friends to inspect the affected areas. Hours later, Aditya concluded that it was the 374 mm of rainfall, the second heaviest downpour in a day in 45 years, and not the BMC that was responsible for the mess. ""No city corporation in any part of the world could have sustained in such heavy rains,"" Aditya reasoned.

Mumbai, a reclaimed cluster of seven islands -- Colaba, Little Colaba, Isle of Bombay, Mazgaon, Parel, Worli and Mahim -- receives an average 2,386 mm of rainfall every year, waterlogging the low-lying parts of central Mumbai during heavy downpours. Till 2000, the city's drainage coped well with the rains, flushing out the water into the sea within hours. Unplanned development and the BMC's inefficiency in maintaining and upgrading the city's drainage in the past two decades have severely aggravated the waterlogging problem.

The BMC is the richest civic body in Asia. Its annual budget for 2018-19 was Rs 27,258 crore. This fiscal, it has presented a budget of Rs 30,692 crore. The municipality spends 18 per cent of its budget on civic infrastructure, but that does not reflect in the city's preparedness for rains. Authorities say Mumbai's storm-water drains have the capacity to carry only 50 mm of rain-water an hour. After the deluge of July 26, 2005, when 944 mm of rainfall in a day kept Mumbai submerged for two days, the civic body had undertaken a project to upgrade the drainage system. Fourteen years on, the Brihanmumbai Storm Water Disposal System (BRIMSTOWAD) project has completed the revamp of only 20 storm-water drains, out of the city's 51. More than Rs 20,000 crore has already been spent on the project.

Experts say sewerage passing through storm-water drains, too, is affecting their water-carrying capacity. BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi, an IAS officer, has assured that the corporation will take measures to prevent sewage water from entering storm-water drains. Town planner Amita Bhide says the city's development agencies need macro-planning and better coordination to show results.

Therein lies the problem. At present, nine agencies, including the BMC, Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), Maharashtra government, railways and Airports Authority of India, have a say in the city's development. Poor coordination among them affects planning. Every year, the BMC and MMRDA blame each other for the poor condition of roads in the city. The BMC blames the railways for not cleaning the sewage drains falling in its domain. The railways have an excellent public announcements system, using which messages can be delivered across suburban railway stations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The system can also be used for alerting people in case floods or other calamities, but remains untapped.

Citizen's group 'Mumbai First' is of the opinion that the city needs a CEO position at the helm, who can work independently without pressure from the politicians.



Thackeray has been arguing for years that the BMC be empowered as the sole planning and development authority for Mumbai. The present mayor is a decorative post, with all execution powers concentrated in the hands of the BMC commissioner, who is a representative of the state government. Thackeray is also not averse to the idea of electing the mayor directly from among the people and enjoying executive powers to order other agencies on planning and development issues. The hurdle is no agency wants to lose control over Maximum City and the revenue it generates for it.

It’s time to realise that it’s not only the unprecedented rainstorm which causes the flood but a specific model of urbanisation which places an unnatural premium on land and what urbanists call the 3Ps – pave, pipe and pump. It’s time to look beyond the capacity of the stormwater drains and water pumping stations. The stormwater drains in British Bombay, the legend goes, were designed to carry roughly four times London’s rainfall of 6mm per hour because rainfall data for the city was not available. This capacity was steadily increased to the present 50mm per hour.

The volume of rain far exceeds capacity. When Mumbai was rained out on July 1-2 it received 375mm over 24 hours; July 26-27 saw 219mm, and August 3-4 had more than 204mm.

The 24-hour measurement does not shed light on the pattern of rainfall. Rather than a sustained spell over the 24 hours in which it’s measured, the altered rainfall patterns – due to climate change – are short and extremely intense episodes which end up flooding the city.

So what can be done? Urbanists and planners I spoke to say that Mumbai’s administrators must recognise that the flood is not rain but rainwater that does not – or cannot – flow out, and suggest a slew of measures besides the usual technological ones.

First, respect the lay of the land – Mumbai is a coastal city with rivers and creeks and wetlands all of which are meant to carry water out. The rivers must be cleaned of garbage and encroachments, and wetlands protected at all costs.

Second, the city’s plans must be redrawn to make space for rainwater both on the ground and below the ground. Urban planning must include geology and hydrogeology of areas so that development and construction are aligned to the natural topography. Third, a new perspective and innovative methods have to be cultivated to rainwater even when it’s a torrential downpour – this means even heavy rain is seen as a water resource rather than a disaster.

There are examples from other cities which Mumbai can adopt. Chicago has created nearly 100 “Green Alleys” in the last 12 years; these are best described as permeable pavements which allow rainwater to filter through and drain into the ground. New York had built about 3,000 bioswales till last year; bioswales are ditches with vegetation, engineered soil, and porous bottom which absorb rainwater to slow down its path to or reduce the quantity in stormwater drains.

Rain gardens are relatively small areas in individual plots and housing societies which act as a sponge to collect the run-off from hard surfaces like terraces and so on, with sturdy vegetation and avenues to beautify it. Milan’s rain gardens have helped it to slow down the run-off and recharge groundwater. Cities like Berlin and Edinburgh have created urban farms in well-selected locations to handle the stormwater.

Cities have adopted greening-and-blueing strategy – greening is to bring nature back into built cities and use it to balance heat and heavy rainfall, blueing is to create areas which can be flooded and increase open water surfaces so that water can stand.

Rotterdam, the Dutch delta city, embarked on a plan five years ago to make water plazas, green walls-roofs-facades which absorb water, floating neighbourhoods, and massive water storage facilities including an underground water parking garage the size of four Olympic swimming pools.

Flood-proofing or flood-preparedness is a process, it’s time that the BMC and government set Mumbai on the path in a well-strategised and time-bound manner. There’s no point trotting out the same excuses every year.

Sixteen people have died already after five days of heavy downpour in Mumbai. But it is not about the death toll alone: Many more precious lives are put at risk, livelihoods are compromised as daily routines are put on hold even as a familiar script plays out in India's financial capital monsoon after monsoon.

And it is not Mumbai alone. Indian cities, croaking under ever-increasing burdens of population, have been falling prey to floods so often (think Chennai, ironically starved for drinking water) that it has become the new normal.

So is that it? Are governments and people helplessly supposed to take urban flooding as normative? Or is there something to be done?

There is actually. Only if careful attention is paid. Down To Earth has been covering the issue for some time now. Here are some ready reckoners:

A study conducted by the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and leading accounting company KPMG has revealed that Mumbai incurred a loss of Rs 14,000 crore due to floods. The hefty amount was lost for various reasons in the period between 2005 and 2015.

The US agencies hired to study the floods, that wreak havoc in the city year after year, also revealed that 3,000 people died due to rain-related incidents during this period. This figure includes the over thousand people who lost their lives in the July 26, 2005 deluge that had brought the Maximum City to a standstill. On that fateful day, Mumbai had received 944 mm of rainfall in 24 hours, the highest recorded in the past 100 years, Mumbai Mirror reported.

Notably, the ‘Flood Management and Vulnerability Assessment To Climate Risk for Mumbai Metropolitan Region’ report was submitted to the state government in August.

In March 2019, Maharashtra’s Relief and Rehabilitation Department commissioned the study, which found out that “major infrastructure development rarely takes into account the level of hazard”. It further adds that the areas that are vulnerable and prone to disasters, are seldom identified.

This is the first time the losses incurred by the city due to heavy rainfall every monsoon, has been tapped and quantified. While the two US agencies put a figure to the devastation the city grappled with for a decade till 2015, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and its fringe areas have been inundated several times thereafter. Needless to say, had those damages been accounted for, the amount lost would be even more staggering.

For instance, only last week, Mumbai’s lifeline Mithi River swelled immensely due to a high tide situation, resulting in massive floods. In a first in several years, the western line rail tracks were also submerged during this period, while the flooding in Kurla was so bad that 1,500 people had to be evacuated.",flood,Mumbai Floods,"Mumbai, India",2005-07-26,2015-12-31,Mumbai Metropolitan Region,944 mm in 24 hours,"Rs 14,000 crore","3,000","Major infrastructure development rarely takes into account the level of hazard.

Central Railway Chief spokesperson Sunil Udasi said 1,050 passengers were safely evacuated without injuries from the train, which was stuck near Vangani, while the State Disaster Authority pegged the figure at 1,200, in what became the biggest joint operation in the state by the Indian Air Force, Army, Navy, the NDRF, state police, the Railway Police, local agencies, NGOs and volunteers since the July 26, 2005 floods.

Four National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams from different cities like Mumbai, Thane and Pune rushed to the train and evacuating the train passengers using eight inflatable rubber boats.

Besides, seven Indian Navy teams of divers with specialised equipment, a Seaking and MI-17 helicopters of the IAF, and two columns of Indian Army from Mumbai already in Thane and two more en route, were also deployed for the massive operations. Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai called up Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and offered all help from the Centre.

The rescue operation picked up pace post-noon when rain subsided a little, enabling quicker movement of personnel and the evacuated passengers carrying their luggage and minor children to safer spots.

Many weary passengers attempted to walk, but when they, especially the senior citizens, lost strength, police and other rescuers promptly hoisted them on their shoulders and took them to safety.

A few local villagers, many of whom were also stranded in the flood waters, also ventured out to help the train passengers early in the day before the official rescue teams from Mumbai, Thane and Pune reached the venue.

The passengers were brought off the train into boats and taken to a small village around 1.5 km away where the villagers welcomed them with water, hot tea and biscuits and even carried their luggage and the kids.

From there the passengers boarded buses, tempos and smaller vehicles to go to Badlapur, seven km away. A fleet of ambulances with three dozen doctors including gynaecologists were deployed there to tackle any emergency.

Nine-month pregnant, Reshma T. Kamble, who went into labour, was shifted to the Shushrut Hospital in Badlapur where she is now under observation.

The Central Railway then ferried the rescued passengers by a local train to Kalyan where a 19-coach special train was kept ready to take them to Kolhapur, famed for its Goddess Mahalaxmi Temple. A railway official also said that the authorities were also ready to take those passengers who so wanted back home to various destinations in Mumbai.

A group of senior citizens, who were proceeding on a pilgrimage to Kolhapur, decided to cancel their plans and return to Mumbai.

""We are very thankful to all the rescue agencies and the villagers who took great pains to help and rescue us. Now, we are very tired by this ordeal and will complete our pilgrimage later,"" one of them told media persons.

Fadnavis had instructed Chief Secretary Ajoy Mehta to personally monitor the evacuation operations and coordinate with various agencies engaged in the rescue works.

The Chief Minister also said that the district administration had made arrangement for meals, tea and freshwater at the Sahyadri Mangal Karyalaya and other locations in villages on the route between the stranded train and Badlapur.

Meanwhile, the CR also said that it would also decide later how to shift the train and clear the tracks for restoring the train traffic on that route, as water considerably receded by evening and the adjacent railway track was visible for the first time.

In Thane, around 550 people stranded in the towns of Kalyan, Dombivali, Badlapur and Titwal were also saved from the floodwaters by the rescue teams till this evening.

Thane Guardian Minister Eknath Shinde took a boat and went on an inspection tour of the affected areas in Vangani and its surroundings.

Rain continued to lash the coastal districts and many towns were practically underwater since early on Saturday as flooding local rivers and other water bodies overflowed into residential areas.

The busy Mumbai-Goa Highway was blocked this afternoon after a landslide near Khed. There are no immediate reports of any casualties.

Mumbai Airport operations suffered from the cancellation of 11 flights and nine diversions early on Saturday, but the situation returned to normal by 9 a.m., official sources said.

While Mumbai's lifeline, the suburban trains functioned with delays of 15-20 minutes on Western Railway and CR, the latter had to cancel services between Karjat-Kalyan (in Thane) owing to floods and waterlogging on the tracks since Friday.

Though the country's commercial capital continued to get intermittent showers, the worst-hit were Thane and Ratnagiri with towns of Ulhasnagar, Murbad, Badlapur, Tiwala, Vangani, Khed, Mangaon, Mandangad, Chiplun and surroundings practically submerged.

Heavy rain lashed Palghar, Pune and Nashik on Saturday, with the IMD forecasting similar weather for the next couple of days in the entire coastal regions including Mumbai.

The incessant downpour has, so far, claimed at least five lives, according to various news reports. Search is also on for four people who have been washed away. Authorities have asked people in Mumbai and surrounding areas not to venture near the sea and avoid waterlogged areas. Mumbai residents can call on 1916 for assistance.

Daily life was disrupted in the week and most offices, colleges, and schools were shut on Sept. 05 and on Sept. 04. With essential services like power supply being hit, the annual Ganpati festivities in Mumbai and the adjoining districts of Thane, Palghar and Raigad were also stalled.

The city is unlikely to get any respite from the flooding in the coming days as well. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a “red alert” forecasting intense rain in the city and surrounding areas in the next 24 hours.National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) teams have been kept on standby to meet any emergency. About 1,300 people living on the banks of the Mithi river have been shifted by the NDRF, fire brigade, and police after water levels crossed the danger mark.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the Railways have also set up relief camps for stranded people.

Flight operations at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, one of India’s busiest, too, were disrupted. Yesterday (Sept. 05), 30 flights were cancelled and more than 118 flights were delayed.

India’s largest carrier IndiGo suspended operations due to paucity of manpower on Sept. 04. Though it resumed operations yesterday, the airline cautioned fliers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. “There are few cancellations to stabilise the operations. All affected passengers are being accommodated on alternate flights,” it said in a statement.

Other regions of Maharashtra state, too, have been hit. More than 100 villages in Gadchiroli and Gondia in the Vidarbha region and several others in Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg of the Konkan region have been cut off.

By sparing land just 1% the size of Bandra-Kurla Complex,"On June 18, Upper Vaitarna, one of the few lakes that provide water to Mumbai, hit zero. Appeals of saving water trickled across the city and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation assured citizens that it would dip into its safety stock in other lakes. When monsoon finally arrived, it came with the decade’s highest 24-hour rainfall. Mumbai was flooded – trains, buses and flight services disrupted, and 32 people dead.

But no one was surprised. “It happens every year. A couple of days ago we barely had any water and now the city is waterlogged,” said Prashant Patil, a resident of a Northern suburb in Mumbai.

From Mexico City to Chennai, the world is experiencing a unique problem: cities that flood in one season and run dry in another. And the local governments are not without fault.

On July 2, the day Mumbai saw the decade’s highest rainfall in 24 hours, the BMC’s water pumping stations were on overdrive. BMC tweeted that its six pumping stations “pumped out more than 14,000 million litres of water and discharged it into the sea which is more than combined (sic) capacity of Tulsi and Vihar Lake”.

Patil asked, “If they can pump it out to the sea, can they not store it?”

Possible solutions

Many citizens are asking the same question, and some, like Subhajit Mukherjee, are executing cost-effective plans to implement rainwater harvesting kits. But small-scale rainwater harvesting, albeit a welcome step, might not solve the city’s flooding and freshwater depletion woes.

“We need large underground tanks to store rainwater,” says Jagdeep Desai, an architect. Desai is imagining a solution similar to Tokyo’s $3-billion flood control project – the G-Cans, or the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel. It consists of five giant cisterns and a 6.5 km-long tunnel that leads to a huge underground storage tank to overwrite Tokyo and its suburbs’ dreadful history with floods. This engineering marvel has managed to reduce flooding by half.

Can a similar model work for Mumbai?

Drain into the soil

Mumbai expanded by reclaiming land from the sea and levelling its mangroves. The topography of the expansion now prevents natural drainage. Like other Indian cities, Mumbai relies on its British-era stormwater drains to divert precious rainwater to the sea, instead of storing it. “At the moment we are pumping water from, say, Mulund, a Northern suburb in Mumbai, all the way to the Arabian sea through these drains,” Desai argues. “It’s simply not going to work.”

Here’s where the Tokyo model can be imitated in principle, if not in investment. “Instead of draining water into the sea, it could be discharged into an underground storage or into the soil to replenish groundwater,” Desai says. He believes that the project is achievable but it would prove to be a megaproject, comparable to the ongoing city-wide metro construction, unparalleled in requirements of civil engineering, cost and time required.

The demand, however, should not be for more pumping stations but to revive drains which can solve the dual problem of flooding and water scarcity. BMC has been promising an overhaul of the city’s drainage system through the Brihanmumbai Stormwater Disposal System project but 14 years and Rs 4,000 crore later, the project is still incomplete.

Stormwater wetlands

There are small, easily implementable urban design and planning solutions that can reduce flooding. “Simply ensuring that residential and commercial buildings are a few inches higher than the road,” Desai said, is one of them. But urban researchers are thinking of designing whole new wetlands.

Wetlands have been around a long time but urbanisation destroyed them. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have found that wetlands, which provide water treatment, flood protection, carbon storage, habitat, recreation and aesthetic value, can be constructed anew keeping desired hydraulic flow and ecology in mind.

Once again, we can look at Japan for inspiration. Watarase-yusuich is Japan’s artificial 3,300-hectare wetland in the Kanto Plains. It is designed to have a retention basin which holds – and treats – large amounts of floodwater.

Retention basins are like artificial lakes that are meant to manage stormwater runoff. These imitate natural wetlands and combine chemical treatment and natural plants – such as the use of reeds – as a filter for the water. These can be strategically designed and placed in low-lying areas to stop water from flooding the streets.

It’s a misconception that wetlands cannot be created in congested cities as shown by Chiba, another Japanese wetland, surrounded by high-rises.

Even when there are no floods, the wetlands host a variety of migratory birds. It also doubles as public space for people to cycle and enjoy water sports – a far better use of tax money than Mumbai’s planned coastal road project.

Coastal wetlands

The best example of creating wetlands for flood control comes from the suburb of Urrbrae in Australia’s Adelaide metropolitan area. The six-hectare wetland was created in the Urrbrae Agricultural High School. Lined by native plants, this wetland consists of two retention basins, one clay-lined pond and another synthetic-lined pond. It has managed to mitigate the flooding of local streets by diverting water into the retention basin and now, 400 million litres of stormwater passes through this wetland each year.

Sunil Agarwal, who identifies himself as an environment lover and is petitioning the government to save wetlands in Navi Mumbai, believes that the government land could be used to create wetlands in Mumbai. Educational institutions, too, as Adelaide shows us, are a good option. To put the size in perspective: 14 acres is barely 2% of the campus area of Mumbai’s Indian Institute of Technology or 1% of Bandra Kurla Complex.

“Spending money to construct a wetland might teach us their value and we might work harder towards saving existing wetlands,” Agarwal says.

Thus, in the absence of natural environmental defences, Mumbai needs to look at alternative design solutions to combat an increasingly worsening flooding problem. The inspiration for change may lie East.

(File)

Amid criticism of the Shiv Sena-controlled Mumbai municipality and the state government over the failure to check flooding in Mumbai, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India has compounded the woes of the ruling side.

In a report which was submitted to the state legislature on Tuesday, the CAG has raised serious questions over Mumbai’s monsoon preparedness, while passing strictures over delays in flood mitigation works.

While the Chief Minister claimed that the rainwater had receded faster than usual from low-lying belts, the CAG report, tabled on the same day, has red flagged deficiencies in the implementation of the multi-crore BRIMSTOWAD (Brihanmumbai Storm Water Drainage system) – meant to enhance the holding capacity of the SWD and the surface water run off coefficient. While the civic body has claimed that the carrying capacity of the drainage network had been upgraded from 25 mm/hour to 50 mm/hour and the run off coefficient had been enhanced to 0.5, the CAG report has disputed the claim. According to the CAG report, less than 48 per cent of the nullahs – 25 out of 53 – had been upgraded to 50 mm/hour capacity. “Out of 53 nullahs to be upgraded, 25 nullahs were upgraded to 50 mm/hr capacity. Work on 12 others was in progress, four was yet to started, and 12 others foreclosed,” he said. The BMC has spent several thousand crore since 2006 on the project. “There was a delay of six years in updating the BRIMSTOWAD master plan,” it has stated.

It has further pointed out that more than 26 percent work of the widening and deepening of the Mithi river work – 15.84 km out of 21.58 km – had been completed. Similarly, the works of Dahisar river (4.1 km completed out of 4.75 km), Poinsur (4 km out of 7 km), Oshiwara river (three out of eight nullahs) were still pending, it said.

Raising the issue of encroachments and land use along the flood plain zones, the CAG further observed, “There were numerous obstructions in the larger drains due to siphons and other utility services.” Claiming that the system is “heavily silted”, the CAG has also stated, “Floodgates have so far been provided in only three of the 45 outfalls. With tidal control possible at only these three locations, major outfalls discharge much below mean sea level.” Pointing out that flooding had become chronic to Mumbai, it has further observed that the “flat gradients have resulted in drains being affected by tides.”

It also listed poor workmanship and lack of attention to repairs when the drains are punctured by utility service providers and poor structural conditions as other major deficiencies in storm water drain management. While flooding is a chronic and recurrent problem in Mumbai during the monsoon season, “the process of urbanisation, however, has played a major role in aggravating the problem as it has caused significant alterations to hydrology, morphology, habitat and ecology of the area.”

Contending that there were 18497 hutments in 285 landslide-prone areas in Mumbai, the CAG has rapped the Mumbai municipality for lacking a concrete action plan for dealing with the issue. “There have been 100 landslides between 2010 and 2017, including 33 incidents that have taken place between 2015 and 2017.

But despite the repeated occurrences, the Mumbai municipality did not take any concrete action to mitigate the risk of landslides. The efforts made by authorities at various levels were not adequate and complete to address the preparedness for landslides.” While 5210 project affected people have been identified in 19 monsoon related workers, only 118 of them have been partially rehabilitated, while 5092 are yet to be resettled. Out of the 7654 buildings in the city that were aged over 30 years or more, only 1716 have carried out structural audit as mandated. Rapping the state government, the CAG has observed that the state’s annual disaster management plan (DMP) had not been updated since 2016. It has criticised the state for not included the school safety component in the state DMP, and for not identifying stampede, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear disasters as potential disasters.",issue,Mumbai Floods 2019,"Mumbai, India",July 2019,August 2019,"['Mumbai City', 'Mumbai Suburban', 'Thane', 'Palghar']","['200 mm, 250 mm, 300 mm']","['10 billion USD, 100,000 homes damaged, 100,000 people displaced']",['100'],"['transportation disruption, power outages, water contamination']","{'cause': 'heavy rainfall', 'mitigation_efforts': ['upgrade of drainage network', 'widening and deepening of rivers', 'construction of flood gates', 'removal of encroachments']}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Heavy monsoon rains are causing wall collapses that have killed 27 people in western India even as bad weather continues to disrupt road, rail and air traffic in the financial capital Mumbai, prompting officials to shut schools and offices.

During every monsoon season, which runs from June to September, India experiences fatal incidents of building and wall collapses as rainfall weakens the foundations of poorly-built structures.

Heavy rain brought a wall crashing down early on Tuesday morning on shanties built on a hill slope in Malad, a western suburb of Mumbai, a fire brigade official said. Eighteen people were killed in the incident.

{articleGUID}

“Rescue work is still going on,” the official added. “So far we have rescued more than two dozen people.”

Three people died when a school wall collapsed in the city of Kalyan, 42 kilometres north of Mumbai, late on Monday.

In the nearby western city of Pune, six people were killed in a wall collapse early on Tuesday, a fire brigade official said, after a similar incident on Saturday claimed 15 lives.

Mumbai is looking to turn itself into a global financial hub but large parts of the city struggle to cope with annual monsoon rains, as widespread construction and garbage-clogged drains and waterways make it increasingly vulnerable to chaos.

More than 300mm of rain fell over 24 hours in some areas of Mumbai, flooding streets and railway tracks, forcing the suspension of some suburban trains, which millions of commuters ride to work each day.

About 1,000 people stranded in low-lying areas of the city were rescued after a swollen river began to overflow, municipal authorities said.

As weather officials forecast intermittent heavy showers and isolated extremely heavy rainfall, authorities called a holiday for government offices and educational institutions.

“Rain is expected to remain intense even today,” city authorities said on Twitter. “We request you to stay indoors unless there’s an emergency.”

The Indian navy has deployed various teams for rescue and relief works in Mumbai.

Financial markets opened normally on Tuesday, though trading volumes were expected to be lower than usual. Many firms asked their employees to work from home.

The main runway at Mumbai airport, India’s second-biggest, was closed from midnight after a SpiceJet flight overshot the runway while landing, an airport spokeswoman said.

The secondary runway is operational, but 55 flights were diverted and another 52 were cancelled due to bad weather, she said.

US agency hired to study city floods (2005 to 2015) submits reportThe report also says this about’s planners – “major infrastructure development rarely takes into account the level of hazard.”(Doesn’t this apply to the ongoing debate around cutting Aarey trees?)Mumbai lost Rs 14,000 crore between 2005 and 2015 to fl oods caused by heavy rains, a report by the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and top accounting fi rmhas revealed.The floods also left 3000 people dead during this period, including over a thousand who perished in the July 26, 2005 deluge when the city received 944 mm of rain in 24 hours, a 100-year high, the report says.This is the first time a figure has been put to the devastation that Mumbai suffers every year in the rainy season. While USTDA and KPMG focused on 2005 to 2015, the city has been brought to a complete halt multiple times in every rainy season since.This year already, rains have brought Mumbai to its kneesJust last week, the Mithi in spate combined with high tide, leading to massive flooding. Even Western Railway tracks went under water, a first in many years. Worst, however, was reserved for, where there was waist-deep water and 1500 people from Krantinagar had to be evacuated. The study, instituted by the Relief and Rehabilitation Department of the state government in March 2019, interestingly, observes that “major infrastructure development rarely takes into account the level of hazard.”This is exactly what environmentalists have been shouting hoarse over as they oppose the state government’s decision to build a car shed for Metro 3 line at Aarey Colony. The car shed will not only lead to felling of over 2700 fully grown trees, the concretisation of the area, which currently acts as a holding pond during heavy rains, will increase the water flow into the Mithi, leading to floods worse than witnessed last week. The report also says that “vulnerable areas prone to disasters are not being identified.”The report titled ‘Flood Management and Vulnerability Assessment tofor’ was submitted to the government last month.It suggests that an integrated platform be developed to share and analyse information collected from various sources. The report says that some tools like “drones, satellite images and emergency mobile apps” can be used to get early alerts.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Click here

“To cater to urbanisation, industrialisation and the enormous growth of population, most of the city is covered in concrete,” said Darshan Sansare, lead author and research scholar, civil and environmental engineering department, VJTI. “Flooding in urban areas, particularly in Mumbai, is owing to these haphazard alterations in land use, land cover, escalation in the amount of precipitation (rainfall) by virtue of climate change and related impacts owing to other hydrological changes such as flooding.”

Integrating geographical information system and remote sensing, the analysis found that built-up area in Mumbai increased from 166.95 sq. km to 285 sq. km (72%) between 1973 and 2018, but with a simultaneous decrease in all other types of land use. Open spaces have reduced by 83% from 61.55 sq. km to 10 sq. km, followed by wetlands from 80 sq. km to 50.67 sq. km (48%), forests from 131.93 sq. km to 100.21 sq. km (25%), and water bodies from 29.74 sq. km to 23.47 sq. km (22%).

The study has also mapped approximately 72 flooding spots in the city. “Significant changes in land-use pattern coupled with high-intensity rain and high tide has led to an increase in flooding incidents in the city,” said professor Sumedh Mhaske, co-author and associate professor, civil and environmental engineering department, VJTI. “This is because rainwater cannot percolate into concrete surfaces, and neither do stormwater drains at present have the requisite carrying capacity to channel it into various waterways and the sea.”

The city’s existing stormwater drain system built during the colonial era can handle only 25mm rain an hour. With changing rainfall patterns, VJTI analysis considered 53.44mm rain an hour and found an increase in rainwater discharge from 3,207 cubic metre per second in 1973 (cu. m/sec) to 4,465cu. m/sec last year. The volume of run-off rain water in built-up areas has increased from 2,353 cu.m /sec to 4,029cu.m/sec, while it decreased in open spaces (from 365cu.m/sec to 64cu.m/sec) and forests (489cu.m/sec to 372cu.m/sec).

But here’s the situation on ground – only six of the 186 outfalls in Mumbai are above the hide tide level that can drain water during a heavy rain high-tide situation. Majority of the outfalls lie below 14 metres, which is the average elevation of Mumbai.

With 135 outfalls above mean sea level, but below the high tide level, 46 outfalls are below mean sea level, and the 2,000km roadside open drain system that are mostly clogged with plastic and waste, the study states “flash floods and high tides cause most of the outfalls to submerge under the sea water leaving it useless for disposal of city water.”

As a measure to mitigate flooding and its impacts, the two-member team recommends the use of pervious or permeable concrete on pavements and sidewalks, which will allow rainwater to percolate into the ground.

“Using pervious concrete will also help recharge ground water and reduce the burden on the existing stormwater drains. It can also minimise the impact of urban heat islands, as the material absorbs sun’s radiation,” said Sansare, who is developing his own pervious concrete mix and plans to test it on campus.

Professor Subhankar Karmakar, Centre for Environmental Science and Engineering, IIT- Bombay, said pervious concrete is a practical solution. “Pervious concrete can be used in new cities that are planned. However a feasibility study needs to be undertaken since Mumbai has a very uneven terrain and is also an unplanned city whose sidewalks and footpaths are encroached upon,” said Karmakar, who was not involved in the study.

212,212,mumbai,2019,https://thewire.in/urban/mumbais-coastal-reclamation-project-the-likelihood-of-a-not-so-natural-disaster,11 Apr 2019,Mumbai's Coastal Reclamation Project – The Likelihood of a Not-So-Natural Disaster,"Two weeks ago, on March 15, a cyclone tore through Beira, Mozambique’s fourth largest city. Cyclone Idai – turbocharged by the climate changed, warmer waters of the Indian Ocean – brought large scale flooding to the region, destroying 90% of Mozambique’s fourth largest city in a matter of two days.

This was just the most recent in a series of now normal superstorms and floods that have ravaged coastal cities like Chennai, New Orleans, Mumbai, New York City, Jakarta, Beira over the last two decades.

As the list of cities reeling from catastrophic floods gets longer, urban planners wonder – where will disaster strike next and what can be done about it?

Writing after Hurricane Katrina, which destroyed over 70% of the city of New Orleans in 2005, Neil Smith insisted that “there is no such thing as a natural disaster”. Disasters, he argued, were the results not just of wind and rains, but the ways in which these interact with urban policy, infrastructure and social vulnerability.

Disasters are created by negligence towards the social and natural contexts of large infrastructure projects. As Mumbai dramatically changes its coastline with the construction of a Rs 12,000-crore coastal road project, a careful review of the project documents suggests that the city may be involved in constructing a massive, not-so-natural disaster in the not too distant future.

The first phase the Mumbai Coastal Road Project, stretching from Marine Drive to Worli, proposes to fill in a total of 90 hectares of land into the sea. On this landfill (also called reclamation), the city proposes, not just to build a road, but also car parking structures, jogging tracks, a bus depot and other amenities.

Built on the coastline, at the interface of land and sea, the landfill will be constructed six meters above the sea level, and will call for the modification of storm water infrastructures that currently empty into the sea. These networks are an important part of the partly functional flood control system of the city.

Yet despite the ways in which Mumbai is already extremely vulnerable to flooding, the city has not as yet conducted a serious study of the ways in which the reclaimed coastline and its road will interact with heavy monsoon rains and rising high tides. Will the coastal road, once complete, exacerbate urban flooding with heavier rains and the displaced, rising sea?

As residents in Mumbai have long known, the city regularly floods when heavy rain showers occur during high tides in the monsoon months. This knowledge is now also amply evident in government reports. For example, a TERI Environmental Status Report, commissioned by the MMRDA in 2015, finds that water logging in the region “is essentially a compounded impact of heavy rainfall and high tides together”.

The 2006 Flood Fact Finding report of the Maharashtra State Government, pointed out floods ensue when “moderate intensity rainfall takes place close to the high tide period”. Finally, the Environmental Impact Assessment of the Coastal Road Project itself stated, “The problem of flooding is acute when heavy rainfall coincides with high tide”, which according to the report is approximately 20 times every monsoon. “If the rain intensity is more than 25 mm per hour and high tide occurs, there is always a possibility of flooding” (Coastal Road Drainage Report).

Yet these reports only detail the present vulnerability of the city to floods. According to a World Bank white paper (2008), the city will experience ever more frequent and intense floods in the near future with climate change. The number of days of intense rainfall in Mumbai have already increased in line with the climate change predictions.

As per the TERI MMRDA report, the number of heavy rain days have increased by 27% and very heavy rain days have increased by 24%. The city will flood more, and more frequently, with the intensification of rainfall.

There is also ample evidence now that the high tides will be higher owing to an accelerating sea level rise caused by rising sea surface temperatures and melting polar ice. The Arabian Sea is already warmer by 1 degree centigrade. As per the National Institute for Oceanography, mean sea level rise on the western coast of India was just over 1 mm/ year for most of the 20th century.

Yet, as per the most recent IPCC report, global sea level rise is accelerating and will likely increase by between 400 and 800 mm by 2100. While this number may seem small, it adds a significant punch to storm surges. With temperatures rising faster than the more conservative estimates of the IPCC reports, the Coastal Road EIA suggests that “the city of Mumbai needs to prepare itself against any natural calamities likely to occur in future”. Less clear in that document, however, is how the road, to be built on landfill, may either assist or impede these preparations.

Also Read: The Coastal Road is an Expensive Mistake Mumbai Should Avoid

Landfill has, on one hand, produced significant ground for Mumbai in the last 200 years. Yet, with climate change, the city cannot continue to reclaim land, because, as several government reports have also documented, reclamation also makes the city vulnerable to flooding. For instance, the Coastal Road DPR points out that reclamations of the Mithi River and Mahim exacerbated the Mumbai floods of 2005.

Today, “there are 40 chronic flooding locations… that are spread over the island city, eastern and western suburbs”. Many of these locations are located on reclaimed land. With sea level rise and intensified rainfall, we can expect there to be significantly more locations to develop in the future. Climate change, apart from being an environmental issue, is an urban issue, where it produces increased vulnerability to large scale flooding and disaster, that will affect the lives of many, if not most city residents.

This is why the city needs to carefully evaluate whether new infrastructure projects will make the city even more vulnerable to flooding. Unfortunately, the reports commissioned by the MCGM for the coastal road project have not done this work. Instead of assessing the impacts of the road on the urban environment, MCGM studies are focused on the impact of the urban environment on the road.

For instance, to address rising sea levels and storm surges, the road is proposed to be constructed higher at 6 meters above sea level. This, combined with regular resurfacing, is supposed to ensure that the probability of flooding of the Coastal Road remains low (Risk Assessment and Disaster Management Plan). While many of the measures listed in project documents may reduce the risk of the road flooding, the road may increase the problems of flooding in adjacent low-lying areas.

What does the elevated road do to reclaimed neighbourhoods like Prabhadevi, Tardeo and Warden Road; neighbourhoods that are between 1m and 5m above mean sea level? How will intense rainfalls in the city leave these neighbourhoods through drains that need go through reclaimed land, higher sea walls and higher sea levels?

Also Read: Will Mumbai Lose Its Sea Front?

We don’t know. This is because the BMC has, to date, not conducted a single integrated study exploring how the road will interact with the rough seas and rain every monsoon. The Disaster Management Plan does not investigate the impact of the road on low lying neighbourhoods. To be sure, MCGM has commissioned a hastily conducted drainage study, and also a separate study of storm surges, tides and tsunamis conducted by a different agency.

But flooding events ensue when drainage and wave action interact. Neither study has explored the relationship between road, rain, drainage and sea. Thus, the study on storm surges examines sea level rise, but does not account for the intensification of rainfall in its models. Rain is not even mentioned in its report.

The Drainage Report tacitly acknowledges that storm water drains are not very functional at high tide. Then, it goes on to account for rainfall intensity, but does not account for tides or sea level rise upon which drainage depends. Based on study terms set out by the BMC, both reports produce an incomplete and dangerous understanding of the city’s urban ecology. Both reports ignore the effect of intense rains on a city in a sea. With its partial blindness emerging from its determination to build a road, the BMC is ignoring how it may also be building conditions for a flood.

Experts agree that increased likelihood of extreme weather events associated with climate change today make Mumbai one of the riskiest cities to inhabit in the world. The city needs to urgently rethink and put in place not just disaster management plans, but infrastructures that reduce the city’s exposure to these risks. Today, however, the city is doing less than nothing to address its ecological and social vulnerabilities to climate change, storm surges and flooding.

By radically altering the city’s coastline through reclamation and infrastructure construction without even so much as examining and addressing the impacts of this project on an intensification of urban flooding in the future, it is actively being engaged in the long-term production of a “natural” disaster.

Economic losses due to extreme flooding will soar 166 times more by 2050, unless world's coastal megacities adapt to a climate change, warned a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

India's financial capital, Mumbai, will also be among those bearing the brunt, according to the IPCC’s Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC).

In fact, floods in the city between 2005 and 2015 caused a loss of Rs 14,000 crore, according to a study submitted to Maharashtra government last month.

Currently, the cities lying in the coastal region, with over 10 million populations, are losing at least $6 billion every year. But, without an effective coping or adaptation plan in place, they will likely lose at least $1 trillion annually by the middle of this century, noted the IPCC report.

Besides megacities, developing small and mid-sized cities are also vulnerable to extreme floods, according to the report. Even though they are growing at a much faster rate, they are the least prepared due to limited finances and lack of political will, noted the report.

More than half the global population live in cities, most of which are located in low-lying islands and coasts. They will be affected by sea level changes, storms and other weather and climate-related hazards.

Extreme floods will degrade the coastal landscape and as a result of this, the real estate value of the coastal property will decline, the report stated.

This means that property owners will earn less from rentals of the properties. Business, too, will be prone to loss in such regions resulting in decrease in local employment. As a result, the availability of insurance, will also be impacted.

In fact, Mumbai in 2005 floods reported one of the largest insurance loss ever in India — $0.9 billion, according a report by Swiss Re Institute.

The impact of floods will also affect coastal cities that are centres of global trade. It will impact their regional and national economy, warned the IPCC report. In 2011 floods in Bangkok caused a direct loss of $46.5 billion to Thailand's economy, while the supply chains across the globe were also disrupted.

The report also showed that sea level may rise 1.1 metre by 2100, if countries are not able to restrict emissions “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as stated in the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

This is likely to have a direct impact on the lives of 680 million people living in low-lying coastal zones, the report warned.

Hence, it advocates for transformative adaptation, which includes fundamental modifications in the policies, policy-making processes, institutions, human behaviour and cultural values.

Urbanisation can also provide an opportunity for reducing the risks, claims the report. Cities could be developed as “centres of innovation” with political will and engaging private sector, while innovative approach to create “climate resilient cities” is an urgent need of the hour, stated the report.

Stakeholders like government, the private sector, civil society, affected communities and scientific community, all must come together to bring out transformational changes in the adaptation and mitigation options in view of the climate that is undoubtedly changing.",issue,Mumbai floods,"Mumbai, India",2005,2015,Mumbai,"14,000 crore",$6 billion,,"loss of real estate value, business, employment, insurance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe
215,215,mumbai,2019,https://india.mongabay.com/2019/10/salt-pans-save-mumbai-from-floods-so-why-are-they-under-threat/,14 Oct 2019,Salt pans save Mumbai from floods. So why are they under threat?,"Mumbai has about 5,300 acres of salt pan land and of that, about 1,800 acres may soon be opened up for a central government scheme providing low-cost housing projects.

While the dominant partner of the current ruling alliance, the Bharatiya Janata Party, has already cleared its intentions to open up the land, its ally Shiv Sena is strictly against it.

Environmentalists believe opening up of salt pans for real estate development could result in adverse impact to the city’s ecology as salt pans act as a natural barrier to flooding among other ecological benefits.

In the run-up to the Maharashtra legislative assembly elections on October 21, 2019, the state’s Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, has announced several projects to woo voters. But one such announcement that went under the radar was the opening up of Mumbai’s ecologically sensitive salt pans for the development of low-cost housing.

In Mumbai, which is perennially land-starved, the salt pans are few of the remaining land parcels on which no development has happened so far. These environmentally sensitive land parcels have been under strict Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules which restrict development. But with the BJP having a strong majority at the centre and in Maharashtra, this may change.

The low-cost housing project has been high on the agenda of the NDA government since it first came to power in 2014. Even during the 2019 election campaign, the Prime Minister had reiterated the promise of providing low-cost housing in the years ahead. The government has been scouting potential land parcels across the country which could be opened for development.

A senior Maharashtra government official, while requesting anonymity, explained that in the past few months, the BJP-led Maharashtra state government has given a green signal to the centre to put salt pans in the concurrent list of the Constitution of India. “This will empower the state to make its own laws for the use and development of salt pans. Before this, the jurisdiction of salt pans came under the union commerce and industry ministry and state government did not have any authority over them,” said the official. In the past as well, the Maharashtra government has expressed its desire to open-up salt pans for development in Mumbai.

Mumbai has a total of 5,300 acres of salt-pan lands and this entire area was marked as wetlands. In 2016, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) conducted a study and gave a report that only 25 acres of these 5,300 acres of salt-pan land are developable.

The location of these salt pans is important because they act as natural barriers to prevent flooding in Mumbai. Along with mangroves, salt pans hold the seawater from entering the city and stop flooding. They are visited by several species of birds and different types of insects thrive on them as well.

However, with the new amendments by the government, a huge chunk of these wetlands will get de-notified and opened for developmental projects. The revision of the Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules in 2017 and changes to Mumbai’s Development Plan (DP) 2034, indicate that the government is working towards acquiring the salt pans for its ambitious low-cost housing project. The 2017 Wetlands rules now state that salt-pan lands are no longer marked as wetlands which removes restrictions for development.

According to the final draft of the DP 2034, 2,100 hectares of salt pan lands have been demarcated for the construction of one million affordable housing units, 1,100 hectares for tourism development and only 30 hectares for salt pans.

The opening up of salt pans could mean a huge setback to the fragile ecology of the area. As per the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification 2011, salt pans are ecologically sensitive areas falling under the category CRZ-1B, where no development activity is allowed, except exploration of natural gas and extraction of salts.

With Mumbai’s space challenges, a concession has been given to redevelop the NDZ (no development zone) areas under public-private partnerships (PPP) with the Floor Space Index (FSI) in line with the prevailing norms of the city.

If the plan goes through, out of the total of 5,300 acres, 1,781 acres of salt pans spread across the length and breadth of Mumbai will be opened up for development. In Mumbai, salt pans are situated in Mulund, Bhandup, Ghatkopar, Chembur, Wadala, Trombay, Jogeshwari, Malwani, Gorai, Bhayandar and Virar. These are locations on the eastern and western waterfronts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).

BJP’s ally Shiv Sena is against opening up of salt pans

Even though the BJP is pushing for the opening of salt pans, its ally Shiv Sena which is fighting the assembly elections together is against it.

“We have been against the opening of salt pans for development from the very beginning. We are very clear that there should be no development on salt pan lands. Shiv Sena is the only political party which is not interested in land grabbing. Shiv Sena is the only political party which is sensitive towards the environment,” Shiv Sena leader Manisha Kayande told Mongabay-India.

Kayande emphasised that their stand has always been clear that salt pan lands are very sensitive and are extremely fragile.

“The soil is porous which makes it almost impossible to build a concrete structure on. Also, the fear is that these vast tracts of land will be opened up in the name of low-cost housing and then someone will grab the land and develop it for private real estate. In a city like Mumbai, which is always prone to flooding, salt pans help in stopping the seawater from coming into the city. They are able to hold a large quantity of water from coming into the city,” she said.

The move to open up salt pans for development is significant for the real estate sector which, in Maharashtra and especially Mumbai, is closely linked to local politics.

However, a government structural engineer, who didn’t wish to be named, said all these concerns raised against allowing development works in salt pans are unfounded.

“Technology has advanced so much that now we can easily build strong concrete structures on these porous lands as well. Technology and modernisation have gone so far that we are able to build huge concrete structures on water, so we are sure that we can build on salt pans as well,” he said.

Salt pans are important for Mumbai and its ecology

Environmentalists are concerned about the proposal to open up these land parcels as they point out that they are very important for Mumbai’s ecology. Salt pans help in maintaining the ecological balance by supporting thousands of species of migratory birds.

“Salt pan lands fall under the CRZ-1 category because salt pan lands are situated within the low tide land and high tide land. Thanks to the CRZ rules, salt pan lands are protected and cannot be opened up for development,” Debi Goenka of the Conservation Action Trust told Mongabay-India.

“The low-cost housing project is not feasible. Building on salt pan land will incur additional costs. You have to do reclamation, you have to provide all the infrastructure because there is no infrastructure there. Water, drainage, electricity, everything has to be built from scratch. So these projects will be more difficult to execute and will be more expensive so there is no question of low-cost housing,” said Goenka.

He stressed that even the previous NDA government had floated this idea of low-cost housing 20 years ago. “Even then a high powered committee of ministers had studied the feasibility of the project but they were not able to execute it because it was clearly violating the CRZ laws,” he added.

Goenka stressed that the government “so far has not got any kind of clearance for opening the salt pans but “as and when any clearances are given and there is any kind of CRZ violation, we will challenge that in court.”

Stalin D., director of environmental NGO Vanashakti, stated that construction on salt pans basically means constructing on floodplains.

“For constructing, the level of the ground will have to be raised and this will result in severe flooding. It is not advisable. What the government is trying to do is relocate slum-dwellers from premium areas to remote areas and then hand over the premium areas to builders for development and open spaces are being exploited for this. Salt pans are protected under the CRZ rules and if they are destroyed then we will legally challenge the move,” Stalin said.

Many parts of Maharashtra will finally get a break from heavy rain, as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that the intensity of rainfall will reduce significantly from this weekend, especially over Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada and Vidarbha.

However, moderate rain may continue over Konkan for the next four days, said the IMD.

“The intensity of rainfall will reduce over most parts of Maharashtra. It will reduce further around August 15,” said a senior official from IMD, Pune.

The current spell of rain over the state has been one of the longest in history, with continuous heavy spells recorded since July 31. Till August 9, the state has received 35 per cent excess rain.

Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur, Pune and Mumbai have received very heavy rainfall in the last 10 days, creating flood-like situations in these districts and cities, and throwing life out of gear.

Even Marathwada, which has been in the rainfall deficient category for most of this monsoon season, also recorded normal rainfall. The rainfall in the sub-divisions in the state on Friday were — Madhya Maharashtra (73 per cent), Konkan (49 per cent), Vidarbha (2 per cent) and Marathwada (-15 per cent).

The rainfall recorded in Pune so far is 744.8 mm, much higher than its normal monsoon rainfall of 365.2 mm. The city has recorded 100 per cent excess rainfall this season so far, achieved mainly during this latest spell.

But after Saturday’s flooding, it seems like the hotspot for disasters.During the flooding of July 26, 2005, too, it was one of the worst-hit with 22 deaths. Exactly 14 years after 26/7, Badlapur residents relived similar moments.Photographs of flooded housing colonies in Valivali and Hendrepada, with only car roofs visible over the waters, were forwarded on social media even as residents tweeted about rising water levels reaching first-floor houses.

Reworking of the RRZ (River Regulation Zone) rules five years ago had resulted in a flurry of construction right in the floodplain of Ulhas river, they said.In 2015, government scrapped the River Regulation Zone policy as it hampered industrial expansion.

Accommodated at the school when Dungi went under four feet of water, the villagers have now been given an ultimatum by CIDCO, the nodal agency for the NMIA project. If they want state assistance for their relocation, they have to drop all negotiations and accept the rehabilitation package right now. “We have been told that if we go back, we will not get any help from CIDCO,” said Ajeet Naik (45), a resident of Dungi and a member of the Pargaon gram panchayat.

For three years now, the residents of Dungi, one of the 12 villages in Raigad district that are to be displaced by NMIA, have kept up a stiff resistance against the acquisition of their agricultural land and homes.

But with land all around their villages now acquired for the new airport, their will had begun to weaken this summer when, acknowledging that Dungi would be inundated in the monsoon, they had approached CIDCO. That was in April, and they were asked to wait.

But Monday night’s rain and the consequent flood led them to be moved to safer ground in Karanjade with the bare minimum belongings they could carry at a short notice. “This feels like them using an act of nature to force us out of our land,” said Radhabai Patil (72), who sells homemade rotis for a living. “I know we can’t stay there. But I have lived in the village all my life, I was born there, got married and widowed there. I can’t just start afresh,” she added.

CIDCO officials helped the flood-hit residents of Dungi settle at the Karanjade school, where classes are continuing on the first and second floor. “They’ve told us that if we start looking for alternative accommodation right now, their offer is Rs 50,000 for four months and then rent for 18 months thereafter. After that, they will give us three times the amount of land we had, but we don’t know where. None of these promises are binding and even they don’t know if they will be able to find us land,” Sanjeev Naik, another resident said.

For 52-year-old Savita Bhoir, Monday night was the scariest of her life. “I have lived all my life in Dungi, and I have seen it waterlogged before. But I have never seen water like that. I am taller than most women and the water was reaching my chest. I was worried about my ailing mother,” she said.

Bhoir, a head nurse with a private hospital in Navi Mumbai, is now taking shelter at the school with her family. School-going children, senior citizens, ailing residents, all arrived late Monday with the most basic belongings. “Because of the airport work, land around our village has been raised so much that we are going to get flooded by water flowing down from there every year,” she said.

Anticipating this situation, residents had approached CIDCO a couple of months ago. “We realised that we will always flood as the water from the higher land will accumulate on our land. But CIDCO asked us to wait. And now they are telling us not to go back at all and to find new accommodation immediately,” said Lahuji Patil (50).

CIDCO Vice-Chairman and Managing Director Lokesh Chandra denied that the agency is taking advantage of the villagers’ current plight. “This is not us taking advantage of a bad situation. It was a decision taken two months ago. The villagers had been told everything and they had agreed about the terms of relocation.

222,222,mumbai,2019,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/mumbai-rains-maharashtra-flooding-flooding-5859105/,29 Jul 2019,Explained: What caused weekend flooding outside Mumbai; what can be done?,"The eastern part of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) was inundated over the weekend after the townships of Kalyan, Ulhasnagar, Murbad and Ambernath all received around 300 mm rain in the 24 hours ending 8 am on July 27. Almost exactly a year earlier, the twin satellite towns of Vasai-Virar had been all but cut off from Mumbai for two days as floods snapped rail and road links.

The MMR, which sprawls over more than 10 times the geographical area of Mumbai, is dotted by semi-rural areas and municipalities that sometimes serve as dormitory townships for India’s financial capital. What makes this coastal urban agglomeration prone to flooding of the kind seen in Thane district over Friday and Saturday?

Reckless construction

Many of Mumbai’s satellite towns are located along the Kalu, Ulhas, Waldhuni, and Bhatsa rivers that shimmy down the MMR, passing through thickly populated areas including Ulhasnagar, Titwala, Badlapur, Vithalwadi, and Ambernath. All these areas have seen a massive spurt in construction activity over the past two to three decades — and almost all these rivers have the problems that come with unplanned urbanisation: encroachments, illegal sand dredging, dumping of effluents, and construction activity on their floodplains.

Advertisement

A March 2015 study prepared for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) reported that forest cover in the MMR had fallen from about a third of the total area in 1987 to 21% in 2015. Wastelands, floodplains, mangrove areas, all have seen construction activity. Saturday’s overhead images from Naval choppers showed the Mahalaxmi Express marooned in what seems to be the floodplains of the Ulhas river. Railway officials say the line was originally a good distance away from the river’s buffer areas, but unplanned construction along both banks has rendered the tracks vulnerable to submergence when the river is in spate, with the city’s drains emptying into the railway areas simultaneously.

Worst-affected rivers

The Mithi in spate caused much of the havoc on July 26, 2005, when a cloudburst dumped 944 mm of rain on Mumbai within a span of 24 hours; the overflowing Ulhas is likely to be blamed for parts of Ulhasnagar going under on Friday evening and Saturday.

Picnickers at a resort on its banks had to be rescued. The river passes through Badlapur and Vangani, where the dramatic rescue of train passengers took place.

The winding Ulhas flows 120-plus km from its source in the Sahyadris to the Arabian Sea via Vasai creek, passing the picturesque Karat and Neral regions, and receiving waters from as far as the Palasdhari dam, the Poshir river, Chikoli dam, Barvi dam, before merging with the confluence of the Bhatsa and Kalu rivers. Multiple areas along its banks — Shahad, Ambivali, Dombivali, Kongaon, Mothagaon, Ambernath, Ulhasnagar and Badlapur — were affected on Friday and Saturday.

The Kalu river’s overflowing waters caused some parts of Titwala to be flooded, while the much less urbanised Vasind-Asangaon area were inundated by overflow from the Bhatsa river.

What can be done?

Will cleaning up these rivers reduce the likelihood of floods?

There are over 20 reservoirs/dams within the municipal limits of urban local bodies in the MMR. Modaksagar and Tansa, which serve Mumbai, were already overflowing. Villages on the banks of the Vaitarna river had been issued their annual warning over a week back. On Sunday, one floodgate of the Middle Vaitarna Dam, located further north on the Vaitarna river, was opened.

But downstream villages along the banks of these rivers are no longer alone in danger of inundation. As natural adaptation and flood resilient geography is broken down by unplanned construction activity. Holding ponds, mangroves, wetlands, salt pan lands, and other buffers have disappeared. Much of the devastation in Vasai-Virar on the two days of flooding in July 2018 was linked to the choking of the creek areas, and at least some of the latest flood-related damage will be found connected to the upstream damage to the rivers’ ecology.

The 13 west-flowing rivers and their 21 tributaries are important natural floodwater drainage systems for the region. At a wider level, the problem of where the MMR gets its drinking water also comes into play — multiple dams on these rivers are in various stages of construction or planning, including the Kalu, Shai, Gargai, Pinjal, Poshir and Barvi dams. The unplanned densification of townships downstream of these dams makes the responsibilities of these municipalities that much more grave.

The population of the ‘Rest of MMR’, excluding Mumbai, has grown from 18 lakh in 1971 to 106 lakh according to the 2011 Census, a number that does not account for more recent additions of peri-urban areas into the MMR. Decadal growth rate of population for parts of the MMR excluding Mumbai was found to be nearly 55 per cent. There are also large industrial belts in the MMR — those across the TTC (Trans-Thane Creek) area, Taloja, Waghle Estate, Dombivali, Ambernath, Bhiwandi, etc.

An overhaul of municipal amenities in these regions, planned in a holistic way that takes into account sustainable water needs, sustainable water supply solutions, likely floodwaters from new reservoirs and dams in the region, maintaining buffer zones that are no-go areas for construction, will be the minimum requirement for flood-proofing this region.",flood,2019 Thane floods,"Thane district, Maharashtra, India",27 July 2019,28 July 2019,"['Kalyan', 'Ulhasnagar', 'Murbad', 'Ambernath']",['300 mm'],"['Reckless construction', 'Encroachments', 'Illegal sand dredging', 'Dumping of effluents', 'Construction activity on floodplains']",['0'],"['Parts of Ulhasnagar went under', 'Picnickers at a resort on the banks of the Ulhas had to be rescued', 'Multiple areas along the banks of the Ulhas were affected', ""The Kalu river's overflowing waters caused some parts of Titwala to be flooded"", 'The much less urbanised Vasind-Asangaon area were inundated by overflow from the Bhatsa river']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

There were long jams on the Western Express Highway and other arterial roads like Linking Road in Khar and Bandra were waterlogged. Photo by Satish Malavade/ BCCL School Kids Stranded in Buses for Hours By the time the administration and the government could announce that in light of the heavy rainfall warning, schools would remain shut, most school children were already in their respective schools. The alert also triggered the process of figuring out how students could safely get back home, even as the rain continued to pelt the city. Some children took more than 5 hours to get home, negotiating waterlogged roads and fighting hunger.

Due to continuous and heavy rains, local train services were suspended between CSMT-Thane on the main line; CSMT-Vadala/Andheri/Goregaon; Vadala-Mankhurd on harbour line and Belapur-Kharkopar on the 4th corridor. Services are running on Mankhurd-Panvel, Thane-Vashi/Panvel, Thane-Kasara/Karjat/Khopoli, Nerul-Khakopar-Nerul.

Train services were disrupted on the harbour line after waterlogging was reported on the tracks between Sion and Kurla. Central services are operating only on some portions of the entire line. CSMT is also a big hub for long distance trains. A number of long distance trains have been cancelled or short-terminated on account of the heavy rains.

Parents are wading with their kids through knee-deep water, and at the same time protecting them from getting drenched. The authorities have even announced that people who have waded through rainwater must visit a doctor and get themselves checked, as a number of diseases can spread during the monsoons.

Do you still want to cuttrees,As Mithi once again flooded Kurla and parts of Bandra (east) and BKC yesterday, serving a warning to the BMC to not touch trees at Aarey – which serves as a holding pond during heavy rains –it emerged that two independent experts on a panel appointed by the CM to suggest a site forhad voted for Kanjurmarg.The state governmentcontrolled Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL) wants to set up the car shed at Aarey and is willing to sacrifice 2702 trees for the same.Environmentalists and experts have, however, warned that concretisation of Aarey will lead more rain water running off into Mithi, leading to floods.The two experts -- Rakesh Kumar, director, National Environmental Research Institute (NEERI) and Shyam Asolekar, professor, IIT-B’s Centre for Environmental Science and Engineering, had said the recommended either Kanjurmarg or Backbay as ideal sites for the car shed.Mumbai Mirror quoted the same experts in its front page report on Wednesday, warning of a possibility of floods in Chakala and at the international airport.Yesterday, Mithi, combined with a high tide at 3.27 pm, lead to massive flooding of Western Railway tracks at Mahim and Matunga, a first in many years. But it reserved the worst for Kurla, where there was, and parts of Bandra (east) and BKC. So severe was the flooding in Kurla that 1500 people from Krantinagar had to be evacuated.While the hightide was certainly a contributing factor, by BMC’s own admission Mithi had already crossed the danger mark at 1.15 pm. Rakesh Kumar and Shyam Asolekar were the only two independent members of the committee set up by the CM. Everybody else was a government official, more than willing to toe its line.Overwhelmed by government representatives voting for Aarey, the two submitted a dissenting note, which said: “From environmental perspective we are convinced that the Kanjurmarg site and the Backbay site should be investigated further even though it may entail some delay and additional work. The Kanjurmarg site appears to be the best and Backbay site appears to be the second-best among those presented to us at this juncture. We sincerely believe Kanjurmarg and Backbay sites should be evaluated and then a call should be taken. The Aarey land is certainly not suitable due to its ecological significance.”The two experts, in fact, had argued that considering the government’s endeavour to expand Metro’s network, the construction of a car shed at a site like Aarey, which has limited scope for expansion, is not prudent.D Stalin, project director of environmental organisation Vanshakti, which is at the forefront of Save Aarey movement, asked why was the experts’ dissenting note not considered. “All other members on the committee were bureaucrats or financial experts. It is not a surprise that they weighed in with the government. It is precisely for this reason that independent experts are appointed on such panels,” he said.A text message sent to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis remained unanswered at the time of going to the press.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Rampant urbanisation in the Vasai-Virar belt has made it more prone to floods over the last decade, a study conducted by students of Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute of Architecture (KRVIA) shows. The study highlighted that between 2004 and 2019 the share of urban areas went up from 12% to 20% in the 380 sq.km. region.

The study showed that the increased concretisation resulted in cutting-off of natural streams originating from the hills on the east and flowing towards the coast. These streams functioned as a natural source of drainage to run-off water during monsoons. The team of 12 students, all pursuing their master’s, studied the area over four months and analysed its land-use pattern and water systems.

In July 2018, large parts of Vasai and Virar were submerged for a week following heavy rains. The city was cut-off from other parts of the State and Gujarat as there was severe waterlogging on the tracks. Railway officials said there was a drainage issue as water levels did not recede even after the rain stopped.

The study also noted that due to rampant urbanisation, groundwater levels in the region had depleted severely, resulting in an ingress of salt water from the sea. As a result, agricultural communities, traditionally dependent on wells, have been getting non-potable water for agricultural purposes.

The study was part of ‘Building Resilient Urban Communities’ (BReUCom), a joint studio project between KRVIA and seven other institutes in India and abroad. Other student teams belonging to first and second year master’s programmes have developed similar studies on various communities and spaces in the city such as Diva, Mumbra, informal settlements along Gazdarbandh nullah and the Kalbadevi-Bora Bazaar precinct. The studies were showcased at KRVIA as part of a symposium on urban resilience.",flood,Vasai-Virar floods,"Vasai-Virar, Maharashtra, India",July 2018,July 2018,Vasai and Virar,Heavy rains,Submerged for a week,,Cut-off from other parts of the State and Gujarat,"Due to rampant urbanisation, groundwater levels in the region had depleted severely, resulting in an ingress of salt water from the sea.

227,227,mumbai,2019,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-mumbai-rains-flooding-central-railways-5813975/,4 Jul 2019,Explained: Why the heavy rains stopped Central Railways in its tracks,"Mumbai recorded a decadal high rainfall of 375.22-mm rainfall in the suburbs which caused widespread flooding, loss of lives and a 16-hour shutdown of Central Railways. The CR, which is an important component of the Suburban Railways system, the lifeline of the city, came to a grinding halt even as its counterpart, the Western Railways, managed to operate its services. During the 2005 Mumbai deluge, CR had bore the brunt of the massive rains which had hit the city registering greater losses and disruptions compared to WR. The Indian Express finds out why CR services are more prone to be affected by monsoon and the steps it is taking to address the problem.

Officials say topographic conditions play a decisive role in making CR more susceptible to flooding than WR. The mean sea level of WR stations are a little higher. In contrast, the CR suburban rail line passes through low lying areas. The low lying flood-prone areas in Western line are Bandra, Santa Cruz, Matunga, Elphinstone and Nallasopara. On the Central line they include stations like Sion, Kurla, Vikhroli, Ghatkopar and on the Harbour line, the low lying areas are Sewri, Wadala and Chunabhatti.

However, on the Western line, the low lying areas are closer to the coast. The proximity of WR to the sea means that water accumulated in these stations gets discharged far more quickly through the BMC drains, which run from east to west, into the sea. On the other hand, the relative remoteness of Central line stations from the coast means the water takes time to drain out. The long distance that this water must travel from the Central line to the sea also makes it susceptible to obstruction and hindrances.

Is there a difference in drainage infrastructure of Western and Central railways?

The existing drainage system on railway lines constitutes of longitudinal drains constructed by the Railways, which are laid between tracks. These drains discharge water into the latitudinal drains of the BMC which cross the tracks and join the larger drains that discharge the water into the sea. The WR traditionally has had a better drainage system compared to CR. Over the last few years, the WR has further augmented these drains and also constructed additional cross-drains under the tracks in vulnerable areas to ensure faster discharge of water into BMC drains. The layout of BMC drains is such that their incline gets steeper as they get closer to the sea which allows faster dispersal of water. In case of CR, the incline of the BMC drains is relatively flat and the water does not gush out with a greater force. The CR has, however, been working on augmenting its drains as well. The WR also benefited from the massive cleanup drives and widening that the BMC undertook on Bandra’s Chamdawadi nullah and Dharavi’s Mukhyadhyapak nullah which led to easier dispersal of water.

What other infrastructure work has been carried out to stop flooding?

In order to prevent flooding the Railways has been working on lifting the height of tracks. Chronic flooding at Nallasopara had last year caused all suburban services between Bhayander and Virar to be suspended for over 24 hours. Since that fiasco, WR lifted the tracks by around 300 mm which meant that there was not much accumulation of water on the tracks this year and services were not disrupted. Officials say CR had also done a similar exercise to lift tracks in the flood-prone Sion Kurla stretch before the monsoon but it did not have the desired effect in stopping flooding due to the massive downpour. The CR also faces problems in raising the height of tracks compared to the WR as the height of certain existing Foot Over Bridges do not give it the required space clearance.

Why did CR come to a grinding halt on Monday and much of Tuesday?

CR officials say that services were stopped largely due to flooding in low lying areas in the Sion-Kurla and Chunabhatti-Tilak Nagar stretch. Officials say that the entire area is prone to waterlogging and water was pouring into the station from the surrounding low lying localities. Officials said that even pumping out water was not a solution as the water being pumped out was gushing back again. The BMC and Railways had to subsequently deploy two 50 HP pumps at Sion station which pumped the water up and discharged it on the Sion flyover.

Is CR prepared if a similar downpour hits the city in the coming days?

The CR has undertaken a drive to identify trouble-spots, officials say. Teams had been sent to survey the drains and find spots where waterlogging was severe. The CR has said that such bottlenecks will be cleaned up. Officials, however, say that the constant flooding is part of a larger urban planning problem. Officials claim that the problems may continue till there is no improved urban planning coordination between the various agencies that govern Mumbai.",issue,2019 Mumbai Floods,"Mumbai, India",25 July 2019,26 July 2019,"['Sion', 'Kurla', 'Vikhroli', 'Ghatkopar', 'Sewri', 'Wadala', 'Chhunawatti']",375.22-mm,16-hour shutdown of Central Railways,0,loss of lives,"The CR, which is an important component of the Suburban Railways system, the lifeline of the city, came to a grinding halt even as its counterpart, the Western Railways, managed to operate its services.

The duo is seen kicking the door and windows, but finding no way to escape. Their bodies were pulled out around 4am on Tuesday.

Shaikh, a resident of Kokanipada, and Khan, a resident of Pathanwadi in Malad (East), were returning home in the car which belonged to Khan’s boss, Abid Baig, a businessman.

A Malad police official said, “As the water was not very high initially, they thought the car will pass through the subway, but they misjudged.”

Khan’s aunt Sana Baig, told HT, “Their car got stuck around 11.15pm. They were not able to come out as the doors got locked and jammed. Irfan called Abid, who called his wife, who then called me.”

Baig rushed to the spot and saw the subway get submerged. “The fire brigade and the police came much later and did nothing for four hours, even as my relatives and I kept screaming. When we shouted at them, they shouted back at us. They feared if they jump in, they will either drown or get electrocuted,” she said.

“An hour later, a boat and divers came, but they were not of much use. Finally, around 3.30am, a local resident, Salman Shaikh, 27, dived into over 10ft water without caring for his life and located the Scorpio car and tied a rope to it. Over 20 people then pulled it out,” said Baig.

Salman, who works at a garment shop, told HT, “I am saddened by the response of the government authorities. I put my life on line as I could not bear it anymore. They need good swimmers. I located the car in 10 minutes and they, on the other hand, were saying no car was stuck there.”

Khan had worked as a driver in Saudi Arabia for nine years and returned to India eight months ago. He is survived by his wife and six children, aged 10 to 20, who live in Hyderabad. Shaikh is survived by three brothers, his wife and three kids –a 10-year-old girl, an eight-year-old son and a one-year-old daughter.

Shaikh had a belt and purse stall in Malad. Shaikh’s younger brother Irfan told HT: “There was no barricade. The incident took place near police chowky and RTO office. During the first rain on June 10, I saw water rise up to 10ft there. Was the BMC waiting for this to happen? Is it a swimming pool? ‘Are we expected to swim?’ was the reply we got when we asked them for help. We want strict action against officials who should have put up barricades, so that no one loses their loved ones in such a way.”

NEW DELHI — Torrential monsoon rain over the last 24 hours has brought Mumbai, India’s second most populous city, to a grinding halt. It received 375 millimeters (almost 15 inches) of rainfall, the highest in 14 years, according to India’s Meteorological Department. Very heavy rain is expected for another day, according to the forecast, before it eases.

Twenty-four people have lost their lives, according to local media reports, including two men in a car. The government of the state of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, declared a public holiday Tuesday and requested the city’s 20 million residents stay indoors. Despite being the country’s financial hub, Mumbai’s infrastructure struggles to cope with the annual monsoon.

Water in some streets rose to waist level, and low-lying areas of the suburbs were worst-hit.

Several residents took to Twitter to share dramatic images of their flooded homes.

230,230,mumbai,2019,https://www.indiaspend.com/repeated-floods-drought-affect-maharashtra-but-they-are-not-an-election-issue-experts/,18 Oct 2019,"Repeated Floods, Drought Affect Maharashtra, But They Are ‘Not An Election Issue’: Experts","Mumbai: Farmers having to buy drinking water. City residents wading through waist-deep waters to get back home. Drought in rural districts in the same year that cities see flooding. These weather-related catastrophes have become so common in Maharashtra that citizens have nearly got inured. So inured, in fact, that analysts say mishandled floods and droughts are ""not an election issue"".

About 90 million people in the state are set to vote on October 21, 2019, and the results are scheduled for October 24.

In a year of good rainfall--Maharashtra received 32% above long-period average (the average monsoon rains received in the 50 years leading to 2010)--extreme weather-related events such as droughts and floods will not be an issue in the upcoming Maharashtra state elections, political experts say. However, problems like falling agricultural production and unemployment, that feature prominently in the elections, are aggravated by such events related to changing weather conditions.

Maharashtra has declared drought in three of the past five years. Agriculture contributes 12% of the state’s economy (gross state value added), and this is endangered by repeated drought and floods. Maharashtra reported the most number (3,030 or 39%) of farmer suicides in 2015--the last year for which the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has released such data.

Just this monsoon, Mumbai has witnessed five extreme rainfall events (rainfall above 244.5 mm in a 24-hour period). Many parts of the state saw heavy rainfall leading to flooding during the southwest monsoon, resulting in 377 deaths.

Climate experts warn that weather events such as erratic and delayed rains, floods and hail storms will continue to occur in the future. Yet, political parties and governments over the years have chosen to treat only the symptoms (giving loan waivers, transfers to farmers for buying water tankers) and not address the root cause of problems (by setting up risk assessment plans, early warning systems or climate-proof infrastructure), according to experts.

Maharashtra Elections 2009 & 2014 In 2009, the Congress and its ally the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) had won 82 (28%) and 62 (22%) seats, respectively, in the 288-member Assembly, forming the government. Hit by irrigation scams worth nearly Rs 70,000 crore, the Congress-NCP lost the elections in 2014 because they failed to provide water to Maharashtra’s drought-hit districts. In 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won 122 (42%) seats and its ally the Shiv Sena won 63 seats (22%). The Congress won 42 (15%) and the NCP won 41 (14%). Other factors that worked in the 2014 assembly elections were: the ‘Modi wave’, which propelled even during the state elections (from the 2014 general elections) with slogans such as ‘Congress Mukt Bharat’ and ‘Upar Narendra, Niche Devendra’ (referring to prime minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis), helping BJP make inroads into the state. The BJP was also able to capitalise on the dreams and ambitions of the electorate, as IndiaSpend reported in October 2014.

The twin issues of drought and flooding

The state has witnessed, as we said, extreme climate conditions--such as heavy rains, floods, drought--over the years, which has affected the livelihoods of people, taking a toll on the state’s economy.

“This critical issue is unlikely to have political traction during the elections,” Suhas Palshikar, political expert and analyst, told IndiaSpend in an interview. “The way the state's policies have shaped up over time, the state is waiting for natural disasters to turn into man-made calamities. However, this is common to all parties and the middle and upper classes, in particular, are oblivious to [the] effects of such calamities,” he said.

The 2019 southwest monsoon also saw heavy rains and floods in many parts of Maharashtra. Mumbai, Pune and western regions of Maharashtra such as Kolhapur and Sangli saw severe flooding in 2019, which are likely to have a long-term impact on the economy.

Poor drainage, rising urban population and changing land-use formats lead to higher risk of floods in cities in case of heavy rainfall events, experts had told IndiaSpend. Even rural areas faced the brunt of heavy rains and floods.

Crops over 400,000 hectares were damaged due to floods in Maharashtra during the 2019 monsoon, The Hindu reported on August 23, 2019. “Sugarcane, cotton, rice, soyabean, tur dal, groundnut are among the worst hit,” the report said.

The dairy sector has been badly hit due to floods in Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara districts, with 7,847 cattle including cows, bulls and buffaloes and 1,065 goats, sheep and 160 calves or donkeys either killed or gone missing.

In Mahabaleshwar, hail and gusty winds have destroyed 60% of the mulberry crop in April 2019. Likewise, in April and May 2018, about 6,835 hectares were affected by untimely rain and hailstorm, across the state.

“Our observations and other publications have shown that the frequency of extreme climate events has increased,” Arjuna Srinidhi, senior researcher, climate policy and head of communications at Watershed Organisation Trust (WOTR), a Pune-based NGO and research centre, told IndiaSpend. WOTR has weather stations in villages around the region that helps the India Meteorological Department with tracking weather and climate change.

There is a trend of excessive rain in short durations which has resulted in dry spells and excessive runoff, Srinidhi said. The water must be slowed down so it has enough time to seep into the ground. “Make running water walk,” he said.

“The high-intensity rainfall that we are witnessing--a part of it--is because climate change is influencing our weather patterns,” Hem Dholakia, senior research associate at Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a New Delhi-based think-tank, had told IndiaSpend. “Science has not reached that point yet (of establishing or associating a single event/incident to climate change) but what we can definitely say [is] that climate change influences the frequency and intensity of such extreme events,” he had said.

“Climate change has resulted in new problems, like shifts in the cultivation calendar, new pest attacks and longer pest infestations,” S G Salunke, regional manager, Ahmednagar, Action for Food Production (AFPRO), a non-profit organisation working with the rural poor on the management of natural resources, said.

Agriculture at the mercy of unpredictable weather

Maharashtra’s economy, as we said, is primarily agrarian, despite being one of the most industrialised states in the country. With 70% of Maharashtra’s geographical area falling under semi-arid region, the state has “prominently observed” droughts from 2011-12 onwards, according to the Maharashtra Economic Survey 2018-19. In the year 2013, the state witnessed one of the worst droughts in 40 years.

Crop production is expected to reduce, due to drought situation in the state, resulting in an estimated 8% decline in real gross state value added of the ‘crops’ sector, Maharashtra Economic Survey 2018-19 said.

Water scarcity during the kharif season (June to October) of 2018-19 in 26 districts affected 151 talukas (sub-district administrative units). Of these, 112 talukas saw severe drought while 39 saw moderate drought. About 8.6 million hectare was affected.

The area under rabi crops (sown in winter and harvested in spring) was 50% less in 2018-19 compared to the previous year mainly due to deficient rainfall in September and October 2018, according to the Maharashtra Economic Survey 2018-19. The area under cereals, pulses and oilseeds decreased by 56%, 40% and 58%, respectively, as compared to the previous year.

“Variability of rainfall has a significant effect on crop production and there will be more variable rainfall events in the future,” Salunke said. “Farmers will require training, and cannot solely rely on historical, traditional knowledge to combat new problems.” There is a need to focus on adaptation measures which will be important in the long-term, Salunke added.

Marathwada and Vidarbha are drought-prone regions in the state that fall in the rain-shadow area. These two regions accounted for nearly 70% of 611 farmer suicides in Maharashtra in the first three months of 2019, Mirror Now reported on May 10, 2019. Amravati in Vidarbha reported the most suicides (227) followed by Aurangabad (198) in Marathwada.

Between 2015-18, as many as 12,021 farmers died by suicide in the state, as per the details provided in the state legislative assembly, India Today reported on June 21, 2019. On average, these figures indicate that seven to eight farmers die of suicide every day in Maharashtra. About 43% of suicides in Maharashtra (1,293 of 3,030 suicides) were due to ‘bankruptcy or indebtedness’, NCRB data for 2015 revealed.

“The government must develop a long-term, holistic and comprehensive treatment to adapt to situations like drought,” Srinidhi said. While a focus on relief measures would also be required during drought situations, the government should consider who these relief measures are benefitting and who is missing out, he said. Often the landless, those working on leased farm lands, do not benefit from relief measures. There is also distress sale of livestock during droughts that lead to irrecoverable losses, he added.

Drought and failed crops lead to distress migration

“People have moved out from drought-hit districts to urban areas, as they do not want to practise agriculture anymore,” Nitin Birmal, state coordinator at Lokniti, and associate professor at the Dr Ambedkar Art & Commerce College, Yerwada, Pune, told IndiaSpend. “They are earning more as UBER, Ola drivers in cities. Districts like Osmanabad are empty.”

Farmers are receiving money to buy water, Birmal said. “The government is not solving the water supply problem through irrigation. Instead it is providing money to the farmers to buy their own water. Disaster management is not considered as a state issue, but a local issue which will come up only during local elections.”

Large-scale migration from Marathwada to cities such as Pune and other parts of the country have been reported due to three droughts in the last seven years and water depletion in the past five years.

Farm lands are being sold to build factories and for non-agriculture use, which in turn leads to loss of labouring jobs in the agriculture sector, IndiaSpend reported on April 17, 2019. Earlier, villagers were assured of at least two months of work during the monsoon season, now this has decreased and become irregular, Kamal Gangrude from Pimplad, a village in Nashik district of Maharashtra, had said. “The population is growing but the number of jobs is reducing each year. Last year some people got just three weeks of work in the whole season. With more machinery around too, the work is done faster.”

“As more people are marginalised, they move to urban areas (in search of employment opportunities),” Devinder Sharma, an agriculture expert told IndiaSpend. A simple dry spell becomes a drought in Maharashtra due to lack of water management. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report says dry spell to drought is going up by 1% every year, he added.

“We are following the textbooks,” Sharma said, “which say you must move people out of agriculture and into the cities for cheap labour. There are no jobs but the economists want people to move out of agriculture to become daily wage workers in the cities. Overall agriculture policy must be changed, we have deliberately kept agriculture impoverished.”

BJP promises ‘drought-free Maharashtra’, Congress-NCP promise ‘disaster-free Maharashtra’

The BJP talks of a drought-free Maharashtra in its manifesto. Further, it promises to set up a disaster management plan to deal with droughts and flooding. Its ally, the Shiv Sena, calls for a drought-free, unemployment-free and pollution-free Maharashtra, in addition to deploying trained groups in every district for disaster response.

The Congress-NCP alliance also promise a district-level action plan for climate change, in addition to strengthening the disaster-prevention mechanism.

The BJP is “not quite aware of the existing institutional structure that brings out comprehensive disaster management plan”, Kavi Kumar, professor, Madras School of Economics, told IndiaSpend. The Shiv Sena manifesto makes the right noises about effective water resource management in the state, but, like the BJP, there is very little to suggest any plan to address climate change issues in the medium- and long-run, Kumar added.

The Congress-NCP manifesto “at least acknowledges criticality of climate change problem and that seems like a big step forward,” Kumar said. “I would have liked to see some specific focus on greenhouse gas emission mitigation (say, through enhancing renewable energy share) also along with steps suggested towards improving climate resilience of Maharashtra.”

Promises such as assured income guarantee, 100% subsidy on drips and sprinklers or taps in every house will certainly help, WOTR said referring to the manifestos. Engaging the civil society in the prioritisation, planning and implementation of such long-term transformative plans will be crucial to ensure they are inclusive, they added.

The first spell of monsoon showers left traffic crawling on several routes. At least 2.5-foot of rainwater was accumulated on the S V Road in Khar, following which traffic had to be diverted to Linking Road, officials said.

Intense waterlogging also led to heavy traffic snarls in parts of Powai, Vikhroli, Mulund, Andheri-Kurla Road, stretches of the Western Express Highway, Wadala, Bhandup village road and Ghatkopar East, especially in the afternoon, Mumbai police said.

In the evening rush hour, heavy traffic congestion was also reported on Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road. Several people took to Twitter to complain about traffic snarls, with many claiming that it took them over an hour to cover just 2-8 km stretches in parts of the city.

Several BEST buses were also diverted due to waterlogging on S V Road, and near National College, Bandra Talkies, Sion, Hindmata and Gandhi Market in King’s Circle. The buses were diverted via P D Hinduja Road in Khar, parts of Sion, Hindmata flyover and Mumbai Marathi Granth Sangrahalaya Marg in Dadar east, BEST officials said.

Meanwhile, at least 30 to 40 local train services were cancelled as water accumulated on railway tracks at Kanjurmarg, Mulund, Thane and Kalyan on the Central line and a few areas at Virar and Palghar on the Western line.

While Sion, Kurla and Mulund railway stations are known to be chronic flooding spots, this was the first time that flooding was reported on the slow line at Kanjurmarg. The Central Railway’s public relations office said that a drain, choked with debris, had caused water levels to rise around 1.30 pm, which had inundated the tracks.

Chief PRO of Central Railways (CR) Sunil Udasi said that train services on both the main and suburban lines was running at least 25 to 30 minutes behind schedule. Fourteen trains on Kalyan and Kasara routes and seven on the Harbour Line were cancelled, he said.

“Thane railway station was flooded after water from the roads entered its premises. It took the staff from the Railways, BMC and TMC, around 40 minutes to pump out water in Mulund and Thane stations,” Udasi said.

With the IMD forecasting heavy rainfall over the weekend, the CR has decided to cancel the Mumbai-Pune Pragati Express, Mumbai-Pune Sinhagad Express, Bhusaval-Mumbai passenger train and Pune-Panvel passenger train on Saturday and Sunday, and the Mumbai-Bhusaval passenger train on Sunday.

The CR has also announced that the Bhusaval-Pune Express would be diverted via Daund and Manmad on both Saturday and Sunday.

The Western Railways, meanwhile, cancelled 12 local trains on Friday. A total of 105 suburban trains on the line were delayed by at least 15-20 minutes in the morning, officials said.

The Maximum City is known for its rains and traffic, among many other things. And when the two come together, it spells hell for a Mumbaikar. Anyone who has ever lived in the city is well-accustomed to the struggle of getting from one place to the other during the monsoons. There is no escaping it, regardless of your mode of transport. While you may think that this would be the optimal time to make use of the wide network of public transport in the city, be warned that this too, comes with its fair share of trouble. However, the worst area affected by the monsoons by far are the roads. Potholes, floods, falling trees and never-ending traffic jams are going to be some of the big causes of never-ending traffic jams across the city.

However, this year, the Mumbai Traffic Police hopes to make a difference and is implementing various methods to help make monsoon a trouble-free season for Mumbaikars. The cops have identified a total of 215 locations that are prone to waterlogging and claim to have already found diversions for 145 of these spots. Reports suggest that a timetable has been made, which identifies 29 days out of the four months that will witness high tide. These dates are set to be displayed on LEDs across the city, as well as shown on TV repeatedly. But these are the flooding spots that have been identified so far.

233,233,mumbai,2019,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/mumbai-rains-thane-rivers-flooding-5856451/,27 Jul 2019,Explained: Why townships in Thane district witnessed flooding today,"In the far suburbs of Mumbai city, the townships of Kalyan, Ulhasnagar, Murbad and Ambarnath received over 200 mm rain for 24 hours until this morning. Murbad, which includes rural areas, received 332 mm on average, within 24 hours, while Ulhasnagar received 296 mm and Ambarnath received 280.10 mm. Bhiwandi and Shahapur received 185 mm and 195 mm of rain, respectively.

Some of these townships are located alongside the Kalu, Ulhas, Waldhuni and Bhatsa rivers that shimmy down right through Mumbai’s outback area, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, well over ten times Mumbai’s geographical area. These rivers run through some thickly populated areas and the financial capital’s dormitories of Ulhasnagar, Titwala, Badlapur, Vithalwadi, Ambarnath, etc.

If a Mithi river in spate caused much of the havoc on July 26, 2005, when a cloudburst led to 944 mm of rain in Mumbai within a span of 24 hours, likewise, the overflowing Ulhas river is responsible for parts of Ulhasnagar being severely inundated on Friday evening and Saturday.

The Ulhas river is one of the more polluted rivers in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and is the subject of various petitions pertaining to industrial effluents in the National Green Tribunal. “There are years of neglect and pollution which has led to the water pathways being clogged, be it natural or man-made. There is nowhere the water could go and that is why it’s overflowing and reaching houses,” said river activist Janak Daftary. He added that regular cleaning of the Ulhas river doesn’t take place, thereby compounding the problem of encroachments.

According to Ulhasnagar corporator Mira Tonde, who represents the Kurla camp area, cleaning had actually taken place. “The river was cleaned but that’s not where the problems lie. The level of encroachment has made it difficult for us to reach smaller nullahs and channels. People cast their waste into the drains, directly choking them up even after we clean them. This has led to the situation today,” she said.

Are polluted rivers the only cause for these regions flooding?

Titwala, Asangaon and nearby areas also witnessed flooding due to the overflowing Modaksagar and Tansa reservoirs, which serve Mumbai’s drinking water needs. Overflow from these reservoirs again flows through rivers that run through the now thickly-populated regions.

Approximately, 13 west-flowing rivers and their 21 tributaries are important natural floodwater drainage systems for the region. Multiple dams on the west-flowing rivers are in various stages of construction or planning, including the Kalu, Shai, Gargai, Pinjal, Poshir and Barvi dams. Nearly 30,000 tribals are expected to be displaced by these.

While on the one hand, some of these rivers are encroached upon and in poor condition owing to industrial and municipal waste, the densification of these areas alongside the construction of more dams in the region to slake an ever-growing thirst of the Mumbai region makes these outback municipalities more prone to flooding.

What needs to be done to make these towns safe from flooding?

The population of the ‘Rest of MMR’, i.e, excluding Mumbai, has grown from 18 lakh in 1971 to 106 lakh in the 2011 census. This estimate errs on the side of caution — for not only is the Census data now almost eight years old but also because this does not account for more recent additions of peri-urban areas into what constitutes the MMR.

The decadal growth rate of population for the city of Mumbai between 2001 and 2011 was recorded at 4 per cent while for the rest of the MMR, it was nearly 55 per cent. There are also large industrial belts in the MMR — those across the TTC (Trans-Thane Creek) area, Taloja, Waghle Estate, Dombivali, Ambernath, Bhiwandi, etc. This multifold growth of population has not been met with commensurate growth in municipal amenities — a 2015 survey by the MMRDA found only 59 per cent of the waste water treated, none of the urban local bodies matched the service benchmarks set for collection of the waste water.

An overhaul of municipal amenities in these regions, planned in a holistic way that takes into account the likely floodwaters of the new reservoirs and dams being constructed in the region, is essential for flood-proofing this region.",flood,Mumbai Floods 2022,Mumbai Metropolitan Region,2022-07-08,2022-07-09,"['Kalyan', 'Ulhasnagar', 'Murbad', 'Ambarnath', 'Bhiwandi', 'Shahapur']","['332 mm, 296 mm, 280.10 mm, 185 mm, 195 mm']","['Damage to homes and infrastructure', 'Loss of livestock', 'Disruption of transportation', 'Loss of crops']",0,"['Thousands of people evacuated', 'Waterlogging in several parts of the city', 'Train services disrupted']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Extreme events such as storm surges are likely to occur once a year rather than once a century because of accelerated global warming, said the report approved by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The dire warnings are a call to action for governments and business leaders across the world to reduce carbon emissions that can jeopardize life on the only habitable planet known to humanity.

“The entire world needs to take responsibility and come together to fight climate change rather than debating it. India has at least taken a lead by accepting that these risks exist and has a climate change action plan in place. But it needs to be made a priority, which it is not at present,"" said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune and one of the lead authors of the report.

The report was released two days after the end of the UN Climate Action Summit in New York. The summit, focused on convincing countries to scale up their climate action ambitions, failed to get higher pledges from most member nations.

The oceans have been warming unabated since 1970, but the rise in sea levels due to warming has been 2.5 times faster since 2005 than during the 20th century, according to the report.

“If carbon emissions continue unabated, the rate at which the waterline will rise will quadruple by 2100,"" it warned, adding that a mere 50cm rise in the sea level is enough to flood major port cities around the world and expose more than 150 million people to disasters.

By 2050, many coastal megacities and small island countries may face severe extreme weather events: tropical cyclones, heavy rain, floods, extreme waves and other coastal hazards. Four Indian cities—Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Surat—are among places that could be the most severely impacted.

Mumbai, one of the world’s most populous cities and India’s financial capital, is already below the sea level at high tide and is flooded almost every monsoon season. It fails to drain regular floodwater during excess rainfall, a situation that could worsen due to the rising sea level.

The impact would also be felt on marine heatwaves and extreme El Niño and La Niña events, which are likely to become more frequent. These ocean phenomena are critically linked to the south-west monsoon that accounts for over 75% of the annual rainfall in India. El Niño’s impact on India became evident in 2015, when it faced a severe drought.

The oceans have absorbed 90% of the excess heat in the climate systems and make the planet livable. But this heat has accelerated the melt-off from glaciers, especially the ice sheets atop Greenland and Antarctica, to high levels driving the rise in sea levels.

Raising the red flag on loss of critical terrestrial and marine species to extinction, the report highlights that loss of oxygen has occurred from the surface of the sea to a depth of nearly 1,000m. Oceans have become more acidic. There has already been a shift in the distribution and abundance of fish from the equator to the poles, impacting income, livelihoods and food security of coastal cities. These changes would impact water resources and their uses, especially hydropower and irrigated agriculture in high mountain and downstream areas.

The release of the report was delayed as Saudi Arabia opposed a routine reference to the October 2018 IPCC report on the feasibility of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, countries including India committed to capping global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, while making efforts to reduce the increase to 1.5°C.

The order says the interim lines will be mapped in consultation with local residents and officials on the basis of an ‘observed flood line’ of that river. And, these lines will be valid for a year until the final flood line gets mapped.

The GR states: “The mapped blue interim flood lines will be finalised by the concerned chief engineer of the water resources department. Following this, 50-meter area from the interim blue line will be considered as no-development zone. The urban development department will independently issue regulatory orders for the same banning construction here.”

The blue lines will be valid for a year until the final flood lines get mapped.

This order comes on the heels of a high court hearing on a public interest litigation filed by NGO Vanshakti against the government. The PIL demanded the state finalise flood lines and make them sacrosanct from rampant construction and encroachments to avoid disasters. In the hearing, the government was asked to decide interim measures and policy to protect the flood plains until the final lines were notified.

“We have demanded that flood plains of all rivers in the state and Mithi (that’s a separate petition) be marked. And, these areas should be completely no go to avoid ecological devastation and disasters. We had suggested that half the width of the river on both sides be considered as the flood line and be considered as no-development zone. This 50-m mark from interim flood line is an arbitrary decision. It has probably been taken only to avoid ire of the judiciary,” said petitioner and environmentalist Stalin D of Vanshakti.

An official from the water resources department said, “We realised that demarcating the final flood lines is going to take time, so we have said wherever it is not done, do a quicker interim exercise to avoid further encroachments as asked by the court.” The water resources department has guidelines to demarcate flood lines since 1989, which were amended in 2018. The guidelines refer to drawing artificial red line and blue line in a river area. The blue line is marked considering maximum flood discharge in 25 years, while the red line is marked considering maximum floods in over 100 years. The area between the blue line and the river bank is ‘prohibitive zone’ where no development is to be allowed and area between the red line and the blue line is considered as ‘restrictive zone’ where development is restricted.

In 2018, these guidelines were amended to allow more development in restricted zone such as building of roads, laying of pipelines, drainage etc.",solution,Mumbai Floods 2022,"Mumbai, India","July 26, 2022","July 28, 2022","['Mumbai City', 'Mumbai Suburban', 'Thane', 'Palghar']","['200 mm, 250 mm, 300 mm']","['$100 million', '$200 million', '$300 million']","['10, 20, 30']","['Thousands of people were displaced from their homes.', 'Infrastructure was damaged.', 'Economic losses were incurred.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

She left home with her month-old baby, three-year-old son and five-year-old daughter on Sunday afternoon when her home started flooding. “We decided to go to Diva West, where a relative resides, but that too got waterlogged later. With nowhere to go, we decided to wait on the Diva station FoB along with so many others. It was very cold and we were worried about our children,” she said.

Navgire said she left the station around 10am on Monday, after she learnt that the water had receded. Though there was not enough milk to provide the children, she got help from local representatives, said Navgire.

Another Diva resident, Gopal Patel, 25, from Suresh Nagar, was at the station with his ageing parents. “There were more than 200 people on the FoB as it was on a height. My parents are old and I was worried about their safety. We decided to stay put at the station till the water receded and slept on newspapers.”

An officer of the Government Railway Police (GRP) said more than 500 people stayed at Diva and Mumbra platforms on Sunday night. “Most activists and officials of the Regional Disaster Management Cell (RDMC) of the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) provided food packets to them. We provided them vada pav in the morning,” he said,",adding that the water receded by 10am on Monday. flood,Thane Floods 2022,"Thane, Maharashtra, India",24 April 2022,25 April 2022,"['Thane', 'Diva', 'Mumbra', 'Kalwa', 'Kalyan', 'Dombivli', 'Ulhasnagar']","['100 mm in 24 hours', '200 mm in 48 hours']","['Damage to homes and infrastructure', 'Loss of crops', 'Disruption of transportation']",['1 death'],"['Thousands of people evacuated', 'Millions of rupees in damages']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The villages, home to some of the most popular Ganesh idolmakers, are reeling under heavy losses as business took a hit from heavy rain and flooding.

While orders for Ganesh idols have had to be cancelled and entire families are working overtime to ensure that the idols are ready by Ganesh Chaturthi on September 2, the artists rue the rains that swept away even their raw materials and almost a year’s earnings.

Pen is the hub of Ganpati idolmakers, with every shop adding an awning and selling idols as the festival of Ganesh Chaturthi draws closer. “We are the wholesale dealers of the idols. Right from selecting the Shadu mud to painting the idols, we do it here and then send the idols off. It is not a seasonal business, we do it all year round,” said Vaibhav Thakur (56), an artist specialising in making Shadu Ganpati, idols made out of clay.

As one approaches Tambadshet village, 8 km from Pen, the damage from excessive rain and flooding is hard to miss. In water-logged fields, there are white vestiges in the shape of a broken arm, or a trunk or part of the head that lay unclaimed. “Each house has a damage worth Rs 8-10 lakh at least. A big chunk of the crops have been laid to waste. We are still assessing the damage,” an official from the talathi office said. She added, “We are trying to get just compensation for people, but it will take time.”

Several idols are left unceremoniously around water bodies and roadsides, as the artisans try to make space for the new statues. The narrow roads and alleys are strewn with half-filled bags of plaster of Paris and mud, useless after coming in contact with water. “It rained incessantly for 15 days. It flooded twice, on July 26 and August 4. The region recorded over 300 mm average rainfall,” the official said.

In Johe village, 9 km away from Pen city, and less than 60 km from Mumbai, all hands are on the deck since water receded on August 7. Thirteen-year-old Sonu Rasal has taken leave from school. “Anyway, my books and uniform are all wet. So I come here in the morning,” he said, painting the hands of one of the 2-feet idol. His father Ravindra Rasal is busy answering phone calls. “I have been abused more in the past few days than ever in my life. But I understand the anger of customers and we will return their money since we are cancelling orders. We have just been dealt a really bad hand,” Rasal said. His daughter, 19-year-old Namrata, is busy doing an inventory of the idols that have been laid to waste. “The damage is equally bad on small and big idols,” she explains.

While the small idols were swept away, or chipped, the big ones — 8 or 10 feet idols — have dark spots and rotting bases. While the damage is not apparent in looks, it is evident in the brittleness of the idols. “One of our customers took the idol and it cracked while shifting. So we are now trying to identify which idols are worth salvaging and throwing away the rest,” Ajay Patil (43), an artisan who sells unpainted idols, said. All around workshops, there are coal bits burning, warming the idols up to get the damp out.

On July 26 Pen received 231 mm and on August 4 it received 290 mm rainfall. That coupled with very high tides led to massive flooding. It has rained over 2,000 mm in Pen till now, according to IMD. It has received the second highest rainfall in Raigad, first being Matheran.

Dnyaneshwar Patil (40) had a huge crater in front of his shop and his idols got swept away, but some are still marooned where he can spot them. “I didn’t bring them back, what’s the point. All of our work has gone to waste. I have a three month old daughter, my third. Suddenly I am realising that I might not be able to provide for her. I have taken up a daily wage job that pays me Rs 300 per assignment,” he said. Patil, who sold finished idols, didn’t make the sculpture, which he brought from other artisans. “People I have grown up with are turning against me and demanding money. I have approached the union,” he said.

The Johe idolmakers have an artists union. “We have several people coming to us, claiming damages. We have all suffered damages and right now, we need to help each other out,” said a union member requesting anonymity. “We are helping people fill up insurance claims and write to banks to get rebate on loans. As of now, we need financial help,” he said.

Vinod Mhatre (38) had taken a loan of Rs 7.5 lakh just last year. He has cast away at least five 10-feet idols till now into the creek. “My casts have been destroyed and they cost a lakh a piece. I can’t even make any more idols. I have lost all of my savings and now we are focusing on disposing off the idols,” he said.

Several idols, mostly of Plaster of Paris, have been already been disposed off in the creeks, still flowing higher than regular. According to environment activist Vivek Thakur, this is not an ideal situation. “Water gets polluted by the Plaster of Paris and it kills the fish, which is a prime industry here. We are trying to educate people to not dump their broken idols into creeks, but use them to fill potholes or cracks in their houses,” he said.

“I spend nine hours coloring and finishing idols. There are some in which we stuck rhinestones piece by piece. How can I break them? It is easier to leave them in water, the same respect they would have got if they were taken by customers,” Vaibhav Thakur (29) said. His store, a family business, prominently displays the villages’ condition in a banner proclaiming “Ganpati unavailable. No bookings”.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

(Express photo: Amit Chakravarty)

Union Minister for Surface Transport and BJP leader Nitin Gadkari on Friday took a swipe at the Shiv Sena led Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) saying that the civic body is sitting on a huge cash pile, but the city’s monsoon woes persist.

“The BMC has a fixed deposit of Rs 58,000 crore in bank. But every year we see Mumbai gets flooded,” he said.

The BJP leader said that some global private company should be roped in to prepare a developmental plan to tackle the problems of Mumbai. “It (the city) has huge coastal stretch which is ideal for waterways. A pollution-free water front in Mumbai can be achieved with help of a dedicated team of experts… In Venice (Italy) we often see how efficiently the water transport operates. I have a plan to bring water taxis to Mumbai. It is achievable,” he said.

The Union minister claimed the clean, pollution-free seashore of Mauritius can be replicated in Mumbai as well. He added that the water taxis could operate between Vasai-Virar and Kalyan-Thane stretch once the Navi Mumbai International Airport was completed.

Referring to better transport system in his home turf in Vidarbha region, Gadkari said, “I have decided to make five districts in the region diesel free. They will be replaced with non-conventional fuel operated taxis or e-taxis.”

Gadkari made the remarks after performing ‘bhumi pujan’ (groundbreaking ceremony) for a mangroves park in Gorai area. Gadkari’s remarks on the BMC, however, did not gone well with its ally. A senior Sena leader, requesting anonymity, said, “I am sure our party president Uddhav Thackeray will give a befitting reply to Gadkari.”

In 2019-20, the BMC spent more than Rs 100 crore on nullah cleaning as part of its pre-monsoon work, which was deemed to be satisfactory by both the ruling Shiv Sena and the administration. The civic body had also claimed to have cleaned up to 70 per cent nullahs, however, the first day of heavy showers washed away its claim.

On Friday, as LBS Road in Kurla, S V Road in Bandra, Andheri subway near Mogra nullah, Sakinaka and Hindmata saw intense flooding, citizens blamed poor planning and shoddy de-silting work for waterlogging.

Khar-resident Zoru Bhathena said flooding on S V Road in Bandra west was not new, but year-after-year the civic authorities had been unable to to fix the problem. “How many more years will it take to fix the flooding on S V Road? The government can build world-class Metros, but is unable to fix a drain? Warped priorities?” Bhathena asked.

In several areas, citizens also blamed shoddy cleaning of drains for the waterlogging. “At many places, including Kurla west, silt removed from drains was kept as it is. After rains it was washed away into the same drain. What is the point of cleaning drains and paying money to contractors if silt is not to be lifted?” Saurabh Phadke, a resident of Chuna Bhatti, said. Mumbai has drain network of 2,900-km of which a maximum of 1,600-km network is in western suburbs.

There were also reports of BMC’s pumping stations not working in full capacity. Additional Municipal Commissioner Vijay Singhal, however, denied any such problem. “All pumping stations were working,” he said.

While the civic body was slammed for poor pre-monsoon works, it earned praise for quick real time response. Soon after the rain started pounding the city, netizens flooded social media sites with photographs of flooded streets and roads, with many tagging the BMC on Twitter as well. The BMC’s response in addressing these complaints reportedly earned it much applause on Facebook and Twitter.

243,243,mumbai,2018,https://thewire.in/urban/mumbai-heavy-rains-floods-reasons,21 Jul 2018,Here's Why Mumbai Floods Year After Year,"For most of Mumbai’s inhabitants, monsoons are a new round of struggle with the city – anticipating its moods, enduring its wrath, negotiating its whims. Only someone far removed from the city’s lived reality can be unmoved by this state of affairs. Almost every time it rains, residents of Nala Sopara to the north step out of their homes into knee-deep water and wade to work. In Mankhurd, another eastern suburb, single storey transit accommodations begin to sink and families throw out pails of water to keep their homes afloat. In Mahim in central Mumbai, families carefully stack up their belongings – most valuable on top – as they watch water seeping through their walls.

Each time it pours in Mumbai and the city floods, we hear tragic stories of its many victims and inspiring stories of courage, support and mutual aid. Yet, to talk about floods year after year as a story of disaster and resilience, helps bring some consolation, but not relief. Any city that regularly demands such a price for survival and such a toll on human life, is not unprepared for calamity – it is unprepared for normality.

And the normal in Mumbai is shifting – it may be a mistake to blame every single incident of extreme rainfall on climate change, but the general trends are unmistakable. Over more than a century, average temperature in Mumbai has risen by 2.4 degrees. According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), there have been nine extremely heavy rainfall days (more than 204.5 mm) in Mumbai in twice as many years. Even the annual frequency of heavy rainfall events (64.5 – 115.5 mm) has seen a steady increase in recent decades.

There seems to be an enormous gulf between the actions demanded by the city’s perpetual crises and what its institutions and systems can possibly deliver. But the city continues to be shaped in ways that will exacerbate climate change on the one hand and inhibit ways to cope with increasingly unpredictable climate impacts on the other.

Unfortunately, the press coverage on and analysis of flooding in Mumbai customarily decry “lack of planning”, “corruption” and “non-implementation” of infrastructure projects as the main causes of the city’s recurring flooding problems. Undoubtedly, we need to act with urgency. But more urgently, we need to re-define our problems. We need to establish that flooding is an environmental, not an infrastructural crisis; to re-conceptualise the relationship between land and water; to reframe how we understand ‘infrastructure’ that can sustain overlapping urban ecosystems; and to reconsider our approach to city-making.

The science of land and water

The science of flooding requires understanding the relationship between land and water. Rainwater can either be absorbed and contained by land (call it land’s ‘absorptive capacity’) or allowed to drain into natural water bodies (call it land’s ‘drainage capacity’). The capacity of land to do either one or both of these can be enhanced or constrained by a transformation of its use and physical features. Flood plains, coastal wetlands, salt marshes, lakes, rivers, natural green cover, fields, unpaved open-spaces – all of these are lands that provide the vital service of absorbing surface water and recharging ground water. On the other hand, areas of the city that are paved-over need to be designed to drain away water that ‘runs-off’ its surface – by slope management and by a carefully integrated system of artificial and natural channels.

Land, therefore is a central component of the overall infrastructure for flood management and changing its nature significantly affects how water behaves as it falls from the sky. In other words, land provides not just living space, but also sustains vital ecosystems; it has economic value, but also provides ecological services. A systematic failure to recognise the relationship between land and water is behind much of our flooding problems.

Much of what goes in the name of ‘development’ involves eliminating land’s absorptive capacity by filling up of ponds and lakes, conversion of permeable green cover into impermeable concrete and ‘reclaiming’ wetlands and salt marshes. Crucially, land development practices have also constricted and sometimes erased natural drainage systems – and therefore rather than managing the run-off water that ‘developed’ areas produce, the city has made itself more and more vulnerable to flooding.

Infrastructure and planning?

Flooding then, is a symptom of our increasingly worsening urban-environmental crisis. However, instead of strengthening our existing environmental and urban systems – that constitute our existing socio-ecological infrastructure – we invest faith and money in mega-projects like the Brihanmumbai Storm Water Drainage project (BRIMSTOWAD), that are often ineffective and almost always unaccountable.

The BRIMSTOWAD involves creating a network of storm-water drains, concrete embankments along nallahs and pumping stations near the mouth of estuaries. This has resulted in the narrowing of the width of streams and estuaries, shifting of high-tide lines and consequent loss of the mangrove ecosystems (which act as a natural buffer during high-tides) upstream of the pumping stations. While the project’s pumping facilities do eject large quantities of water into the sea, in some cases, they have been seen to shift flooding to other areas – the case of Juhu Moragaon fishing village is a notable example.

Therefore, rather than simply blaming a supposed lack of planning and demanding project implementation, we ought to reconsider our existing planning and infrastructure practices. Mumbai’s 20 Year Development Plan proposes to open up 3,300 hectares of land that is almost entirely green cover. The coastal freeway project envisages large-scale reclamation and is – according to its own project report – likely to cause serious environmental impacts. The Metro project proposes to take over multiple wetland patches, forested areas and open spaces for its various car-sheds. In many cases, it is precisely these plans and projects and not their absence, that we ought to be worried about.

And to implement some of these projects and plans, environmental regulations like the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) that provide some protection to the city’s coastal ecology and unbuilt landscape are being gradually eroded. With every redevelopment project of older finer-grained neighbourhoods such as the BDD Chawls or MHADA layouts, where large footprint buildings will take up most of each plot of land and its natural cover, we reduce land’s absorptive potential. With every riverfront or beachfront beautification project that replaces the soft edge ecology with impervious ‘landscaped’ gardens, we constrain land’s ability to soak and drain.

Our existing planning practices are based on the mindset that the exchange value of land must determine its use, and every other value must be subordinated to this singular aim. Consequently, land is reclaimed, its edges hardened, its boundaries guarded. To service this aim, projects like the BRIMSTOWAD are devised, slave to a mindset that assumes that all rainwater is unwanted, will run-off and must therefore be drained out of the city through a built network of pumps, pipes and passages.

Our cities are being built on the logic of land economics and hydraulics, instead life systems and hydrology.

And therefore let us ask: is it possible to develop a paradigm that conceives the city as a previous landscape, with a delicate relationship between its land and water, sustaining the various life processes that depend upon it?

Ecological planning and infrastructure

An ecological paradigm would consist of at least four approaches. The first approach is ecosystems integration. This would involve a careful documentation and re-zoning of undeveloped areas and their natural ecosystems and their conceptual and physical integration as city infrastructure for flood prevention. Lands in Mumbai that were kept aside as No Development Zones (NDZs) consist of plantation areas, groves, fields, wetlands, salt marshes, ponds and streams that provide this vital service. We must look at the ecological planning of these areas and an enhancement of their capacity to function as flood prevention systems.

The second is ecological restoration, that seeks to allow ecosystems that have degraded over time to regenerate. Often it involves letting an area simply be, but sometimes artificial remediation may be needed. Many of Mumbai’s streams and rivers have lost their riparian vegetation due to edge concretisation and reclamation. Similarly, wetlands, ponds and lakes have been neglected. Wherever possible, these could be revived.

The third approach is settlement upgradation. Some of our communities most vulnerable to flooding live in self-built settlements, that continue to remain insecure and under-serviced. Neighbourhood level infrastructure and service upgradation in the form of waste management, sewage and stormwater drainage and water harvesting will help improve living conditions as well as reduce risks of flooding.

Finally, we need development controls and retrofitting of the existing formal builtscape to enable permeation. Water collection and harvesting, de-concretisation of existing water channels, replacing hard-paved areas with permeable surfaces – all of this will improve the capacity of urbanised land to absorb surface water. If carried out plot by plot and building by building, it will do much more to reduce urban flooding as compared to any drainage mega-project.

And along with all of these, we may also need to build drains, clean rivers and institute strategies for disaster management and mitigation. A secure urban future calls not just for big urban interventions, but concerted action across a range of scales and practices. Our cities can be made less flood-prone, provided we conserve and protect their fragile environmental resources, and resist the tendency to convert these into real estate. Our cities can be made more resilient, provided we understand and enrich them as socio-ecological systems and resist the tendency to think of them as a series of techno-managerial problems.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the civic body in charge of running India’s largest metropolis, has decided to install flood sensors in five rivers and two lakes in the city.

Although the date has not yet been decided, BMC’s storm water drain (SWD) department wants to install the sensors in the Dahisar, Poisar, Oshiwara, Vakola and Mithi rivers as well as the Vihar and Powai lakes in Mumbai.

According to the SWD, the flow level transmitters will remotely send the authorities an early warning indicating their location on days the level of water starts rising, especially after heavy rain. The devices will have a sensor, a transmitting system using SIM cards and GPS (global positioning system). They will work on solar power.

Media reports quoted BMC officials as saying that the devices would help the authorities to immediately evacuate people living near rivers and lakes as soon as water levels start to rise.

During the floods of 26 July, 2005, Mumbai’s water bodies, especially the Mithi River, overflowed after unusually heavy rain and due to an antiquated drainage system, the water was unable to flow out to sea. Approximately 1,094 people died in the floods.

Gregory David Roberts, the author of the bestselling novel Shantaram, is believed to have once remarked that “more dreams are realised and extinguished in Bombay than in any other place in India”. Mumbai, the city of dreams, desires, glamour, and fame has for decades attracted all of India to dwell in it and to revel in the life of struggle and toil it has to offer. The story of Mumbai began when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed on the Southwestern coast of India in the late fifteenth century. Within a decade the Portuguese gained a stronghold over Bombay which was then seven separate islets.

What the Portuguese began, the British took forward in the seventeenth century. Under them, the city took a new birth, transformed itself and shone like a gem attracting merchants, traders, bankers from all over the world. In the next couple of centuries, the British went on to alter the city’s architectural space, building tall gothic structures, reclaiming lands submerged under the sea and constructing roadways, bunds and drainage systems. In the process of building and rebuilding the city under the colonial regimes, Bombay in itself was becoming a colonising force. Trapped under the brutal maneuvers of colonialism it began oppressing those it attracted through crowded streets and shanties, deplorable living and working conditions and regular outbreaks of disease.

“The Portuguese are long gone now, the British have packed their bags and left, and yet the experience of the city as a colonising force persists,” writes historian Gyan Prakash in his celebrated book, ‘Mumbai Fables’. What was once colonial greed has now turned into the avarice of an independent, industrialising India, eager to find itself space within the ranks of the world economic powers. Perhaps the best testimony to Mumbai’s struggle with modern-day greed is the way nature expresses its wrath over the city, year after year in the form of large-scale destructive floods. Writing about the floods that stalled the city in 2005, journalist Naresh Fernandes in his book ‘City adrift: A short biography of Bombay’ remarked: “The 26 July rains had made apparent decades of wilful damage wrought on Bombay. Politicians and bureaucrats, in their eagerness to benefit builders, had disregarded all notions of sustainable development.” The question then arises as to what went wrong in the decades spent building Mumbai that the city is still posited against nature in an unwilled fight at least once every year.

Bombay: The city of colonial greed

“One factor that causes flooding is the impediment to groundwater recharge, which is the process of water permeating into the soil due to the land area’s porosity. The more land that one starts paving, the higher the chances are of rainwater accumulating on the surface, causing waterlogging. This is called a run-off,” says Saptarshi Sanyal, Assistant Professor at School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi[SS1] . He adds that the concept of a runoff is particularly useful in understanding why Mumbai is prone to floods because large parts of the city is built over on reclaimed lands, that is land created artificially from underneath the ocean.

The process of reclaiming land from the ocean can be traced back to the very roots on which Bombay was built. Gyan Prakash in his book writes that the idea of reclaiming lands submerged under the sea was mooted by the Portuguese. But it was the East India Company that took it up in all earnestness as they found themselves with a group of scattered islands with land space less than 20 square miles. The first such reclamation project was completed in 1784. “By 1838 these reclamations, the filling of breaches and the construction of bunds and roadways, had joined the seven islets into a single island,” writes Prakash. In essence, Bombay was built on land stolen from the sea. The Europeans were quick to realise the economic benefits that could be churned out of reclamation projects and soon after, hills were flattened out and the rubble was thrown into the marsh for the sake of reclaiming more and more land. “We have created a city out of the water,” said historian Mariam Dossal in an interview with the Guardian.

While the city took birth upon the selfish interests of colonial authorities, the subsequent development of Bombay as a colonised city, also shows how the imperial powers moulded it as per their needs. “Such cities embody the most highly developed features of colonial rule; they are essentially parables of power which are translated in different cities into explicit forms of aggregation and control,” writes Dossal in her article ‘Limits of colonial urban planning: a study of mid-nineteenth century Bombay.’

While there were significant efforts made on the part of British colonial authorities to build an infrastructure in Bombay that the Europeans could boast of as their own creation, imperial interests would always take center stage. For instance, in the second half of the nineteenth century, the building of comprehensive drainage systems, large land reclamation projects, transport systems and wet docks were priorities of the British builders. However, the 1857 revolt meant that funding for the development projects was quick to be diverted into military needs and Bombay’s development took a back seat. Further, Dossal writes in her article that European planners were rather dismissive of Indian builders, making it all the more difficult for public works to be completed on time.

Mumbai: The city of modern India’s greed

When a free India took birth in 1947, its first steps was accompanied by large-scale urbanisation. The rapid urban development, however, was restricted to only certain cities, to which men and women from all over the country migrated in search of economic opportunities. Bombay, of course, was one of the most important urban centers in this regard. It was not only receiving migrants from all over the country, but also from among those who had lost their homes in the bloodshed of Partition.

Independent India’s ‘city of dreams’ had to be created most efficiently, and most importantly with technical expertise. “In the dream world of planners, Bombay appeared primarily as a configuration of industries, buildings, houses and streets, a system of production, communication, and circulation,” writes Prakash. Yet again, when the planning of Bombay was being re-examined in the 1960s, the guiding principle of the Bombay Municipal Corporation (BMC) was to improve the city as an industrial space.

“In Mumbai, the towers are built in very high density, you can literally look into people’s homes. In such a situation there is no space for the water to go when it accumulates,” says Sanyal. (Express Photo by Vasant Prabhu.) “In Mumbai, the towers are built in very high density, you can literally look into people’s homes. In such a situation there is no space for the water to go when it accumulates,” says Sanyal. (Express Photo by Vasant Prabhu.)

“Organising such a space required the strict control of land use because the land was the basic commodity in which the town planner deals,” writes, Prakash. Consequently, the urban planning of independent India’s Bombay went back to the same approach that was first postulated by the colonial rulers- that of reclaiming land from the sea. A study conducted by Mumbai Transformation Support Unit (MTSU) in 2012 showed that Mumbai has seen thrice as many reclamations in the years after Independence as it did under 250 years of colonial rule. Moreover, the reports showed that large-scale reclamations were carried out both officially by government agencies, and illegally by several others. “The reclamation that was carried out originally only to link the seven islands of Mumbai was eventually performed to a greater extent to accommodate the ever-burgeoning population of the city,” says a report published by Professor P.T. Kadave, A D Kale and Shubham Narwade. They added that “some of this development has extended further to encroach upon the city’s existing stormwater drains, in

order to meet the housing demand of the city’s growing population.”

The large number of reclamation projects in the city was accompanied by haphazard industrial and urban constructions on the land. “In Mumbai, the towers are built in very high density, you can literally look into people’s homes. In such a situation there is no space for the water to go when it accumulates,” says Sanyal. He goes on to explain that “a lot of new developments often overlook the natural lay of the land in terms of the drainage”. “In such a situation first of all the water will get blocked somewhere or the other, and secondly, the water cannot even seep into the ground because concreting and roadways are largely impervious,” he explains.

One example of such haphazard development in Mumbai is the construction of the Bandra-Worli sea link in 2010. “It has constricted the mouth of Mithi River at the Mahim bay. So, when the water from the river is discharged into the bay, during the high tides, due to its mouth being constructed the water surges back and overflows from the bank resulting in devastating floods,” write Kadave, Kale, and Narwade.

Stealing land from the sea, too much urban development in too little time, and lack of thought towards natural drainage patterns are, however, just part of the problem that the ‘city of dreams’ suffers from. The larger question remains if the ‘dreams’ themselves have caused the problem. “There is a social angle to this as well, in terms of what people are aspiring. Now we have a situation wherein, on one hand, there is an economic group that do not have places to live, and then there is another group who invest in houses in which they don’t even live,” says Sanyal adding that “we need to reflect upon whether our demands are tenable and sustainable or not”.

Today Mumbai experiences and re-experiences its worst nightmare every year between the months of June and August. People get stranded for hours, roadways and railways are brought to an indefinite halt and yet the city’s inexplicable charm remains unfazed. Every year millions make their way to this city, during rain or not, hoping to link their fates with the city’s own meteoric rise. However, as Fernandes rightly puts across in his book, and we need to remind ourselves over and again: “A city can flourish only if it has common ground to make common cause”.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

EVEN though it stopped raining on Wednesday, it was only on Friday morning that Rajesh Makariya could enter his industrial unit at Navghar in Vasai East. Along with his employees, he spent the entire day draining out the remaining floodwater, muck and dead insects from his nut-bolt manufacturing unit on the ground floor of the estate. Taking stock of the damage to his unit, Makariya said, “Including raw material and machinery, I have suffered a loss of at least Rs 25 lakh. This is excluding the production cost.” It will take Makariya at least 15 days to procure new machinery and get his unit restarted, putting him a fortnight behind schedule for his order.

Plastic contamination is now universal. A study by Orb Media said that plastic fibres, produced by plastic waste breaking down, were found in a majority of tap water samples tested from across the world, including India. A recent study by the same organisation found plastic fibres in bottled water, including some popular brands. While the health impact of the fibres or micro pieces on human health is not known, plastic residues have found in fish, sea birds and marine mammals.

A flood prone city like Mumbai has another reason to welcome the ban on plastic bags. In July 2005, when record rains and floods killed over a thousand people in the city, environmentalists and urban planners said plastic bags that choked drains were one of the reasons for the disaster. Maharasthra decided to ban the sale and use of plastic bags and the then chief minister Vilasrao Deskmukh told the state assembly that the plastic bags were choking Mumbai’s drainage and sewage systems. The state banned plastic bags, but the ban was never strictly implemented.

So, will the ban on plastic bags make Mumbai less flood prone this monsoon? Experts are not sure. Vinod Kumar Sharma, senior professor in disaster management at Indian Institute of Public Administration and vice chairman of the Disaster Management Authority of Sikkim, said that Maharashtra’s decision to ban plastic bags has come late.

“There were many reasons for the floods in 2005; the nearly 100 cm of rain (in a day) was unprecedented, but unplanned urban development, diversion of the Mithi river (the main drainage channel for suburbs like Kurla, Santacruz, Andheri) were also responsible,” said Sharma. “All drains were choked and plastic waste was one of the causes; there was no option but to ban plastic.”

Sharma said that Sikkim banned plastic bags 22 years ago and the benefits of the decision are just becoming visible. “When I go to Gangtok (Sikkim’s capital), I have seen that during any cloud burst the drain system is working perfectly,” said Sharma. He said that with changes in climate, extreme weather events are likely to be more frequent. “We will adapt to the change (the ban). The impact of the plastic ban will not be seen immediately but it will become apparent very soon.”

But experts said that it was worrying that there is no mention about the multi-layer material used to pack crisps, tea and other foods. This packaging material, which comprises of a metal film sandwiched between recyclable plastic, is unwanted by recyclers. Almitra Patel, member, Supreme Court Committee for Solid Waste Management, had told this newspaper that this material which is not recyclable, poses a bigger threat to the environment and water drainage.

The Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 n Rule 9 (3) says that manufacture and use of non-recyclable multilayered plastic shall be phased out by March 2018, but a ban seems nowhere in sight.

“This kind of packaging is a problem, even in Sikkim,” said Sharma. “The centre has to take a decision on this. States cannot say that we will now allow this kind of packaging.”

With every major spell of flooding – on June 20, June 28 and July 6 – residents have inundated social media platforms with photographs of streets and homes under several feet of muddy water. Roads riddled with potholes and cracks, many of them built only in the last five years, have added to the chaos. Landslides along highways, where extension work is under way, have caused traffic gridlocks. The images are not just of the town areas – where some flooding is an annual monsoon feature – but also of semi-urban and new suburban areas where frenetic real estate development and highway and road projects have tarred over large swathes of wetlands and fields.

Residents say the construction frenzy, both by the government and private sector, in the last half-decade is to blame for the state’s descent into urban flooding. Many declare Goa has joined the ranks of other Indian cities plagued by urban flooding such as Mumbai and Chennai.

“Full on development in Goa. So Goa is drowning like Mumbai,” Viresh Borkar posted on Facebook on July 6.

Comparing Goa to flood-prone Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai in an article in The Navhind Times in June, Goa University professor and researcher Dr Nandkumar Kamat wrote, “The transformation of the local landscape is beyond recognition and beyond belief.”

Commentators say road reconstruction and widening, and big infrastructure is the principal focus of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in the state. In addition, the state is reported to have received Rs 25,000 crore in Central funds for highway and bridge projects.

A comparatively small resident population of around 1.5 million gives Goa a civic managerial edge over most states in India. But this past month has driven home the high cost of runaway development and concretisation of a state once touted as an idyllic monsoon getaway for the rest of urban India.

‘Tragedy of urbanisation’

“To anyone born and brought up in Goa, the signs of frequent urban floods are clearly visible,” Kamat wrote in the article, adding that roads turn into “temporary rivers” every time it rains heavily. He blamed this “tragedy of urbanisation” on the “complete failure of urban planning”. He said road construction in the low-lying and densely populated Salcete taluka, for instance, has been done without understanding the hydrography of the Zuari and Sal rivers and how these rivers help in the discharge of surface runoff water during monsoon.

Architect Sunil Sardessai told Scroll.in that Goa once had better roads than the rest of India, but the ones that have come up in recent years are a “road engineering disaster”.

A case in point: the road along the upscale Panjim-Miramar seafront area, which the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation took two years to build at a cost of Rs 72 crore, flooded last week as a result of inadequate cross drainage, leading to a barrage of criticism on social media. Several such big-ticket road projects undertaken by state and Central agencies have gone under water, drawing flak. On July 6, the Opposition Congress demanded a vigilance enquiry into road construction in Panjim and for accountability to be fixed.

Complaints about the condition of roads both from the public and the Opposition prompted Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar to call an emergency meeting of Public Works Department officials last week. But there is also trouble within the cabinet with Arts and Culture Minister Govind Gaude alleging corruption in road works and calling for Public Works Department Minister Sudin Dhavalikar’s resignation.

Covered in concrete

The capital Panjim is among the worst affected by the floods. “For the first time in all my life, I saw Miramar waterlogged so badly,” businesswoman Nenette Vaz Fernandes said of the popular beach area. “The waters were knee deep and entering people’s houses.”

Architect Tallulah D’Silva, who runs the Mission Green Goa blog, said this was because high-rise office and residential complexes have come up over swamps, marshlands and fields, greatly reducing the city’s ability to drain off excess water. “Earlier, the water that drained into Panjim’s inner city St Inez creek was clean. Now, it is black from the sewage of buildings,” she said.

Kamat pointed out, “It is a global norm in sustainable urban planning to leave existing, traditional urban wetlands, private or public, lakes, ponds, tanks or reservoirs or swampy areas untouched, un-reclaimed as these act as natural ecological buffers against flooding.” But in Panjim, he said, most open spaces and setback areas (which separate buildings from roads, rivers or the shore) have been covered in concrete or bitumen.

The rest of Goa, too, has seen a proliferation of reinforced concrete pavements and drains, car parks, jogging tracks, and elaborately tiled footpaths. This has not only led to an increase in impervious covered surface area but is also alleged to be a source of corruption. “As architects, we know the real costs of these projects. But government corporations tender them out at five times the cost,” said an architect, who did not wish to be identified. “There is no accountability and complete anarchy.”

Tallulah D’Silva said that as more apartment complexes with paved surfaces come up, exposed soil area that allows for water absorption and harvesting has come down. This has resulted in an increase in surface runoff and flooding.

Calling for “a ban on new paved surfaces”, architect Dean D’Cruz said, “There should be a rule that at least 25% of every plot should be retained with exposed soil to facilitate water absorption.”

Not just cities, villages and semi-urban areas are also under water this monsoon – a fallout of rampant construction. (Credit: Benedict de Souza)

Farmland, forests depleting

It is the same story in villages and semi-urban areas. Experts say fields and other green cover – natural catchment areas for rain water to enter the soil and replenish the groundwater table – are rapidly declining as real estate values go north and farmland is converted for industrial, institutional and settlement purposes.

Based on research conducted by Solano Da Silva, lecturer and researcher at BITs Pilani’s Goa campus, for the 1986-2017 period, planning bodies diverted approximately 57,318 hectares of agricultural land and 10,548 hectares of forests for settlement, commercial and industrial uses. This included the diversion of some 11,300 hectares for mining.

A news report published in May said the state government had itself acquired 45 lakh square metres of farmland and orchards since 2013 for tourism, industrial estate, roads and other infrastructure projects. Defending the land conversion, Town and Country Planning Minister Vijai Sardesai was quoted as saying, “Government projects are in public interest and for that, we have to go for conversion of land wherever required.”

But experts say this real estate penetration has damaged storm water drains that channel monsoon runoff into creeks and estuaries, which in turn carry it to the Arabian Sea. “Nullahs are being concreted over, or the edges are concreted and the nullahs are being reduced in width, and so unable to take large volumes of monsoon runoff, after a cloudburst,” said Tallulah D’Silva.

In addition, large-scale tree felling to make way for infrastructure has increased soil erosion while the real estate industry’s focus on building holiday homes and apartments has led to municipal and panchayat bodies giving questionable clearance to condominiums on slopes and plateaus, she said.

253,253,mumbai,2018,https://frontline.thehindu.com/environment/article25555078.ece,21 Nov 2018,Reclaiming the Mithi,"THE Mithi river came into public consciousness after the catastrophic floods of July 26, 2005, in Mumbai. Although caused by a supercell storm—a towering cloud of rain and high-speed winds that dropped rain over the city—the effect of the floods was exacerbated by the unplanned development of the city and the systematic destruction of natural flood control systems.

For many Mumbaikars, the floods were an education in more ways than one. Few knew that the stretch of stinking water that caused them to hold their breath as local trains crossed over it every day was not a drain but a river called Mithi. After 2005, the Mithi became a household name and its rejuvenation something of a mission, though not for long. In the immediate aftermath of the deluge, plans were made to revitalise its natural safety features.

The Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA), which is the regional planning agency with special powers to execute infrastructure work in the city, came under scrutiny after the Mumbai floods. The MMRDA attempted to redeem itself by commissioning at least four major studies on the Mithi. But in 2015, 10 years after the floods, State Environment Minister Ramdas Kadam said that the Mithi was a river only in name. In reply to queries raised by legislators during the monsoon session of the Maharashtra State Assembly, Kadam quoted a Maharashtra Pollution Control Board report and said: “The analytical report clearly suggests that the river is getting 93 per cent waste water from Mumbai homes and 7 per cent chemical sewage from industrial units nearby.”

A recent report of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) that analysed the health of the country’s rivers said that there were 351 polluted stretches in rivers all over India and 45 critically polluted stretches. The worst offending States were Maharashtra, Assam and Gujarat. According to the CPCB, the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) in the Mithi is 50 mg/litre. The BOD is a measure of the extent of organic pollution in the water. A BOD of more than 6 mg/litre indicates pollution. Earlier this year, yet another plan was launched to clean the Mithi. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and his wife even featured in a promotional video about cleaning rivers, but there is not much to show for it. In response to its parent body’s report, the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board said the State’s action plan would be executed with a focus on untreated sewage, industrial effluents and plastics. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has also budgeted for a new sewage treatment plant along the Mithi.

The Mithi originates in Mumbai’s Sanjay Gandhi National Park and flows for 17.84 km before it drains into the Arabian Sea. The State government says that there are 40 polluted stretches along the Mithi. In its upper reaches, within the national park, the river is clean. It is only when it leaves Powai lake that it suffers the pollutants of the city. At one time, it passed through thick mangrove forests, but only a few of these remain and even these are strewn with plastic bags and choked at the roots with black sludge.

A Concerned Citizens Commission convened by the Conservation Action Trust brought out a report titled “Mumbai Marooned: An Enquiry into Mumbai Floods 2005”. The report “estimated that Mumbai has lost about 40 per cent of its mangroves between 1995 and 2005, some to builders and some to encroachment (slums). Sewage and garbage dumps have also destroyed mangroves.”

Instead of its once-idyllic path, the Mithi now flows through middle-class residential colonies, the Bandra-Kurla Complex which houses leading businesses, a posh residential enclave and the slum colonies at Dharavi, Morarji Nagar, Kurla, Sakinaka and Jai Bhim Nagar. The banks of the Mithi are walled in for long stretches, possibly leading to the impression that it is a nullah. Since the slums are illegal, they have never been provided municipal facilities, and the river has proved to be a one-stop solution for everything.

The unorganised sector flourishes in this area. Earlier, tanneries and bootleggers were a large part of it, but after the floods their presence has decreased. Barrel washing (there are special barrel cleaners who clean out drums of sludge oil, chemicals and other industrial products), scrap dealers and even large-scale fuel and edible oil adulteration units are some of the businesses carried out here. Tyres, toxic chemicals, thermocole, glass, and solid and liquid wastes that have no recycling value find their way directly into the river. At shallow points in the river, there are islands of junk.

Although a small river, the Mithi plays a crucial role in the health of the city. It existed when Mumbai was a series of seven unconnected islands. The Mithi’s catchment area of 7,295 hectares seems completely out of proportion to its size and actually emphasises its vital role in the region. Its tidal reach, or the extent to which high tides affect the river, is about 7 km. Left to itself, nature had worked out an excellent balance. Mangroves grew all along the tidal reach. At low tide, exposed mudflats were part of the balance. But rampant reclamation started in the 19th century.

A study titled “Making the sewer a river again: Why Mumbai must reclaim its Mithi” by Gautam Kirtane of the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) says: “Alarmingly, about two-thirds of the streams and drainage channels in the Mithi’s catchment have also fallen prey to land reclamation and urbanisation in the same period of time (J. Kamini, 2006: Spatio-temporal analysis of land use in urban Mumbai using multi-sensor satellite data and GIS techniques). This is a worrying development as ponds play a vital role in the context of flood protection in their micro-catchments besides providing an opportunity for recreation, fishing, and siltation. The decrease in ponds and tanks is directly proportional to the increase in built-up area around the Mithi; the impervious urban surface increased from 46 per cent in 1966 to 85 per cent in 2005. This increase has drastically reduced the percolation of rainwater, thereby accelerating the run-off.”

The report also states: “The area under mudflats in the Mahim Creek has decreased from 4.47 km in 1966 to 3 km in 1987 and finally to 1.5 km in 2005. Nearly 75 per cent of the area under mudflats has been reclaimed and transformed (J. Kamini, 2006).”

One building project that severely affected the Mithi was the Mumbai airport. The estuarine area, ponds and mudflats were gobbled up for the development of the airport. A Google Earth image of 2005 reveals that the river was forced off its course. The ORF report says: “Between 1976 and 2004, airport works forced the river to deviate unnaturally, making it bend at 90 degree angles four times in rapid succession thus, rearranging its erstwhile linear flow. The river was made to pass through a channelised culvert beneath the runway, and bound with walls and embankments on both sides…the river was first bifurcated and then reunited forming a small island…. This area was subsequently reclaimed by the Airports Authority of India and was used for the extension of the runway in the late 1980s. There is no doubt that the airport expansion has adversely affected the course of the Mithi River, leading to its rapid environmental degradation and reducing its ability to effectively drain this densely populated low-lying region.”

The Bandra-Kurla Complex is another example of disregard for the role of the river and ecological spaces. The Concerned Citizens Commission report says: “With regard to Mumbai’s natural rivers, including the Mithi, the MMRDA has shown shocking ignorance, apathy and neglect. Nothing exemplifies this as much as the fact that the Mithi river and the inter-tidal region in the estuary is not shown in MMRDA land use plan for 1996-2011.”

The MMRDA and the BMC were made responsible for desilting and revitalising the river, but instead there has been institutionalised abuse of the river. Consider this example. The natural banks of the Mithi have been replaced with concrete walls ostensibly for reasons of safety like flood control. And the mangroves and mudflats, which are the best possible flood control mechanisms, have been shut off by these retaining walls. Cutting off mangroves from the daily wash of tides is a sure-fire way of killing them. Clearly, the walls are just a precursor to further reclamation.

Long before the 2005 deluge, various studies had warned the administration of disasters waiting to happen if the city’s infrastructure and development were not taken in hand. Both the BMC and the MMRDA had themselves appointed committees and consultants for this. The following six were all specific to the Mithi: The Natu Committee Report, 1975; Report on Model Studies on the effect of proposed Reclamation in Mahim Creek (Bandra-Kurla Complex) by the Central Water and Power Research Station, 1978; Dharavi Storm Water Drainage System: Detailed Project Report by Shah Technical Consultants, 1988; Paranjape Committee for development of a gated barrage across the mouth of the Mithi River in 1988; Brihanmumbai Storm Water Drainage Project (BRIMSTOWAD) Report, 1993; and “The Mithi River: Water Pollution and Recommendations for its Control” by Klean Environment Consultants, 2004.

The Concerned Citizens Commission report says: “The restoration of the flow of the Mithi river is essential if the tragedy of 26/7 [2005] is not to be repeated.” But despite the horrifying statistics of that time—914 human deaths, 20,000 animal deaths and an estimated Rs.450 crore in losses caused by 944 mm of rain in 24 hours—there has been little change. The Mithi and its ecosystem are as neglected, exploited and handicapped as ever.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

India’s economic capital and largest city is in the news again and for predictable reasons. The city has received 438 per cent excess rain in a single day, which has thrown normal life out of gear and caused 4 deaths so far.

On Sunday, June 24, Mumbai city received 151.2 mm of rainfall as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The normal rainfall for June 24 in Mumbai is 28.1 mm. That means the city received 438 per cent excess rainfall on that day. A 15-year-old boy died after he fell into a manhole near Evershine Nagar in Malad (West). Two men were killed after a tree collapsed near Fashion Street in South Mumbai on Sunday evening, according to authorities. A 13-year-old boy was killed and his parents were injured in a wall collapse on their house at Wadol village in Thane.

But the bad news does not stop there. Between June 1 and June 24, the normal rainfall recorded for Mumbai city is 396.7 mm. The amount of rainfall that the city got on June 24, 151.2 mm is more than one-third of that number.

The city’s suburbs are also receiving excess rainfall. On June 24, suburban Mumbai received 31.7 mm rainfall as per the IMD, which is 18 per cent in excess of what it usually receives.

The only sore spot is Thane, which, while being flooded, received 16.5 mm as opposed to 22.6 mm, a deficit of 27 per cent.

On Monday morning, Mumbai’s local trains were running between 15-30 minutes late on account of water logging on the railway tracks, inconveniencing office-goers. Road traffic was also hit due to water logging in parts of the Eastern and Western Express Highways.

On July 26, 2005, Mumbai had recorded the eighth heaviest-ever recorded 24-hour rainfall figure of 944 mm, which intermittently continued for the next day. More than a 1,000 people had died in these floods.

The lush, coastal state of Kerala in the southernmost part of India is no stranger to heavy rainfall. The monsoon season brings an average of 2,700 mm of rain to the state¹, which is more than what the Philippines gets annually². This year’s monsoon season, however, wasn’t average.

The monsoons soaked Kerala with above average rainfall for two months, and then delivered an immense spike. In the first 19 days of August, 758 mm of rain poured over Kerala — 164% above normal³. In a few days, more rain fell over this state the size of Switzerland than what falls over the US in a year⁴.

Intense monsoon rainfall over Kerala, August 2018

Kerala was inundated. There were widespread floods and thousands of landslides. The disaster killed over 480 people and affected nearly 5.4 million. A massive response operation was mobilized by the government, civil society, private sector, and local fishermen. Over 260,000 were evacuated and more than 1.4 million were provided shelter in 3,200+ relief camps.

At the request of the Government of India — the Government of Kerala, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank conducted a Joint Rapid Disaster Needs Assessment to quantify the damage and assess the long-term recovery needs. Considering the impact on housing, infrastructure, utilities, livelihoods, health, environment, and cultural heritage — the estimated recovery cost is about US$ 3.5 billion⁵, just for the priority sectors.

This scale of damage from floods is not an outlier for India. The average annual loss from floods in the country is estimated to be US$ 7.4 billion⁶.

Disasters causing damages of over a billion US dollars, 1993–2018

In recent years, extreme rainfall has also caused flash floods in India’s major cities — including in Mumbai (2005), Srinagar (2014), and Chennai (2015). The impact of climate change and rapid, unregulated urban growth has further exacerbated the risk of floods for India’s urban centers⁷.

Building long-term resilience

Ten years before the Kerala deluge, on August 18, 2008 the Kosi river broke its embankment and flooded the populous state of Bihar — where one in three people are still in poverty. 493 people died and three million families in the state were affected, many losing their homes and all their assets.

At the government’s request, the World Bank and GFDRR conducted a flood needs assessment and initiated the Bihar Kosi Flood Recovery Project in 2010. This 8-year project helped rebuild houses and critical infrastructure, and also supported the restoration of livelihoods of the affected people.

To build long-term resilience, this was followed by the ongoing Bihar Kosi Basin Development Project. This project is enhancing the Bihar Water Resources Department’s capacity to manage flood risk. It is also helping farmers in the region to enhance agriculture productivity and improve the market access of their crops.

World Bank’s ongoing flood resilience activities, September 2018

Subsequently, when the Himalayan states of Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir were hit by devastating floods in 2013 and 2014 respectively — rapid post-disaster needs assessments guided the set up of the Uttarakhand Disaster Recovery Project and the Jhelum and Tawi Flood Recovery Project.

These projects are helping the state disaster management authorities to (a) ‘build back better’ and (b) to develop long-term resilience, response, and governance capacities. In addition to these flood resilience projects, GFDRR has also supported cooperation between India’s Central Water Commission and the Japan Water Agency in improving dam safety guidelines for India⁸.

Supporting Kerala’s flood recovery

For Kerala, the World Bank is looking to extend support to the Government of Kerala’s comprehensive flood recovery efforts and to build greater resilience to future shocks⁹. The support is subject to Government of India’s formal request and approval by the World Bank Board of Governors.

“The framework we have prepared in consultation with the Government of Kerala will help the state with early recovery needs restoring the infrastructure and livelihoods. A very important part of our engagement will be to support the work of state institutions and build on the state-community relationships that exist in Kerala.” - Junaid Ahmad, World Bank Country Director in India

The proposed recovery and resilience framework will follow a phased approach. First phase will attempt to address early recovery needs and setting the stage for a resilient recovery. To build resilience to future shocks, the second phase would focus on policy and institution strengthening in the state, taking a long-term view to reduce flood risk in India.

To help Kerala manage financial impacts of future disasters, the framework also defines innovative financial solutions, such as diaspora bonds and insurance, and includes measures to mainstream resilience into sectoral investments.

The National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) in Mumbai has compiled a preliminary report on the Vasai Virar floods this monsoon, suggesting short-term and long-term measures to avoid similar inundation of urban areas in the region in future. The report pegs the cost of the entire exercise for mitigation measures at Rs 12 crore.

In the month of July, the cities of Vasai, Virar and Nallasopara had faced floods after incessant rains and blocked rainwater drains. The Vasai-Virar City Municipal Corporation (VVCMC) had roped in the IIT and NEERI to understand what caused the floods and what measures should be introduced to avoid a similar situation. The municipal authorities had also conducted several public hearings, a report on which is still to be compiled. “We had taken insights from residents.

What explains the anomaly?

Extreme rainfall events all over the country are masking significant rainfall deficit.

For instance, Mumbai recorded a deficit of 9 per cent between June 28 and July 4, according to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). Despite the deficit, the city had a 39 per cent excess rainfall for the period starting from June 1 to July 4. At the end of July 10, the percentage of excess rainfall climbed to 64 per cent. It means, within a span of six days (June 5-10), Mumbai received 25 per cent more rain than what the city receives during this 40-day period (June 1-July 10).

The rainfall in just the past week (412.2 mm) increased the excess cumulative rainfall by 25 per cent. On July 10 alone, the city received 165.8 mm of rainfall, 831 per cent above normal.

The flood-like situation in Mumbai is due to extreme rainfall and is seen in many regions in India. For example on June 12, Mizoram received 107.7 mm of rainfall, which is 643 per cent more than the normal rainfall for that day. Manipur, on the other hand, received 32.9 mm rainfall, which is 68 per cent more than the normal. This was when the monsoon had not even been officially declared in the region. Ten people died in both states due to floods caused mainly by landslides and bridge collapses.

Although floods are a regular in India, there has been a worrying trend in the past few years.

Last year, they not only did they come early, but stayed longer. In July-August 2016, when Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan were in a drought-like situation, they were hit by floods. During the same time, Bihar and Assam, which faced their worst floods in almost three decades, had seen deficit rainfall that monsoon.

Extreme weather events and climate change

Widespread extreme rain events over central India have increased three-fold between 1950 and 2015, according to a study published in Nature Communications in October 2017. It notes a 10-30 per cent increase in rainfall events over the region where more than 150 mm of rain in a day has been occurring despite a general weakening of monsoon circulation.

Another study conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar predicted an increase in extreme rainfall events in Southern and Central India and had linked it to global warming due to climate change.

Thousands of residents of the areas found themselves cut off from Mumbai where most of them travel to work via the suburban rail network. The tracks were under water throwing the suburban rail services out of order.

Planners say little importance is given to environmental factors while preparing plans for development of the city. Sulakshana Mahajan, senior urban planner, said that “rampant development” is one of the key factors for such flooding. “The drainage channels that take water from higher level to the sea level get blocked due to excessive construction and civic authorities do not clear them,” she said. She pointed out, “Generally in development plan, such channels are not marked, or even topography is not considered, which becomes a major issue in all cases; not just Vasai-Virar area.”

Hitendra Thakur, MLA from Vasai and chief of Bahujan Vikas Aghadi that runs the Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation, said that development alone should not be held responsible for the flooding. He argued that geographical factors, high tide too played a role for the scale of waterlogging on Tuesday. Jaidev Hemmady (37), a writer, who has been living in Virar since 1990s, said there is wide scale construction in Virar west. “As there were many open plots, many residential and commercial projects have come up in Virar west. Mostly, parts of Virar west were flooded on Tuesday,” he said.

Pankaj Joshi, executive director of Mumbai-based Urban Design Research Institute (UDRI) too echoed Mahajan’s view and said that planning is not done keeping the topography and environmental positions in mind. “Other than Mumbai, very little heed is paid to environmental position —which is a low-lying area, which is flood-prone area, which is the watershed, etc.” Thakur said the topography of the area is such that rain water flows from east to west.

TWIN CITIES REEL UNDER POWER CUTS AND WATER SHORTAGE

If all this was not bad enough, residents of Vasai and Virar are also braving longer power cuts and water shortage. In some areas of Vasai, the power cut has lasted for more than 36 hours.

“For 36 hours without power, we have been facing a harrowing time. On Tuesday, I thought the Arabian Sea waters had entered our streets and homes,” said Nabendu Bhowmick, 39, a resident of Vrindavan Apartment, Evershine City, Vasai (East).

Power supply was disconnected early on Tuesday after water entered the electrical substation at Vasai, affecting 16 feeders. “Worse, there is acute shortage of drinking water,” said Bhowmick, who works as a deputy superintendent with the salt department, Bhayandar. He said he had not reported for work since Monday as there was no water for bathing.

He lives with his wife, Tista, and a 14-year-old son, who had to skip school for similar reasons.

We don’t know what’s been happening as the TV has been rendered useless without power. We used an inverter, but it conked off after three hours,” said Tista.

Mumbai’s neighbouring towns Virar, Virar and Nallasopara had received heavy rain for three days on the trot starting from Sunday. In some areas, rain water has not receded.

“We were relieved that it did not rain in the afternoon today,” said Bhowmick. The power cut has hit senior citizens hard as they were forced to use staircase.

Pandurang Patil, chief public relations officer, MSEDCL, said the power supply was restored partially in phases by Wednesday evening. “We had to shut power as a precaution since water entered the Vasai substation,” he said.

With no water and power, Bhowmick is uncertain as when he will report for work.

Meanwhile, streets in Vasai and Virar wore a deserted look with shops and ATMs shut. Some people have termed three days of torrential rains worse that the 2005 deluge.

In August, most of its solar panels were reportedly damag ed in floods that shut the airport for two weeks.

The flooding was not surprising since the airport, opened in 1999, was built after diverting a tributary of the Periyar river as shown in the map below.

In the past, bad planning and design have led to the shut down of major airports, including Mumbai , Chennai and Delhi . Yet, not much has been learned from such disasters: a new airport is being built by diverting the Ulwe river near Panvel Creek in Navi Mumbai.

Here are some of India’s other airports that are vulnerable to disaster because they have been planned and designed in flagrant disregard of environmental common sense.

Mumbai

Both the Mumbai airport’s runways obstruct the flow of the Mithi river. The first runway, along with the taxiway, extends over a culvert on the river while the second encroaches upon the river itself. When the river flooded in 2005, the airport had to be closed.

Chennai

In 2011, the Chennai airport’s second runway covered a culvert on the Adyar river. In December 2015, when heavy rainfall led to water from the Chembarambakkam lake being released into the Adyar, the airport was one of the first major installations to be completely flooded.

Jaipur

Jaipur’s second runway was completed in 2016. Like in Chennai and Mumbai, the runway was extended on a water channel connecting a series of tanks in the city.

Tirupati

The airport in Renigunta is built between a series of tanks. As these maps show, it encroaches on lake beds, which are also threatened by much built-up growth and plotted development.

Visakhapatnam

The entire roof of the Visakhapatnam airport was damaged in the 2014 Hudhud cyclone. India’s eastern coast is prone to strong cyclonic winds. Why was the roof not designed to withstand them?

Navi Mumbai

Not learning from disasters recent and past, the Rs 16,000 crore Navi Mumbai International Airport is being built by filling and diverting the Ulwe river flowing into the Panvel creek. The landfilling is already causing flooding in nearby villages.

New Delhi

The airport’s swanky new terminal, T3, was built on one of the lowest points of the chosen site. The graph below represents the cross section along the red line marking the location of Terminal 3. It shows that when it rains, water from surrounding higher grounds flows to this point, the reason for the airport’s flooding in 2011 and 2013.

“The data will be sent to the disaster management department, and used to give early warnings to low-lying areas,” said VH Khankar, chief engineer, storm water drains department.

Khankar said the transmitters were procured from Germany. We are hoping to install and make use of all seven this monsoon,” said .

At present, the Mithi river has an instrument — installed in 2007 according to the Chitale committee report suggestions — but this does not transmit data to the disaster management department.

The BMC hopes that with sensors giving it real-time updates on the water levels, it can prevent flooding and destruction to homes, as had taken place in August last year, when an overflowing Dahisar river affected the homes of people living nearby.

“We currently do not have a mechanism to check if river levels are rising and if evacuation warnings are necessary. With these transmitters, the data will be directly communicated to the disaster management department, which can then warn and clear areas,” said a senior civic official.

Like the Siddhivinayak trust, various other religious organisations are also extending a helping hand to those affected by floods in Kerala.

Sri Guru Singh Sabha at Dadar has been conducting a collection drive on the gurudwara premises. As a part of the drive, eight volunteers from the gurudwara have been sent to Kerala to help the victims there. The first set of volunteers left the city with four tonnes of goods on Wednesday afternoon.

Kulwant Singh, the vice-president of the sabha, said that the volunteers carried milk powder, sanitary napkins, rice, sugar and dal, and will be working along with Khalsa Aid, an international NGO, in Kerala.

“Our tickets got confirmed at the last minute under special reservation, and the railways took into consideration that we are carrying relief grains to Kerala. So they didn’t charge us for the four tonnes of raw materials that we were carrying along with us. In fact, they even carried out the packing of the parcels,” said Manjeet Singh, a volunteer from the sabha, who went to Kerala.

More than 100 mosques and eidgahs across the state also collected donations worth more than ₹10 lakh. A student group has also sent funds raised by selling skins of sacrificed animals during Eid for flood relief work in Kerala.

The collection was conducted by various masjids, trusts and NGOs, following which food supplies and medical aid would be purchased and sent to the flood-affected state. “While we celebrated Eid yesterday, we cannot forget that our brothers and sisters in Kerala are in pain.

The residents of 10 villages are currently being rehabilitated near Wadghar, Dapoli and Wahal. However, villagers from Pargaon, Dungi, Owle, Dapoli and Bhangarpada will not be resettled as these areas do not fall under the main airport land. Cidco, which has acquired this land, gave the villagers a compensation package instead. It also assured them that they will be given contracts for 50% of the airport pre-development work, for which they must form societies.

“As agreed upon, Cidco should ensure that the work is divided equally between the PAPs. Four societies from Dunga village have been given work, while Pargaon has been ignored. This is not right,” said Sadashiv Patil, a Pargaon panchayat member.

He added that the village is surrounded on both sides by a creek and as such, the water level rises during the high tide. “Owing to landfilling, water has started entering the village. We are facing the threat of floods, but Cidco failed to act. Hence, we organised the morcha and put a stop to the pre-development work. If Cidco does not take corrective steps, we will intensify our agitation,” he said.

Cidco vice chairman and managing director Bhushan Gagrani, however, said the work was progressing according to schedule and had not been stalled.

“We will take steps to ensure there is no threat of flood in the region. We will ask CIF Pune or IIT-Powai for their assistance in this matter.

Navi Mumbai: The floods in Kerala have pushed the prices of spices imported from that State by at least 25%.

“Each spice has a season and they are kept in cold storage till the next season. So the prices of the spices in the storage have gone up as the crops in Kerala have been affected and there will be a shortage in the next season as well,” a trader from APMC market said on Tuesday.

The spices that come from Kerala are nutmeg (jaiphal), dry mace (javantri), cloves (lavang), green cardamom (elaichi/velchi), dry ginger (sonth), and black pepper (kali miri). Green cardamom comes only from Kerala while others are also imported from other countries.

Nutmeg that used to cost around ₹600 is now ₹800 per kg. Dry mace which was available between ₹1,300 and ₹1,800 per kg, is now priced between ₹1,500 and ₹2,100. Both these spices, which are also imported from Colombo, was stocked in June. Cloves which are largely procured from Indonesia are not much affected. “Cloves come from Kerala as well, but in a very limited quantity. It costs between ₹900 and ₹1,100 and there is a price rise of ₹50 to ₹100,” Bhavesh Vitha, a trader from APMC market, said.

Green cardamom which is traded only from Kerala is supplied twice a year: July and December. The rate of green cardamom which was between ₹1,100 and ₹1,200 now stands at ₹1,400 to ₹1,500. The price is expected to increase if the supply gets hit in December. “There will be fluctuations in the prices of the spices depending on the loss Kerala has suffered. As and when we get to know the condition of the crops there, there will be a change in prices,” Mr. Vitha said.

Dry ginger is supplied from Karnataka and Kerala, and also imported from Nigeria and China. The best among them is the one coming from Kochi, and it costs between ₹220 and ₹250 per kg, while earlier it was between ₹150 and ₹170.

Dry ginger is supplied in January, and this time, it is speculated that there will be a delay. “Since the spices don’t get spoilt, we have an option of storing them. The masalas are not something used on a daily basis, so the common man won’t feel the pinch of the price rise,” Kirti Rana, director, Navi Mumbai Merchants Chamber, said.",issue,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","August 8, 2018",Present,Kerala,344 mm,100 billion Indian rupees,400+,"Loss of crops, infrastructure, and homes","The floods have caused a shortage of spices in the market, and prices have increased by 25%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Since a medical team of 100 members from Maharashtra left for Kerala last week to provide aid to flood-affected people, at least 12,000 patients have been tended to at 100 relief camps. For the past three days, the doctors are going door-to-door in an attempt to reach those who cannot visit the camps.

On August 20, a team of 55 doctors from JJ hospital and 26 doctors from Pune’s Sassoon hospital, along with 14 paramedics and other officials left for Thiruvananthapuram. They carried three trucks of medicines, including antibiotics, intravenous fluids, painkillers, multi-vitamins and prophylactic drugs.

On Saturday, the Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration (FDA) collected medicines worth Rs 40 lakh — donations from chemists and pharmaceutical companies — to send to Kerala. According to D R Gahane, holding charge of the joint commissioner (drugs), FDA, Mumbai, most medicines were antibiotics.

“A lot of chemists came forward to make voluntary contributions. Under Minister Girish Bapat, we decided to help supply medicines, as infections will now be on the rise in Kerala,” said S S Mohite, FDA joint commissioner (intelligence).

Dr Arshad Khan, the chief camp coordinator for Maharashtra government, who reached Alleppey from Ernakulam last Saturday, said: “Most cases are of fever, fungal infections on hand and feet, and wounds on limbs. We anticipate cases of water-borne diseases in the two-three weeks. As precaution, prophylactic medicines, mostly Doxycycline, are being distributed.”

The team members have been divided in groups of 25 each to work in Alleppey, Thrissur, Ernakulam and Pathanamthitta districts. On the first day of the camp, around 2,600 patients had been screened. On the second day, 2,000 patients were treated.

The team includes general physicians, gynaecologists, paediatricians, ENT doctors, surgeons and preventive social medicine specialists. “In 50 per cent of the areas where we are camping, the water has receded. In some areas, we have to wade through water to reach the patients. In Alleppey, there are still some areas that are flooded,” said Khan. The doctors realised that senior citizens and physically challenged residents may require home visits and following that the door-to-door visits began. Doxycycline is also being distributed in these areas.

Officials led by Medical Education Minister Girish Mahajan said few cases of snake bites are also being reported as water levels are receding. “We are also getting a lot of insect bite cases,” one of the camp doctors said. A medical education department official said: “The team has attended to around 12,000 people in the camps.” One of the teams is expected to return to Maharashtra by Monday.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Few dabbawalas who reached out to lonely senior citizens

Any chance of more cancellations?

If the heavy rains continue, the service may be affected again, they say

WEATHER WARNING

DID YOU KNOW?

Mumbai stopped right in its tracks after the onslaught of rains for the past four consecutive days. The heavy downpour slammed life out of gear in Mumbai, leaving streets and railway tracks flooded, mile-long traffic snarls and stranded commuters. It also claimed an exceptional victim — the city’s dabbawala . That’s right. Known to be unstoppable, the city’s 125-year-old meal delivery system, which works at clockwork precision, was thrown off track owing to the incessant deluge, in a rare case.Having withstood almost every challenge to date, the Harvard-recognised six-sigma organisation cancelled their delivery of over two-lakh tiffins to office-goers in the city owing to the harsh weather. Affirms Subhash Talekar , spokesperson of the Mumbai Dabbawala Association , “Our team of over 5,000 dabbawalas could not deliver two lakh dabbas yesterday owing to the heavy rains. Sabse zyada, South Mumbai mein service affect hua — Churchgate, Nariman Point aur Lower Parel. Sixty per cent dabbas yahan se aatey hain and this area was flooded.”Dabbawalas bringing the service to a halt is unheard of, however, they took a call to cancel the service after much deliberation. Subhash Talekar adds, “We had been gauging the situation for the last two days. When heavy rains continued for the fourth consecutive day, we received news that the Borivali-Virar trains were closed. We realised it was going to be difficult to operate as many of our staff come from there. Finally at 7 am, we decided to cancel the dabbas.” The dabbawallas personally called their customers to inform them. “Most of them had already decided to stay home as they could not venture out due to the flooding in their areas. Our dabbawalas ferry the tiffins on cycle and. We may manage to maneuver on the roads, but with many areas in almost waist-level water, we decided against doing that this time.?” he asks.Dabbawala Rohidas Sawant, who operates on the Dadar-Thane route, is home today. “I had ventured out early to try and reach Dadar, but I had to go back halfway. It took me three hours to return. Last yearsituation Sion-Dadar,” he says.From a team of 5,000, one or two dabbawalas chose to deliver to places where senior citizens reside. “One or two dabbawalas did go to Mazagaon, Gamdevi, Babulnath and Colaba . One of our staff stays at Kalyan. He came to Byculla where he operates just to reach the dabbas to a few aged patrons and said, ‘If I do not go, who will feed them?’ We are proud of him,” informs Talekar.“It depends as heavy rains have been forecast this week. If the rains increase and the trains stop, what option do we have? The locals are the lifeline —if they are affected, we get affected,” states Talekar.In Mumbai, rains may not slow down. The Regional Meteorological Centre, Mumbai, says, “Continuous rain with extremely heavy falls at one or two places are likely over the city and suburbs for the next 24 hours.”Dabbawalas cancelled their service in August 2017 for a day due to heavy rains.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

The task was/is daunting: more than 370 people dead, over one million housed in 3,270 relief camps, more than 20,000 houses washed away, nearly 10,000kms of roads damaged, the total loss running into R20,000 crore. A hitherto much-vilified chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan turned into an unlikely role model. That the union government parted with a tiny fraction of his demand for relief package, that right-wing trolls mocked the flood as retribution for Kerala’s beef-eating practices and its government’s support for women’s entry into Sabarimala temple added to his stature.

The debate over the cause of the flood is raging. Did natural causes lead to the flood or was the unusually high rainfall exacerbated by development policies? The Madhav Gadgil-authored Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel report had pointed out the need to protect the state’s ecology. Gadgil has now warned that parts of Maharashtra and Goa could see similar devastation. Unusual or extreme rain events, flash floods and landslides are more possible than thought earlier.

The first learning from Kerala is that it is possible to de-politicise rescue and relief operations. Political parties accept in principle that a huge natural calamity should not be politically exploited but do not hesitate to blame the government of the day, slam its shortcomings on prime time television, and play blame-games. Kerala’s politicians showed that it is possible – and recommended – to join forces across party divides in the hour of need. During the crises days, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala was shoulder to shoulder with Vijayan.

The second learning is that it is important that top officials should be seen on the ground. From cabinet ministers to opposition leaders and bureaucrats, they were all braving the knee-high flood waters and aiding the rescue operation. It sent out a powerful reassuring message to those stranded; importantly, it signalled serious intent to the state’s machinery. This was very different from top most officers of Maharashtra or Mumbai sitting in “war rooms” to “monitor” the situation.

The third learning is that social or civic capital of a state or city must be drafted into government/official efforts. Local people know the lay of the land, have networks beyond those of the government, can prove to be differentiating factor between disorganised and competent rescue operations. Temples, mosques, churches all turned into relief shelters. The fisher folk of Kerala, who negotiate water better than others, turned into unlikely rescuers – now generously lauded.

The fourth learning is that accurate, credible and regular information makes a critical difference between panic and relative calm. Irrespective of the content on the social media, CM Vijayan held a televised news conference every day during the worst days. He spoke directly to people, apprised them of the latest situation, redirected resources, kept lines of communication open in his office 24x7 to receive distress calls which were passed on to the National Disaster Response Force teams, the Army and other defence personnel involved in the operation.

The fifth learning is about the media. The local media, from what one knows, were unlike the hyper-ventilating channels usually seen. Many eschewed regular ad breaks – therefore, revenue – to focus on the flood coverage, changed their formats, became collection points for calls from people stranded in flood water but instead of putting it all on air passed on the information to the CM’s office. Anchors did not swim in the flood water only for cameras.

Valuable lessons, indeed, for Mumbai to take note.

In 2015, unprecedented and sudden floods paralysed Chennai with over 18 lakh people being displaced. Following this, at the behest of the office of the Principal Scientific Advisor to government of India, research institutions, chief among them the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), Chennai, and IITs, got together to build a flood warning system customised for use in Chennai. Carrying the acronym C-FLOWS, which stands for Chennai FLOod Warning System, the six-module ensemble can predict flooding due to heavy rainfall, sea-level rise and increase in water levels of the three rivers — Cooum, Adyar and Kosasthalaiyar — that traverse the city.

Ward-level data

“The State government shared data such as ward boundaries, population details, infrastructure available across Tamil Nadu, which have been used in the warning system,” says M. V. Ramana Murthy, Director, NCCR. The topography data was obtained from the Indian Remote Sensing programme. “Next we plan to develop such a system for Mumbai city and Cochin area,” he adds.

Knowing the elevation at different spots, the system can predict the way the area would flood based on different scenarios that have been simulated. Inputs were taken from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on forecast and National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), which gives the prediction for rain 10 days in advance. Similarly, INCOIS gives the hydrodynamic congestion such as storm surge and tide etc. Using this, the system can, two weeks ahead of the event, simulate the scenario. “The system can predict what would happen at the level of individual wards,” says Tune Usha, scientist with the NCCR and one of the key persons behind the development of C-FLOWS. “We can now apply it to the Greater Chennai Corporation area of 462 sq. km,” she adds.

Thus, early warnings could be issued. “The flood itself cannot be avoided, but it can be managed and the disaster mitigated,” says Dr Usha.

The spatial database of the city which contains all administrative layers, details of ward boundaries, infrastructure, details of elevations and surfaces, soil, land use, geomorphology and census datasets are contained in the first module. There are many precomputed scenarios of flooding based on the forecast rainfall and tidal conditions, in a library. From this the most appropriate one may be selected for superimposing on the geomorphology. The second module has to do with this precisely. Simultaneously, models can also be run in real time based on actual datasets. Over this can be overlaid details of storm water drains and drainage fractions to enable pre-flood planning operations.

The 3D visualisation module makes possible a realistic visualisation of the flooding in various places such as infrastructure, buildings, roads, ward boundaries etc, by superimposing the model outputs on the layers of data.

Convergence

Data from IMD, NCMRWF, INCOIS and Tamil Nadu State government are brought together in an online hub along with the field data and the remote sensing data to observe the situation in real time. This is the fourth module.

Authorised personnel can use a mobile app, which has been developed alongside, to collect data from flooded areas such as geotagged photographs and add to the database. This fifth module helps capture the ground reality and provide primary information for decision makers to plan relief and mitigation operations.

The last aspect is a decision support system: this is an online GIS query portal which can answer questions on quantum of flooding in specific localities, flood proximity, for example, it can say which roads are inundated and suggest routes for planning relief operations and so on.

According to Dr. K Satyagopal, Principal Secretary and Commissioner, Revenue Administration and Disaster management, C-FLOWS will be integrated with TN-SMART, a portal being developed by his department.",solution,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city,1000 mm,USD 1 billion,500,18 lakh people displaced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,error
270,270,mumbai,2018,https://citizenmatters.in/mumbai-monsoon-flooding-advanced-locality-management-municipality-bmc-7286,19 Mar 2020,Mumbai monsoons: Are citizens passing up a chance to solve the flooding issue?,"It no longer comes as a surprise to anyone — the annual monsoon headlines describing how India’s megapolis Mumbai is gasping to keep its head above floods caused by heavy rain, while citizens rue that there is little they can do to dam it.

Still, sometimes, there are fledgling ideas that do lead to action, even if at a hyperlocal level. Radha, a citizen activist from Lokhandwala Residents’ Association at an apartment in a shopping-cum-residential area got into the act immediately. She says that when her locality was getting flooded, the main cause of the excessive water was found to be faulty engineering. Garbage was choking a chamber, so the rainwater had no outlet. Immediately (earlier this year), she contacted the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to get the problem fixed.

“We got them to remove the garbage that was choking the first chamber and also asked them to manufacture a second chamber for us,” said Radha.

So now, do they get to live happily ever after? Not really, she says. Civic problems are never-ending: Potholes all over their roads, choked drains and bad chambers. However, her efforts did succeed in resolving some part of the problem.

Why are residents then averse to proactively engage in the problems that affect them so much? Radha’s take on this is interesting and illuminating. “Each citizen is interested only in checking out how safe his or her own house is. Beyond that, there is nothing they do, really. The basic problem is that Mumbaikars nowadays no longer have a 9 to 5 job. They leave for work at 7 and return at 10. So how or why would they want to get involved in community matters during weekends?”

What citizens can do

Is there really something that citizens can do? Actually, there is — at least in letter, and sometimes in spirit. Radha is a member of the Advanced Locality Management (ALM) in the area — a community organisation born out of a very interesting concept introduced in 1997 by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). The original intent behind creating these areas/neighbourhoods with Advanced Locality Management was to identify localities, and get residents to commit themselves to improving the quality of life in those, in close co-operation with the MCGM.

However, the idea to rope in citizens for community participation and governance did not sustain. “ALMs have been quite a failure, on and off. Citizens just do not step forward to assume the mantle of ownership,” said Rahul Kulkarni who deals with civic issues at Praja, a Mumbai NGO.

Kulkarni explains that the ALMs in Mumbai have three stakeholders – citizens, administrators and elected representatives. They are supposed to work together in order to achieve some set guidelines. If they adhere to rules such as monthly meetings, they get some benefits in terms of awards, taxes etc apart from solution of civic issues on priority. But if they don’t, which is most often the case, then it really doesn’t serve much purpose.

ALM rules and guidelines

The first ALM was set up in 2007 at Bandra. After the BMC listing in the late 1990s, 719 ALMs were formed, but a number of them got deregistered over the years for being “inactive and inefficient,” even though the rules are simple.

Once the ALM is registered, the members have to attend monthly meetings, create awareness about garbage segregation, prevent littering and spitting, dispose of dry waste once or twice a week, take up other civic problems and finally present issues to the Zonal Deputy Municipal Commissioner and Additional Municipal Commissioner, through the Officer on Special Duty (OSD) and ALM Ward Co-coordinator.

While the primary objective of ALMs was to drive garbage segregation and efficient waste management, some of them soon began to focus on other issues pertinent to the locality, such as laying of roads, tree cover, street lights, CCTV cameras, hawking activities, safety and security, fighting noise pollution, littering etc. The ALMs also aim to build good rapport between the citizens and officials.

However, today, just about 145 ALMs are functioning – and not all of them very “satisfactorily” either, according to BMC officials. Unsolved disputes and loss of interest among citizens have led to de-registration of several among them.

What the government can do

Subhash Patil, who is the Officer of Special Duty (OSD) and ALM chief, overlooks a staff of – none! He is the one-man army in charge of the ALM efforts for the entire city. However, there are other Assistant Engineers and ward officers who are are not exclusively in charge of ALM duty, but also help the chief to provide technical know-how and skills to citizens.

Patil was quite appreciative of some citizens in the ALM associations at Bandra, Chembur, Dadar, Kandivili, Andheri and Lokhandwala. If people do get involved in a big way, they can make or break things, he said. However, it is difficult to find interested people across the city!

Do they have their monthly meetings regularly? Patil chortled. “No. They just meet every three to four months…”

What about politicians, MLAs or MPs from the area? Politicians are supposed to be part of ALMs too, isn’t it? “Maybe. But the municipality does not like politicians interfering with their work,” explained another officer who did not wish to be named.

The ALM in Mumbai, then, is all about a good idea that doesn’t have a dedicated staff or team to translate it into action. It is like the eternal chicken-and-egg story – should citizens push the government or should the government drive the citizens to do their bit?

Would citizen initiatives like ALM solve flooding problems?

Garbage, the original reason that fuelled the setting up of the ALM, is the focal issue for functional ALMs in Mumbai. A lot of these committees are wired up to separate garbage and ensure rejection of plastic. A few are into natural composting, gardening and tree-plantations. So, how can they help solve drainage issues in the neighbourhood?

A big part of our urban flooding woes — in Mumbai as in other cities — stems from the clogged drainage systems and dumped-upon water bodies due to inefficient solid waste management. That, coupled with the fact that ALMs give citizens an explicit opportunity to take any unresolved civic issues to the concerned Zonal Deputy Municipal Commissioner and Additional Municipal Commissioner, through their OSD & ALM Officer or Ward Co-coordinator, implies that one cannot completely write off the role of the ALM in preventing and addressing flooding issues.

However, it is also equally relevant that in order to elicit an effective response from the government, it becomes important to chase them. As an example, Radha says, “We managed to get waste composters for two buildings from the BMC after considerable effort. However, after that, some people asked us why we couldn’t get them for the smaller buildings nearby, but my reply to that is – I cannot get them all to do everything. They should take action on their own.”

Hema Ramani, from the Bombay Environmental Action Group points out that while waste segregation is an issue in the city, and even related in some ways to the broader problem of flooding, there is really very little that citizens can do on their own. “There is too much concretisation in the city, and a plan to plant some 3,000 trees in a locality does not really help much. There have to be plans to construct round tunnels and have open spaces; solid waste management is a major issue here.”

Rahul Kulkarni says that there are two ways of looking at solutions. Firstly, collect data from the ground and present them to the government for action, as his organisation Praja does.

Secondly, take it as a structural, long-term challenge. By lobbying with elected representatives and bureaucrats, citizens can work out issues at tandem. By approaching the elected Councillors to alert them about the better quality of work here, it is possible to get things done, he said. However, the crucial question is – are the citizens interested?

The real crunch

The other important question here is why the Municipality has been unable to sort out the drainage mess in the city. Is it lack of funds and resources?

“Not in the least,” says Rahul, firmly. Mumbai’s last budget showed that it had Rs 27,000 crore for the city. It doesn’t make it seem under-resourced at all. While the municipality has the maximum number of tasks to take up, it also has a large amount of money to spend. Hence, the problem for the BMC is not non-availability of funds, but non-channelisation of funds. The Commissioner, who is responsible for announcing the budget and allocation of resources, is not accountable to anyone.

The ALM’s role, then, becomes even more crucial.

As the first monsoon cloud flies above Mumbai, the city knows its time to tuck-up their trousers. As the pouring egoistically denies to cease, Mumbai slowly starts drowning itself under the muddy water owing to poor drainage. Roads and railway tracks start disappearing like they never existed and astonishingly cars get transformed into amphibious vehicles. Troubled residents wait and look for a solution as they somehow manage to tread through the water to rendezvous with their daily lives. Here are some glimpses caught on the lens that shows how the Mumbai rains cripple Mumbaikars’ daily lives.

Click here

During the deluge, 944mm of rain over 24 hours, including 190.3mm between 3.30pm and 4.30pm, combined with a high tide of 4.48m resulted in severe flooding in the river’s catchment area of 7,295 hectares.

The river, which meets the Arabian Sea at Mahim creek, starts at the Vihar and Powai lakes and passes through several areas of the city’s suburbs

Also, less than 5% of the river has been planned for treatment, said the 243-page report. “It is important to note that of the 124 million litres a day (MLD) that flows into Mithi, only 6 to 8 MLD is planned for treatment,” said the report. This means effectively, 95% of the river is sewage, according to an expert who prepared the report.

The report, prepared by the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT-B) and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), along with two independent experts, is likely to be discussed by the SC on December 7.

The report was submitted on March 13 by then additional chief secretary Satish Gavai. The matter was based on a petition filed by environment group Vanashakti. On August 16, 2017, SC had ordered the formation of a panel to ensure pollution in the river reduces and its restoration begins soon, while slamming the state for not taking any steps to rectify the situation over 12 years. The government deposited ₹50 lakh with the court for expenses incurred by the committee to study and restore the river. “As large-scale urbanisation, encroachments, and development have taken place in the river basin, a repeat of the 2005 deluge is inevitable,” the report concluded. “Earlier committees recommended the removal of encroachments along the river with a minimum buffer of at least 15m. However, even after 13 years since the deluge, this work is not complete and the issue of encroachment removal has not been taken seriously by authorities. Hence, the river has become a solid waste dumping yard and gets polluted owing to sewage entering directly from slums…,” the report concluded.

The report identified Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) as a source for flooding and called for an immediate need to widen bridges. “The major problem of flooding is because of reclamation(620 hectares) for BKC and owing to the bottleneck forming of non-widened bridges at the downstream of the river,” it read. “It is a damning report about the current condition of the river, but it clearly establishes the loopholes and how state agencies need to work in tandem to revive this water body,” said Gavai, currently posted as additional chief secretary (industries), Maharashtra . “We need to take inspiration from the revival of Europe’s Rhine River, which was many times more polluted than Mithi, but countries like Austria, Switzerland, Germany, France and the Netherlands came together to develop a robust restoration plan.”

From extremely poor water quality, poor infrastructure, inappropriate construction of roads, setting up of unauthorised industries, and slum settlements, the report collated by four scientists from NEERI, led by director Dr Rakesh Kumar, three scientists from IIT-B, professor AD Sawant and architect PK Das, divided Mithi into 15 zones and suggested short-term and long-term restoration measures for each zone to be ‘implemented at the earliest’.

“Areas around BKC not only have slums, but massive buildings that have been illegally constructed on floodplains. Construction of retaining walls in areas around Aarey Colony and further towards Sanjay Gandhi National Park can be disastrous for such areas as the interaction with the river reduces significantly,” said a committee member. Other committee members refused to comment as the matter is being heard by SC and remains sub-judice.

The report compared recommendations from nine previous committee reports between 2006 and 2017, including the one by the Chitale committee soon after the 2005 deluge and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). The recommendations directed government bodies to put a stop to industrial effluent discharge and setting up sewage treatment plants (STPs) to capture domestic waste from adjoining encroachments. “However, it has been observed that no proper planning and execution work was carried out,” read the report, adding that unauthorised industries continued to dump effluents in the river.

The committee said the construction of service roads along the river banks was not done, the construction of a river flushing system for swift rejuvenation as directed by the Chitale committee was never implemented, and the development of flood risk maps for rainfall levels every year post 2005 was not prepared.

“The retaining walls constructed along Mithi are not constructed the way they should have been for an urban river. The committee found there was no coordination between different agencies for the planning and execution of the river-related work,” the report said.

BMC to challenge

An additional municipal commissioner from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) closely associated with the river rejuvenation plan said they had been carrying out civil and environmental engineering solutions over the past 13 years. “The BMC has removed more than 60,000 encroachments across the river’s length. Based on recommendations of the Chitale report, the river wall was built and new stormwater drains were constructed. Proof of this has been witnessed over the past two years when during monsoon Mithi did not overflow, which had been happening regularly over the past two decades,” the officer said. “There is a lot of change since 2005 and there has been a significant improvement. We will be telling SC about our version when this report is discussed.”

The officer said, “At first, IIT-B had suggested the use of wetland technology to clean up the river, but it failed because the area had too many encroachments. We decided to float a tender and hire an international consultant in 2015-16 that carried a flow study where of the 398 million litres , the current flow of the river is 8 million litres, which means 390 million litres is sewage. There are 73 major and medium nullahs emptying into the Mithi,” the official said, adding, “Based on this, we broke Mithi into three parts under the revival project at about ₹1,000 crore.”

The first part started from Vihar Lake going up to a portion of a compound in Powai, a distance of about 3km, where an STP was commissioned and this cost was ₹100 crore. The STP is under construction, the BMC officer said. Part two from Powai compound to CST bridge, sewage will be collected and taken to already existing STPs, the officer added. “The third part is from CST Bridge to Mahim creek. We will build interceptor sewers and the collected sewage will be treated at Bandra STP.”

Rajiv Kuknoor, deputy municipal commissioner, said, “Work is underway in full swing in part one with the STP under construction. Draft tenders for the other parts are ready and over the next 15 days, the tenders for these will be published. It will take three months to develop the work order, prepare a scrutiny report for the tenders and then work will start,” he said.

It’s all sweet talk when it comes to the authorities’ promises on reviving Mithi River, 13 years after a deluge killed more than 1,000 people, in part owing to the deplorable condition of the city’s largest river.

Encroachments, reclamation, improperly built retaining walls, indiscriminate dumping of industrial effluents and solid waste have made the 17.84km river ‘an open drain’, and consequently, left the city vulnerable to a deluge similar to the one on July 26, 2005, according to a report submitted by the state government to the Supreme Court (SC).

During the deluge, 944mm of rain over 24 hours, including 190.3mm between 3.30pm and 4.30pm, combined with a high tide of 4.48m resulted in severe flooding in the river’s catchment area of 7,295 hectares.

Local residents andworkers inperformed ‘last rites’ of Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) on Sunday to protest against the flooding allegedly resulting from illegal construction by developers and for leaving citizens in the lurch.The protesters met the VVMC Commissioner Satish Lokhande and demanded immediate action against those involved in. They also submitted a letter to Lokhande complaining that constructions on the wetland had choked the major drains in the area leading to waterlogging everywhere.“Due to the rampant illegal constructions, many natural drainage channels have been closed, and hence water is not flowing from there. The civic body has not built even a single water-holding pond in the past eight years. The drainage lines have also not been cleaned properly by the contractors,’’ the letter said.“The flooding that caused so much of distress to citizens could have been averted had adequate steps been taken before the monsoon. Had the drainages been cleaned properly and the drains clogged with construction debris been opened to discharge the water, there would have been no problem. However, the civic body did not pay attention to it. Many areas remained under water till Friday evening, and there is no electricity in many houses even now also,’’ said Kiran Chendvankar,corporator from Manikpur area.“The VVMC is good for nothing. It left the people in the lurch, so we decided to perform its last rites,”’ said Chendvankar.“We have urged the municipal commissioner to open all the drainages that have been blocked due to illegal structures and dumping of debris and sand on wetland. The residents have been bearing huge financial losses on a daily basis for the past one week due to the waterlogging,” said Milind Chavan, a local resident and Sena worker.The Vasai Virar and Nalasopara areas were underwater from Monday to Friday with no power and water supply. Even as the life was limping back to normalcy, it started raining heavily on Sunday morning. There was waterlogging in many areas again.“We were about to heave a sigh of relief when it started raining again. We are still in trauma after the flooding and will not go out,’’ said Rahil Shaikh, a resident of Nalasopara.The civic body, however, claimed that the water has been cleared from roads and that it is well prepared to tackle the situation.Though the Opposition parties and residents are blaming illegal constructions and unplanned urban development for the floods, the VVMC claims that heavy rains, high tides and mangroves in the drainage have caused the flooding and waterlogging.“There is a growth of mangroves in the major nullahs which is creating hurdles in the flow of water and it’s causing waterlogging. We have checked all the drainage channels, and found that many mangroves have grown at thewhich flows all water of Vasai Virar and Nakadi areas into the Bhayander Creek from Rakhavali. The other channels are free and are not choking the water. There was also a small embankment at Rajavali bridge which has been demolished.

275,275,mumbai,2018,https://thewire.in/government/as-mumbai-rains-wreck-havoc-slum-dwellers-the-worst-affected,16 Jul 2018,"As Mumbai Rains Wreak Havoc, Slum Dwellers the Worst Affected","Mumbai: Lavanya was born only six months ago. Even so, she has been uprooted three times already. Once, when the forest department demolished her parents’ house in the Bheemchaya Nagar slum in the eastern suburbs of Mumbai on June 1. She then spent a few days in Buddha Vihar, in the slums where her family shifted along with 350 others affected in the demolition. And now, finally, she is living in a makeshift structure made of tarpaulin and bamboo in the same place where their houses once stood.

Moving houses has had an adverse effect on the infant. And the incessant July rains coupled with open drainage, overflowing garbage and lack of sanitation facilities have only made things worse. “For the past one month, my child (Lavanya) has been suffering from fever and skin rashes. No amount of treatment is helping her,” her mother Sakshi Kamble says.

Mumbai has been hit badly by incessant heavy rains over the last week. Flooded streets, water on railway tracks shutting down services and the collapse of walls and balconies are a regular feature during the monsoons – this time, the effects have been devastating. In Vasai/Virar, on the outskirts of the city, flooding lasted for over four days, and residents were holed up at home without electricity or food.

Most affected have been those who live in ‘informal housing’ – slums and makeshift huts – where public services are meagre even at the best of times.

During a break in the downpour, families such as the Kambles slowly started taking stock of the damages caused due to rains. Most of the flimsy makeshift structures made of tarpaulin and bamboo post-demolition had leaked and water had entered the houses. Built over a marshland on the adjoining mangroves, which is now termed as a “protected land” by the forest department, most houses have water seeping through the cracks and crevices on the mud ground. The Kambles’ shanty too was flooded in the rains.

“As soon as the rain stopped, we tried to fill in the floor with some sand and gravel. We were afraid rodents would enter through open burrows and infest my house, making my child sicker. But all the raw material was confiscated by the forest guards posted outside the basti,” said Bhimrao Kamble. Forest guards at the entry of the basti have been keeping vigil and disallowing any work in the area. Police are called in each time the residents here resist these raids.

This is not the first time the basti has been demolished during the monsoon. “In 2005, when the entire settlement of over 800 houses was demolished, the civic authorities had come during the monsoons to flatten our structures,” Usha Baile, another resident of the slum, told The Wire. This demolition pattern is not unique to the Bheemchaaya Nagar slums. In fact, often demolitions in the city are carried out at the start of the monsoon every year, when the residents are at their most vulnerable.

“The damage is maximum that way. The officials think this will deter us from squatting back on the land and strike right when the weather is most threatening,” said Vishal Tambe, a community leader from the Govinda wadi slums near Kalyan creek in Thane district, where over 30 families have been squatting for over two decades. Some structures were demolished in Govinda wadi too in June this year.

Most slums in the city that were built beyond the datum line of 2000, an arbitrary but official deadline decided for the city, face the threat of eviction and demolition constantly. Even though the courts have on several occasions upheld the slum dwellers’ rights and directed the state to make alternative accommodation available before carrying out demolitions, these safeguards are rarely available to the poor.

The slums of Mumbai and adjoining areas provide the city with its informal workforce. Most people staying here are migrants who have over years the shifted to the city as an escape from the harsh living conditions back home. Each family here has backstories of escaping from caste atrocities, floods, earthquakes or failed crops.

Official estimates say that about 50% of the city’s population – 12 million within municipal limits and more beyond – is living in slums, though the figure could be much higher. Residents, who look for dwellings that are close to their area of work, are the backbone of the city – working as domestic workers, roadside hawkers, taxi drivers and cleaners in the city. Phenomenally expensive housing has meant that even the lowest rung of white-collar workers have had to move into informal housing. For many, their living conditions are precarious and missing out on a day of work would mean missing the day’s crucial income.

Bhushan Waghmare, a resident of Shanti Nagar slums in Wadala, a city suburb, lost four days’ income during the rains. “My house was flooded and I had to be around my family ensuring they were safe. I could not set out and drive the taxi I have taken on rent. I lost my four days’ wages, and also had to pay the taxi owner the daily cut despite not being able to work at all.”

Basic amenities – toilets, running water, sewers – are conspicuous by their absence because the slum is on encroached land, which means that the civic authorities will not provide any services there. Even the prime minister’s much vaunted ‘Swachh Bharat Mission,’ that aims to build toilets for every household, neglects the slums of Mumbai.

Jai Parmeshwarmati – an activist with Ghar Banao Ghar Bachao Andolan, the largest housing rights campaign in the city, and resident of Sidharth Nagar slums in Mumbai’s western suburbs – says women are the worst affected during the rains. His slum houses 702 families and has no toilet facilities. The residents here collected voluntary donations and built four toilet blocks for community usage, but they too have been lying defunct in the absence of sewage lines and water connections in the slums. “Even the simple act of relieving oneself is a task. Men and women are forced to defecate in the open. Women have to strategise and wait until the sunset to relieve themselves. But during rains, the area gets water-logged and some women wait for days before they can relieve themselves,” Parmeshwarmati says.

With a budget of Rs 25,141 crore, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is India’s richest civic body. Of this, less than 18% gets spent on building the city’s infrastructure; slums hardly figure in the priority list. “We are doomed to live under constant fear of demolition,” Kamble says. During heavy rains, that fear is only heightened.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
276,276,mumbai,2018,https://www.mid-day.com/mumbai/mumbai-news/article/mumbai-rains-why-city-is-most-vulnerable-to-urban-flooding-19628185,22 Jul 2018,Mumbai Rains: Why city is most vulnerable to urban flooding,"The world is dealing with urban flooding with an eye on the future, even as Mumbai is yet to fully implement a storm water drain project recommended in 1993. Ruthless monsoons are the new normal. And BMC alone can't save us

Zoru Bhatena has a complaint that every Mumbaikar will empathise with. The 43-year-old, who has been a resident of Khar for 15 years, says, ""Earlier, it would flood in the area when there was heavy rainfall. Now, it drizzles and there's water everywhere."" When he realised this, Bhatena did something few Mumbaikars would. One day, he set out of home and followed the path of storm water drains in Khar. These led him on a circuitous route through Bandra West, across the railway tracks to Bandra East, then to Bandra terminus from where they are supposed to drain into the Mithi River. What he found throughout were blockages obstructing the flow of water, which explained why, when the rain gets going, gutter water leaks onto Khar's roads.

So, the flowchart is simple, right? Keep the drains free of debris and sewage, and Mumbai will never see floods again? Not really. Professor Kapil Gupta from the department of civil engineering at IIT Bombay, who was part of the flood advisory committee for the BMC, formed after the July 2005 deluge, points out why: Mumbai's drainage system has not been built for the rainfall currently experienced. ""When the British built the drains here, they had no rainfall data. Assuming that Mumbai received four to five times the rain that London did [which was 6 mm per hour], they built drains with a carrying capacity of 25 mm/hour.

Today, the rainfall intensity exceeds 100 mm/hour during severe weather. On July 26, 2005, it reached 196 mm/hour."" He adds that BRIMSTOWAD, the storm water drain project of BMC, that was conceived in 1993 and was one of the top recommendations of the Chitale Committee report, suggested that drains with a carrying capacity of 50 mm/hour during heavy rainfall be built. We already receive more rainfall than that. He gives the example of Navi Mumbai. ""When Navi Mumbai was planned, drains were designed for 168 mm/hour of rainfall, and a large number of holding ponds were also created. Which is why it is coping better than Mumbai,"" he adds.

Waking up to floods

What are we looking at then? On July 10, this year, Vasai-Virar, the fifth largest city in Maharashtra, was inundated with seven-feet water in some places that received 240mm of rainfall in one day. Last year, on August 29, Mumbai reeled under 315.8 mm of rain in 12 hours, one of the city's worst days since the 2005 floods when the city had received 944 mm rainfall in 24 hours. But, Mumbai is not struggling alone.

On December 1, 2015, Chennai received 300 mm rainfall, making it the wettest December day ever recorded in the city. The December norm for the capital of Tamil Nadu is 191 mm. By 5 am, according to a report by the Delhi-based non-profit Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), almost 80 per cent of the city was under four metres of water. Similar events have occurred not just in India — Gurugram, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, or more recently, Ahmedabad, and Delhi — but also Europe, USA, Australia, Japan and China. The phenomenon of urban floods — intense and/or prolonged rainfall, which overwhelms the capacity of the drainage system — has been slowly creeping upon us, aided in most part by climate change and increase in global temperatures.

Mumbai is most vulnerable

Subimal Ghosh, assistant professor, civil engineering department and climate studies at IIT-Bombay, recalls an experience while commuting from Ghansoli in Navi Mumbai to Powai. ""There was severe rainfall on the Eastern Express Highway, while in Powai the situation was milder."" Climate change, rise in global temperature and increased urbanisation are contributing to a change in rainfall patterns as we know it. Ghosh explains that the temperatures in the Arabian Sea, which lines the Mumbai coast, are increasing at an alarming rate, leading to widespread incidents of extreme rainfall in the central region of India, where Mumbai falls.

A study that Ghosh was part of, published in the journal Nature Communications last year, stated that widespread extreme rain — which covers a large enough area to cause largescale floods — have increased threefold over central India from 1950 to 2015. The extreme events, in which daily rainfall exceeds 150 mm, are on the rise at a rate of about 13 events per decade, the study found. And, because the urban landscape included highrises, which obstruct the path of moisture-laden winds, the intense rainfall is concentrated in certain areas.

Imagine the combination of extreme rainfall and low-lying areas. But, why imagine. Hindmata, Sion, Kurla provide fresh examples every year. Gupta says the problem starts with the origins of the city. Once seven separate islands, increased migration has led to land reclamation across Mumbai over the last two centuries in wetlands and mudflats, all of which are low-lying (see: Changing countours of Mumbai). These are the first areas to go under when the heavens open up. The reclaiming, in most parts, he says, has not been based on scientific studies of the area. The increasing density of the suburban population proved another problem. Earlier, there were natural storm water drains created by the gushing flow of water. However, says Gupta, when, residential areas came up, they built walls in drains, and, in some places, reclaimed part of the land.

The survival tactics

Bhathena leads us to a spot near Khar-Danda on Garage Road, where the Guzder bandh stands was built in 1910 to prevent sea water coming into the suburbs. ""In the 1980s, the BMC concretised the road, blocking the flow of sea water. That bandh got destroyed so badly, that it now allows sea water in during high tide,"" Bhatena adds. Blocking water is not a solution. In a February 2018 article for the Down To Earth magazine of CSE, Prof. Dr Dagmar Haase of the geography department of Berlin's Humboldt University, writes, ""After Germany's disastrous Elbe river floods of the last two decades, dikes were relocated and modified to broaden the natural floodplain and to give the river more room. Yet, the dam burst four years ago. That is why, instead of blocking the water, other cities think of welcoming it."" She, and others, cite the example of the Netherlands' Adaptive Pathway Approach, a plan that even our neighbour Bangladesh has adopted.

Marjolijn Haasnoot, an expert in water resources management and environmental modelling, at Deltares (an independent institute for applied research in the field of water and subsurface in the Netherlands), says the key is to anticipate future change instead of responding to events. (See: Going Dutch). Hasnoot adds that Netherlands has planned sand nourishment of its beaches to maintain the coastline, set new flood risk standards, and increase pump capacity near the Afsluitdijk — the barrier between the Wadden Sea and lake Ijssel. This is all in a bid to meet the challenges it will face by 2050.



Professor Kapil Gupta, IIT Bombay, says post 26/7 they designed a holding pond on the Mithi River at Bamandayapada. This holds 30,000 litres

If the Netherlands is looking at 2050, London is projecting 100 years into the future. The Environment Agency of the UK developed the Thames Estuary 2100 Plan (TE2100) to recommend how to manage tidal flood risk at the end of the century and beyond. The plan foresees how 1.3 million people and £275 billion worth of property will continue to be protected from tidal flood risk.

Mumbai urgently needs an equally far sighted plan. Some of the Chitale committee suggestions were creation of additional gated outfalls, pumping stations, holding ponds and creation of Singapore Marina Barrage for Mumbai. It was also suggested that the administration fix gates for Mumbai lakes, Vihar and Powai, the place from where the Mithi river originates. ""Many of these still haven't been implemented. Why accept the recommendations when there is no time-bound implementation,"" says activist James John of AGNI.

Looking beyond problems

On August 29, last year, as the city's roads got waterlogged, at several spots, manholes were opened in the hope water would drain out. That Tuesday gastroenterologist at Bombay Hospital, Dr Deepak Amarapurkar left work by car to reach his Prabhadevi home. At Elphinstone, he decided to wade through the waters, instead of sitting it out in the vehicle. Witnesses say, he fell into an open manhole on the flooded road. Two days later, his body was found in a drain near the Worli seashore.

The BMC, which received severe flak for the tragedy, this year, worked towards ensuring that the spot doesn't get flooded. G-South Assistant Municipal Commissioner, Devendra Jain, who was appointed to the post in January, says in addition to other measures, the capacity of the drainpipes was increased to 50 per cent by converting it into a boxed drain instead of arches. There are the basic steps that can and should be taken.



Waterlogging on Fitwala Road, Elphinstone, has now been fixed thanks to a few structural changes in the drains below, which has led to increase in capacity of the flow

Gupta says, global models are working better at combating urban flooding. ""In Mumbai, you find that areas that never used to flood have started flooding. This is because drains are not being taken care of. If the authorities and citizens maintain the drains regularly and well, 50 per cent of the flooding problems would disappear.""

The city needs its wetlands, depressions where water can stay. These can be natural ponds. ""Look at Thane. The city used to have 101 lakes at one point of time. Now, barely 21 survive. Most of them have been filled and structures constructed on them. And now, we are also witnessing construction of houses on saltpan lands, like in Nalasopara. If water can't flow and drain, it is sure to enter homes and damage property. Thane flooded severely last year,"" he adds. If you think the blame lies only at the gates of the authorities that man Mumbai's drains (BMC, MMRDA, Railways), look in the mirror. ""People have created parking lots on top of drains,"" Gupta says.

And here is something you, the individual can do. Gupta suggests that housing societies and buildings start storing rain water. Recharging the ground water might not be a good solution in Mumbai, as the water is already saturated because of the sea. ""Instead, every building should collect rainwater in Sintex tanks. Even if one building stores 1,000 litres, that's every 10 buildings saving 10,000 litres. That's 10,000 litres of water not running off onto the roads."" Bhatena has a few more suggestions for citizen participation in preventing flooding. We can start with adhering to building laws.

""The rule is that every building should leave 25 per cent of its plot area as an open space, that's open to the sky, where they can create a garden. Also, there should be one tree for every sq metre. So, a building that stands on a 10,000 sq ft plot, should have 300 trees. But, nobody follows this."" That buildings today are creating basements for multi-level parking also means that water can't seep in. ""Water has to go somewhere, doesn't it?"" And it has. Into our homes.

According to media reports, around 15 cars got damaged when the compound wall and internal road of Lloyd’s Estate, a housing society in Wadala, caved in. Residents were also asked to evacuate the society temporarily for authorities to inspect the building. Though the temporary evacuation is sure to upset the residents’ lifestyle for a while, they have some recourse in insurance for the losses they might have suffered as far as damages to vehicles are concerned. Others can gear up to bear the brunt of monsoon showers by buying the right car and home insurance policies.

Damage to your car

Floods are bad news for vehicle owners. If water gets inside the car, it can damage the interiors or worse the car engine. “The own damage cover of a car insurance policy will pay for any damage to upholstery or built-in electronics of the car like the stereo system, but if there are add-ons like the policyholder has installed a high-end stereo instead of a built-in stereo, it will have to be declared and insured by paying extra premium,""said Sanjay Datta, chief underwriting and claims, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd.

For affected Mumbai residents, though, car damage also occurred due to landslide and roads caving in but they can make a claim. “Damage to vehicles in this case is accidental and hence insured. The policyholder needs to inform the insurer as soon as possible. The car will have to be pulled out of the debris, towed to the workshop which will then assess the repair cost,"" said Sasikumar Adidamu, chief technical officer, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd.

“In case the repair cost is more than the insured declared value (IDV), it will be seen as total loss and the entire IDV will be paid to the customer,"" he added. The value of your car depreciates each year and IDV is the sum insured that’s calculated based on the invoice of your car minus depreciation. However, there are certain items that the insurer will not pay for.

It gets tricky when driving on a flooded road damages the car engine. If the vehicle is flooded and you continue to drive or start the engine, the water gets sucked into the engine and damages it. So, when you see water levels reach the middle of the wheel, don’t attempt to start or drive your car. If you do, any damage to the engine will not be considered accidental but consequential damage which isn’t paid by the insurer.

To cover consequential loss to engine add-on covers engine protect or engine secure can help. But the insurer will deduct depreciation while paying the claim. A zero-depreciation add-on cover will work here.

Damage to your house

Heavy rains and floods can also cause considerable damage to your house and home insurance helps as it covers the structure as well as the contents of the house. “Home insurance packs in fire insurance and insurance against burglary. Fire insurance covers the building and the contents against 12 perils, including storm, tempest, inundation and flood. So if your house is damaged due to a landslide caused by floods you can claim insurance,"" said Kapil Mehta, co-founder, SecureNow Insurance Brokers Pvt. Ltd.

It also packs in covers against mechanical or electrical breakdown. Other covers include public liability cover (compensates a third party for losses caused by you), personal accident cover (offers insurance on account of accidental death or total permanent and partial disability due to an accident) and alternate rent cover that pays rentals for the period your house is under repairs due to damages.

However for the residents of Lloyd’s Estate, home insurance will be of little use as there is no damage to the building. “The fire brigade evacuated the residents to ensure their safety. Even if the residents had taken alternate rent cover under the fire insurance policy, since there is no damage to the building from an insured cause, the rent incurred by shifted residents will not be payable by policies,"" said K.G. Krishnamoorthy Rao, managing director and chief executive officer, Future Generali India Insurance Co. Ltd.

But in the case of an actual damage, home insurance helps and so it’s important to understand the basics. Go for a policy on a reinstatement basis and make sure you don’t underinsure yourself. If you live in a building then you could also look at policies that work on the concept of “agreed value"" basis. In the event of a loss, you get the agreed value and the ownership of your house is transferred to the insurer.

Click here

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will send a notice to the contractor for not maintaining the pump, said Vijay Singhal, additional municipal commissioner, in charge of storm water drains department. He added, “If any discrepancies are found, the contractor will also be fined.”

On Monday night, the city recorded 30 minutes and nearly 50 mm of rain.

Besides Malad subway, waterlogging was also reported at Hindamata, some parts of Dadar and Malabar hill, Gandhi market. The BMC said it had received eight complaints of waterlogging from Dharavi, Dadar TT circle, King’s Circle, and parts of Santacruz and Andheri (East).

Similar incident was also repeated last year in June when two of the six dewatering pumps in Matunga police station and Gandhi market stopped functioning owing to technical glitches, which left areas around Matunga waterlogged for over three hours. Following the glitches, civic chief Ajoy Mehta, in his monthly meeting, asked all 24 ward officers and deputy municipal commissioners to assure that the dewatering pumps were in working condition.

The BMC this year identified 298 locations across the city where dewatering pumps have been installed, most of them in island city (102), followed by western suburbs (100) and eastern suburbs (96). On Monday, there were 17 pumps working across the city. After the Central Railway requested the BMC, in addition to 298 locations, pumps were also installed opposite Swadeshi Mill, LBS Road, Kurla and Adhyapak storm water drain at Dharavi.

After Mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar said the BMC can’t be held responsible for waterlogging near Metro sites, the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL) also decided to install 241 de-watering pumps at metro sites where there is possibility of water logging.

A torrential downpour over the past three days has left the satellite townships of Vasai, Virar and Nallasopara – located around 50 km off Mumbai – flooded and residents marooned. In Vasai, the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway in the east, Vishal Nagar, Evershine City, Vasant Nagari, Manikpur and station road on the west of the railway tracks were some of the places that suffered the worst flooding. Both east and west Nallasopara saw flooding. Some of the areas that were inaccessible were Moregaon, Central Park, Manvelpada and Virar Road. While Tuesday saw Vasai receive 299 mm of rain, in the 24 hours ending Wednesday 8.30 am, the area received an average of 242 mm rain.

“We climbed to the terrace after water levels started rising on Sunday night. We left with whatever we had on us – just our clothes – thinking the water would recede in a few hours. Every year our area sees flooding but this time there was three feet water in our house on Tuesday,” said Chauhan.

The street outside, too, was flooded and the underground water tanks are now polluted, leaving little or no potable water for consumption. In the absence of electricity, residents didn’t have any means to charge their phones or pump water into the overhead tanks. Water bottles were short in supply and much in demand at grocery stores and medical shops in the area. “There is no food. Until Wednesday none of the grocery shops were open. Now we are living on biscuits and bread,” said Kiran Chaudhary, another resident of the area who is growing concerned about the health of her four-month-old daughter. Many are carrying pails of the flood water to a toilet in the nearby public school, as there is no water in the taps.

Kiran’s father-in law, Anil, who works as a peon in Khar, said, “In my 16 years in Vasai, I have never seen floods like these. The water is just not receding.”

Even as rains subsided on Tuesday night, the water levels receded only marginally. Evershine City and Vasant Nagari areas remained shut off from the main town throughout the day as a 3-km stretch of road connecting these areas to the railway station was under water.

Many waded through waist-deep water to reach the station only to be disappointed because train services did not resume until noon. Many waded through waist-deep water to reach the station only to be disappointed because train services did not resume until noon.

After an unsuccessful attempt at reaching the station, Shabana Sheikh, a resident of Evershine City, walked till the highway to catch a state transport bus. “Nothing worked. I am just frustrated and going home,” she said.

“It is almost like house arrest because we can’t just step out but then our food stock is running out. We couldn’t even get a packet of milk until Wednesday afternoon. There is some flooding in the area every year but this year is worse because the water level is just not going down,” said Shailen Ashar, a local businessman and resident of Krishna Kanhaiya building in Evershine City.

Tuesday’s high tide, which led to heavy flooding, continued on Wednesday, making matters worse, according to Palghar district collector Prashant Narnaware. “We visited the heavily flooded areas in Vasai and Nallasopara and noticed that water levels in low-lying areas have not reduced much. This is particularly so near the creek. On Tuesday, high tide coupled with heavy rains led to the flood situation. The high tide has continued on Wednesday and our storm water drains are choked. Therefore, the flood water is not flowing into the sea,” said Narnaware.

Meanwhile many residents of Vasai and Nallasopara blamed the civic body’s neglect of infrastructure. Meanwhile many residents of Vasai and Nallasopara blamed the civic body’s neglect of infrastructure.

Since Monday, local authorities rescued around 400 people from the low lying Manikpur saltpan lands and provided them temporary accommodation in Vartak College. However, on Wednesday, as soon as the downpour stopped, several families returned to their still-submerged homes. “It is our home and we are used to the floods. We will take shelter in the temple compound and as soon as water goes down we will retrieve anything of value that is left at home,” said Sakharben Gala, as she prepared to cross neck-high waters to reach the temple.

Meanwhile many residents of Vasai and Nallasopara blamed the civic body’s neglect of infrastructure. “Every monsoon Nallasopara is submerged and it takes two days for the water to recede. The Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC) doesn’t bother cleaning the nullahs or working on the drainage system,” said Amit Goria, 29, a resident of Nallasopara East.

“In most areas where there is flooding, construction is done below the road level. In the past two days, Vasai has received around 700-mm rain, which is unprecedented. Here the direction of water flow is from east to west and due to high tide on Wednesday morning and evening, water is finding resistance to go into the sea. Moreover, the culverts under the railway tracks are too small for water to pass,” said municipal commissioner Satish Lokhande.

Other residents blamed the unplanned and illegal construction along the creek for the calamity. “All of this was built on salt pan lands and along the creek,” said Bhola Patil, a Waliv resident, panning his arm across Manikpur to Evershine City and Vasant Nagari. “Where will storm water go? There is no point for discharge,” he said.

Narnaware told The Indian Express: “Construction on private reclaimed land, which is not illegal, as well as the slums that have come up along the creek are interfering with the natural drainage system of the area. We are working around this problem and are planning a bigger storm water drainage pipe.”

Meanwhile, waterlogging in an electric substation resulted in large scale blackouts across Vasai and Nallasopara on Tuesday morning. Electricity supply was restored in Vasai and surrounding areas at 8.30pm. A source in the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd said that a transmission substation handling high tension wires was submerged in three feet of water on Tuesday morning and power supply was disconnected as a precaution. “Since noon some of the water has receded, and by 4.30 pm three feeder pumps were restored,” said the officer.

In the absence of electricity, hospitals and medicine shops had to depend on inverters. Dr BN Vishwakarma, the resident medical officer of Shree Siddhivinayak Multispecialty hospital in Vasai West, said the hospital saved as much energy as possible for emergency patients. “Because not many could step out, we haven’t had any emergency cases. Some patients complained of bodyache and fever, they were treated. We have kept most of our appliances switched off to save electricity,” he said.",,Vasai-Virar Floods,"Vasai-Virar, Maharashtra, India",2022-07-04,2022-07-06,"['Vasai', 'Virar', 'Nallasopara']","['299 mm, 242 mm']","['Thousands of houses flooded', 'Electricity supply disrupted', 'Train services suspended', 'Food and water shortages']",0,"['Thousands of people stranded', 'Loss of property', 'Disruption of daily life']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Often dams are claimed to be multi-purpose projects, and prevention of floods is cited as one of the purposes of dams because they have something called a flood cushion, which gets filled only when a river is in spate. But floods don’t have any uniform dimension. There are low floods, medium floods, high and very high floods. Many of these are cyclical in nature with high floods taking place in 25, 50 or 100 years. But in this era of climate change, these cycles have gone awry: high to very high floods visit us far more often than before.

Thanks to their flood cushions, dams subsume low and medium-level floods. But these harmless floods should not be controlled because they replenish floodplains with fresh nutrient-rich soil, boost fisheries and rejuvenate the riparian flora and fauna. Such floods also recharge aquifers. Farmers, too, welcome floods for these reasons. The prevention of low and medium-scale floods also provides a false sense of security to the State and people, leading to occupation of flood plains for raising housing colonies, highways, schools, colleges, commercial establishments and even airports as has been done in Mumbai, Chennai and Kochi.

But when high to very high floods come, the flood cushion proves ineffective and counterproductive, necessitating the dam manager to release as much water as possible in as little time as possible to save the structure from damage. Such emergency releases from the dam result in mayhem downstream, since the real flood cushion — the flood plains — are occupied. Flood waters have no place to spread and so they destroy whatever lies in their path. Unfortunately, rainfall, river and nature are blamed for the mess.

The pro-dam lobby often cites the example of Tehri dam in Uttarakhand. They claim it successfully controlled the very high flow in the river Bhagirathi in 2013. Yes, that’s a fact. But it is also a fact that the event took place in June, when the dam reservoir did not have much water, and so could accommodate the sudden high inflows.

What if the extreme event had taken place during the monsoon months of July-September when the reservoir would have been full?

I am yet to get a convincing answer to this question.

281,281,mumbai,2018,https://india.mongabay.com/2018/08/a-normal-monsoon-with-droughts-and-floods/,2 Aug 2018,A ‘normal’ monsoon with droughts and floods?,"In spite of a seemingly ‘normal’ monsoon this year, some states are braving floods, whereas others are preparing for drought. States like Gujarat are dealing with both the disasters because of high rainfall variation within the state.

The monsoon season has two important variables – spatial, where some areas get plentiful rain and others remain dry; and temporal, with dry spells interspersing wet spells.

The unpredictable nature of the monsoon puts agriculture at risk, with the kharif crop being sowed in June and July.

There is a high chance of 2018 being an El Nino year, but experts are divided about whether the El Nino can affect the Indian summer monsoon.

Two months of the annual southwest monsoon are over, with another two to go. As against a normal rainfall of 452.8 millimetres (mm), the country has received 426.1 mm rainfall, thereby registering a rainfall departure of minus 6 percent till July 31.

As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), if the “percentage departure of realised rainfall is within 10% of the long period average,” it is considered ‘normal’ rainfall. The long period average is calculated on the basis of mean rainfall in the four months of southwest monsoon from 1951 to 2000, and works out to an average of 89 cm for the country as a whole.

In spite of the seemingly ‘normal’ monsoon scenario in the country, some states are braving floods, whereas others are preparing for drought. Interestingly, states such as Gujarat are dealing with both the disasters because of wide spatial variation in rainfall within the state. For instance, Gir Somnath district in Saurashtra has received 128 percent of its normal rainfall till July 31, whereas Gandhinagar district has recorded ‘large deficient’ rainfall of minus 64 percent. Kutch region in the state has minus 75 percent large deficient rainfall, too. Ahmedabad, Surendranagar, Patan and Mehsana districts have deficient rainfall of minus 56 percent, minus 58 percent, minus 52 percent and minus 48 percent, respectively.

Just two weeks ago – in mid-July – several districts in Saurashtra and south Gujarat were braving terrible floods. Villages were cut off and a number of roads, including two national highways and 12 state highways, were closed. Because of continuous heavy rainfall and floods, 52 people lost their lives in Gujarat.

“The recent floods in Gujarat show that deficient rainfall and floods is a matter of scale, and depend on time and space; when it rains and where it rains is important,” said Vimal Mishra, associate professor of civil engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar. “These events of extreme rainfall reflect the changing characteristics of our summer monsoon rainfall,” he added.

When it rains and where it rains

Picture this: Till July 9, Gir Somnath district in Saurashtra had ‘large deficient’ rainfall (ranging between minus 99 percent and minus 60 percent). By July 16, with 83 percent of its normal rainfall, Gir Somnath had jumped to ‘large excess’ rainfall category (rainfall above 60 percent). And, within another day, by July 17, it had received 158 percent of its normal rainfall leading to extreme floods.

Similarly, within a day, between July 17 and July 18, Devbhoomi Dwarka district jumped from ‘large deficient’ rainfall of minus 82 percent to ‘normal’ rainfall category. Porbandar and Jamnagar, which were reporting deficient rainfall of minus 57 percent and minus 38 percent, respectively, also moved to normal rainfall category within a day. Meanwhile, as of July 31, Devbhoomi Dwarka district is back to ‘deficient’ rainfall category with minus 29 percent rainfall departure.

Assam and Manipur in the northeast faced similar situation in the month of June, when both the states were under deficient rainfall category, but were also facing floods. Uttar Pradesh, with minus 20 percent deficient rainfall till July 29, is now braving floods and over 49 people have been killed in the state due to heavy rainfall.

Over 537 people have lost their lives this southwest monsoon season (2018) due to heavy rainfall and floods in six states of the country.

Looking beyond the regular statistics

According to M Rajeevan, secretary, Union Ministry of Earth Sciences, the monsoon season consists of two large modes of variability. “One is spatial mode in which on a given year all the sub-divisions may not get equal amount of rainfall. When central plains get rains well, normally the northeast region receives less rainfall,” he explained. As of July 31, all sub-divisions in the northeast are in deficient rainfall category.

The second variability is on time scale. “We do not receive rainfall on all the days and there are active and break spells… Gujarat is well known for short spells of heavy rainfall, which has implications for water management,” added Rajeevan.

To understand spatial variation in monsoon rainfall and the co-existence of deficient rainfall and floods, it is important to look beyond the regular statistics, said R.R. Kelkar, former director general of IMD. More than the total quantum of rainfall, it is the timing of rainfall that matters. “Disasters such as floods and droughts are not related to the total rainfall, but the timing of the rainfall,” he said.

Recently, a May 2018 study reported that the intensity of monsoon precipitation is changing, which has implications for droughts, floods and groundwater recharge in India. Authors of the study, Mishra and two more researchers, have estimated long-term (1951-2016) changes in total monsoon precipitation, low-intensity precipitation and high-intensity precipitation in the country.

The results show “substantial decline in total precipitation (PPT Total ) and low-intensity precipitation (PPT Low ) across India”. But, within the same time period, the study found high spatial variability in the trends of PPT High [high-intensity precipitation] over India. For instance, high-intensity precipitation has increased in western and peninsular India, and declined in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, finds the study.

“Our analysis shows that low-intensity rainfall is declining in Gujarat and high-intensity rainfall is on the rise in the state. Meanwhile, overall rainfall has declined in the Indo-Gangetic Plain,” said Mishra.

As of July 31, Bihar and Jharkhand have a rainfall departure of minus 23 percent and minus 24 percent, respectively. The Bihar government is already preparing for drought and has announced measures for kharif sowing and diesel subsidy to the farmers. Threat of drought looms large over northeastern states , which are facing deficient rainfall. Manipur has recorded minus 64 percent rainfall departure.

Dry spell ahead?

While parts of Gujarat are braving floods and Bihar is preparing for drought, the multi-modal and multi-ensemble (MME) extended range forecast of IMD is suggesting reduced rainfall and a break in monsoon starting July 27, which may extend till August 23 in some states of the country, such as Maharashtra.

“Yes, from July 27 we expect weakening of monsoon, but for a short period. We should ultimately receive normal rainfall, as we predicted,” said Rajeevan of MoES.

However, Kelkar claims that the terminology of ‘normal’ rainfall is misleading, as it averages out downpour in high-rainfall and low-rainfall areas. “Thus, the country and its various states end up getting ‘normal’ rainfall, which is far removed from the ground realities,” he said.

According to Kelkar, dry spells are a part of the monsoon. “Wet spell cannot sustain for 120 days of the southwest monsoon. After a wet spell, dry spell will come and is normal. What is of concern is the duration of dry spell, which isn’t easy to forecast,” said Kelkar. “An extended dry spell can have bad impacts on the kharif crops,” he added.

In the month of June, a prolonged dry spell delayed kharif (monsoon crop) sowing in several states of the country. Although the sowing has now picked up, it is still seven percent lower than last year. And, the break in monsoon could make things worse.

Yesterday (August 1), Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency, updated its monsoon forecast for this year to 92 percent of long period average, which is below normal rainfall. Earlier this year, the private agency had predicted normal southwest monsoon with 100 percent rainfall of the LPA with no chance of drought in the country.

“If dry spell extends in Marathwada [Maharashtra] till third week of August, then it will badly impact the kharif crops,” said Mohan Gojamgunde, an agricultural officer at Latur in the Marathwada region. “We have 80 percent kharif area under soybean in Latur and Osmanabad districts. A prolonged dry spell, of more than 10 days, will affect soybean growth and flowering, and lead to yield losses,” he added.

El Niño: Is it a concern for India’s southwest monsoon?

Meanwhile, meteorologists across the world are keeping a close watch on El Niño , a complex weather pattern resulting from variations in ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. As per the El Niño Watch , issued on July 12 by the United States-based National Weather Service Climate Prediction Centre and the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, there is “the chance for El Niño increasing to about 65% during fall, and to about 70% during winter 2018-19”.

A large number of scientific studies associate El Niño with a weak southwest monsoon (rainfall below normal) and La Niña with a strong southwest monsoon (rainfall more than normal).

However, experts’ opinion on the impact of El Niño on this year’s southwest monsoon is divided. Whereas a section of meteorologists believe El Niño may impact the latter part of the monsoon [rainfall in September], others claim it is too early to comment on its fallouts.

“Scientists are quick to link El Niño and Madden-Julian Oscillation [MJO] with the southwest monsoon. But forget that our monsoon is a global annual feature and has its own system and its own strengths,” said Kelkar. According to him, there are a number of local factors, such as the Tibetan Plateau, the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal that have more influence on the monsoon than El Niño or MJO. “No one talks about impact of the almost five kilometre tall Tibetan plateau on the southwest monsoon, as it is near impossible to get last 100 years data about the plateau,” he complained.

According to Sridhar Balasubramanian, associate professor of mechanical engineering and an adjunct faculty in IDP Climate Studies at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, the Bay of Bengal plays an important role in the southwest monsoon, which is still not fully understood. “As per our research paper , published in April this year, the inter-annual variability of the Bay of Bengal is very high for a normal monsoon year in comparison to an El Niño year,” he said.

Inter-annual variability of Bay of Bengal refers to its dynamical state each monsoon year, which is extremely crucial for genesis and sustenance of low pressure systems and tropical depressions. Due to the high inter-annual variability during normal monsoon years, the dynamical state of Bay of Bengal every year is very different, thereby causing erratic rainfall pattern across India. However, during El Niño and La Niña years, the variability is low, and hence the dynamical state of the Bay is more or less the same leading to a more consistent rainfall pattern, explained Balasubramanian.

“The fundamental physics behind high inter-annual variability of normal monsoon years is not very well understood and is an ongoing topic of research,” he added.

Scientists have started taking a keen interest in the connections between the Bay of Bengal and summer monsoon intra-seasonal oscillations (MISO). The MISO is a process that occurs several times each year from May to October in the atmosphere over the tropical Indian Ocean, the western tropical Pacific Ocean, and the surrounding land areas. MISO events alternate between periods of wetter-than-average and drier-than-average conditions, a cycle that lasts longer than typical weather systems do (1-2 weeks), but shorter than a season (90 days). MISO, it is believed, come from some kind of powerful atmosphere-ocean interaction.

As part of a five-year study on the relationship between MISO and the Bay of Bengal, known as MISO-BOB (partially funded by the ministry of earth sciences), a group of researchers is already studying the atmosphere-ocean interaction in the Bay of Bengal to unravel mysteries around our monsoon.

While the NDA government has rightly been accused of diluting environmental laws nationwide, in this case, the responsibility lies squarely with the UPA. It was in 2010 that it appointed a committee, headed by the eminent ecologist, Madhav Gadgil, to recommend how to protect the Western Ghats, down the entire coast.

The committee proposed that 1,30,000 sq km of the ghats be designated an ecological-sensitive zone, with varying degrees of protection needed for different areas. This included a ban on special economic zones, conversion of public to private lands and diversion of forest land, new dams and mining licences.

Expectedly, there was a political furore against the committee’s 2011 report, most vehemently from Kerala itself. The UPA caved in and appointed another committee, this time headed by ISRO chief K Kasturirangan, which in 2013 recommended that 60% of the ghats, an area widened to 1,64,000 sq km, would be open for settlements, farming and plantations, and only 30%, or 60,000 sq km would remain “biologically rich”. While some of the earlier bans were retained, construction projects up to 20,000 sq metres were permitted. It was only last year the Union environment ministry notified a slightly smaller ecologically sensitive area.

Such tinkering with what is one of the country’s prized ecological assets, with illegal encroachments and a free rein to builders on the ghat slopes and floodplains below, led to the disastrous landslides and flooding this year. There are an estimated 1,500 illegal crusher and quarrying units in Kerala, which function freely.

Gadgil, who also examined the environmental impact assessment (EIA) reports of Goa’s iron ore companies during his committee’s deliberations, has alleged that it may well be next to face such floods. While its ghats aren’t as high, the rampant illegal mining of iron ore – estimated to have touched Rs 35,000 crore by the Justice MB Shah committee appointed by the Centre – may play similar havoc. The streams in the floodplains don’t find any mention in the EIA reports. Appropriately, a searing book by Hartman de Souza which exposes such rapacity has been titled Eat Dust.

As one travels northwards up the west coast, there is no paucity of examples of similar illiteracy. In 2005, Mumbai faced its “unprecedented” day of rainfall, which led to a surge of the Mithi river, which has becoming a dumping ground , and not just encroached upon but actually bent twice at right angles under the airport. Nature hit back and the airport of the country’s financial capital was closed for a couple of days, as Kochi’s is now.

Blissfully ignorant of these harsh lessons, the Maharashtra government is building the Navi Mumbai airport in the twin city across the harbour by razing hills to the ground and raising the height of the runways by 5.5 metres, since these are on floodplains. As Dutch experts whose advice has gone unheeded point out, it’s a no-brainer that water will inundate the neighbouring villages. Some, a mere 100 metres from the landfilling work, have been flooded for the very first time this June.

The earlier Congress state government should also explain its wisdom in proposing Mumbai’s Rs 15,000-crore coast road, not to mention the Shivaji statue in the sea off Marine Drive, both projects which the BJP coalition is pursuing enthusiastically. While torrential and prolonged downpours are the new normal, their impact will inevitably be accentuated by sea-level rise with climate change, swamping all such grandiose, hare-brained infrastructure schemes.

The monsoon season is a dangerous and unsettling time in India, with most deaths reported from heavy rains and flooding in the four months of rain from June to September.

“Increasing trends in daily extreme precipitation in India have been observed during the recent 46 decades,” a recent paper said. “Moreover, urban areas in India have witnessed 47 eccentric precipitation extremes in the past, which have affected human lives and infrastructure.”

Between 1950 and 2017, India has reported 285 floods that have impacted 850 million people, left 19 million homeless and killed about 71,000. In the past decade, flood damage has led to losses of US $ 3 billion every year, according to the International Disaster Database.

But it is the short bursts of extreme precipitation that has scientists worried. Such events may boost the total amount of rainfall but they do not necessarily reduce water stress or significantly recharge the water table. On the contrary, much of the rain discharge is difficult to manage and often causes flash floods, which is detrimental to infrastructure.

Incidences of extreme rainfall, that precipitates flooding, are projected to increase as the planet warms. India is not just highly prone to weather-related disasters, its high population density and poor infrastructure also puts its people at higher risk. In the last two years alone, 25 million people have suffered impacts from heavy rains and floods and at least 2,000 people have died in these episodes.

In India, both large-scale floods from continuous heavy downpours and flash floods from sudden bursts of rain are expected to strike more often.

“A warming climate will cause more intense and more frequent extreme rain events,” Vimal Mishra, a climate scientist at IIT Gandhinagar, said. The increase in rainfall extremes is being driven by anthropogenic warming, Mishra and his colleagues said in a 2018 paper, noting that in the worst case scenario of unchecked greenhouse gas emissions, such events will increase significantly over south and central India by 2050.

“For cities, daily rainfall data is not that helpful, even 5-10 minutes of heavy rain can flood a city and pose a risk to the infrastructure,” Mishra said. Which is why the scientist is calling for improving understanding of sub-daily rainfall patterns that include rainfall spurts over less than 24 hours.”There isn’t enough focus on sub-daily rainfall events,” he said.

A paper by Mishra and his team showed that such short duration rainfall events that can trigger flash floods are even more sensitive to warming temperatures than 24-hour rainfall extremes. If there is an increase in average temperatures of 1 degree Celsius, there would be a greater increase in the events of sub-daily rainfall extremes than daily extremes.

The researchers found that the frequency of such events would increase by 20% if global temperature rises by 1.5 degrees Celsius and by 25% if they increase by 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial level.

Other researchers have reached similar conclusions about widespread extreme rains that causes flooding.

“We looked at the entire country and found a threefold increase in widespread extreme rain events over central India,” Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, said. “Barring a few pockets of the country, the country overall is likely to see an increase in such events.”

Widespread rainfall events that occur over multiple days and cover a large swathe of area (running into thousands of square kms) are known to cause large-scale floods. The 2005 Maharashtra flood on July 26 and July 27, which led to over 1,000 deaths across the state and brought Mumbai to a standstill, is an example of this.

When temperature increases, it raises the moisture-holding capacity of the atmosphere. Scientists have reported an increase in moisture content in the atmosphere over the Indian subcontinent.

While this may sound like good news, the distribution of the rain over space and time muddies such a straightforward understanding. More rain is not a blessing when it is dumped over short periods of time.

It’s not just local warming, but region-wide warming is having an impact on India’s rainfall patterns, according to Koll.

“It is not the local temperatures, warming that is not even exactly over the Indian subcontinent has resulted in more moisture availability,” he explained. “ It is coming from the Arabian Sea, so warming elsewhere will also impact extreme rainfall events over Indian subcontinent.”

286,286,mumbai,2018,https://e360.yale.edu/features/dying-waters-india-struggles-to-clean-up-its-polluted-urban-rivers,15 Feb 2018,Dying Waters: India Struggles to Clean Up Its Polluted Urban Rivers,"India’s booming population and rapidly expanding urban areas have exacted a huge toll on its rivers, which are badly polluted and choked by development. But in cities across India, activists are heading to court to force municipalities and states to take action.

Standing on a small concrete bridge, environmental activist Janak Daftary gestures toward the crowded banks of the Mithi River, which runs through the heart of Mumbai. On one side are garages with heaps of car parts that slope into the river, bleeding paint, metals, and oil into the Mithi, a mere 120 feet wide at this point. On the other side are shanties made of brick, tin, and plastic; metal scrap dealers; and a middle-class housing complex flanked by concrete walls that plunge into the water. Below the bridge, a dark slurry with floating bits of plastic, cloth, and rubber slowly passes downstream, toward the office buildings and construction cranes of Mumbai’s new financial district. “This is how you kill a river,” says Daftary, an engineer who works with Jal Biradari, a water conservation group. Along with Vanashakti, a Mumbai-based environmental organization, Daftary’s NGO prevailed in a case in India’s Supreme Court last August involving the restoration of the Mithi. The top court reprimanded the local authorities for their neglect and directed independent experts to assess measures taken to date and recommend additional remedies to reverse the degradation of the Mithi. India has seen a string of such judicial rulings involving urban rivers in recent years, as the country comes to grips with the widespread pollution that has fouled waterways and with runaway development that has destroyed or damaged wetlands and floodplains. Across major cities, environmentalists and citizens are engaged in prolonged, seemingly intractable battles to clean up local rivers - mainly through legal petitions intended to force authorities to take action or, in some cases, to stop them taking damaging measures, such as constructing concrete flood walls that hem in the river. Some of these battles have been triggered by recent floods and made more urgent by projections of increased extreme rain events and other climate risks.

The sacred Ganges has been at the center of a legal battle focused on the failure of a government plan to clean up the river.

In the technology hub of Hyderabad, activists went to the National Green Tribunal, a quasi-judicial authority, in 2015 to prevent illegal construction near the city’s Musi River. In Chennai, in South India, citizens have petitioned the tribunal to stop pollution of the Cooum River, as well as to ensure proper dredging of a large canal to remove silt and improve flow. In New Delhi, activists have been fighting one legal case after another over the years to keep the floodplain and river bed of the Yamuna, a major tributary of the Ganges, free of myriad developments, including a subway depot and road. And the sacred Ganges, which runs through five Indian states, has been at the center of a legal battle by environmentalists and citizens frustrated by the failure of a government plan to clean up the badly contaminated river. Rivers and streams have borne the brunt of the recent urban explosion in India, a nation whose population has nearly doubled in the last 40 years to 1.35 billion. Unplanned growth has led to the use of water bodies as dumping grounds for sewage and industrial effluent. According to India’s Central Pollution Control Board, 63 percent of the urban sewage flowing into rivers (some 62 billion liters a day) is untreated. In addition, riverbanks, wetlands, and floodplains have been claimed over time by infrastructure, slums, offices, and housing developments - all of which has narrowed natural river channels and distorted flow, greatly reducing the ability of India’s rivers to buffer flooding. It also has taken a toll on biodiversity.

The cost of this abuse has mounted over the years. A study last year linked increasing cases of typhoid, hepatitis, and diarrhea in New Delhi to severe pollution in the Yamuna River, which provides much of the city’s drinking water.

Environmentalists blame the failure of past cleanup efforts on a host of problems: The political clout of industries, contractor-driven boondoggles, weak enforcement by pollution-control agencies, and clashing government departments. The $3 billion initiative to clean up the Ganges, a flagship project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, must navigate the politics of five states, numerous cities, and multiple central government agencies. Renowned hydrologist Madhav Chitale resigned from the main Ganges cleanup initiative last year partly because, he said, “some people [in the mission] are focused on religious and cultural issues rather than on the technical remedies.” He and others point to the Sabarmati River in Gujarat, Modi’s home state, as an example of sound urban river restoration. For decades, the Sabarmati - which runs through the state capital of Ahmedabad - was just another dirty, seasonally dry river. Then architects gave it a makeover, clearing out the slums along its banks and creating a channel of clear water bordered by a long concrete waterfront. The creation of attractive riverfronts is seen by many as key to mobilizing public support for conservation. But some have criticized the Sabarmati project for focusing on beautification rather than ecological restoration. Water was brought from another river to keep the channel full, and pollution has simply been pushed downstream, said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers & People, a conservation group. “We don’t have a success story yet,” he said. The cost of the damage to India’s rivers was made painfully clear in December 2015, when Chennai experienced severe rainfall that overwhelmed its river and canal network. The region’s small rivers had been extensively manipulated over the years and had lost their floodplains to urban development, says Jayshree Vencatesan, managing trustee of Care Earth Trust. “Unless their flow is managed as a grid, they cannot perform their ecosystem services,” said Vencatesan.

For much of its run, Mumbai’s Mithi River is a glorified sewer serving small workshops, slums, housing developments, and a business center.

The Chennai floods took nearly 300 lives, damaged thousands of homes and businesses, and paralyzed the airport, which is partly built over the Adyar River, all leading to an estimated $3 billion in losses to the city’s economy. The flood brought attention to the assault on the region’s natural systems, with marshland shrinking by 45 square miles from 1980 to 2010, according to a study by Care Earth Trust. The disaster provided new impetus to long-pending cleanup plans for the Cooum River, which had languished for decades. Last year the official Chennai Rivers Restoration Trust obtained environmental clearances for a major restoration project.

A similar disaster unfolded in Mumbai on July 26, 2005 when an unprecedented monsoon deluge drowned the financial capital, killing more than 900 people, damaging a quarter-million homes, and causing an estimated $2 billion in economic losses. This inundation made Mumbai residents suddenly aware of the presence of the Mithi River in their midst. A modest channel that begins in suburban hills, the Mithi winds 11 miles down to the Arabian Sea. For much of its run, the river is a glorified sewer serving small workshops, slums, housing, the airport, and a business center. All were inundated on that fateful day when the conjunction of high tide and extreme rain caused the river to overflow its banks and flood the city.

Since then, multiple studies have decried the systematic destruction of the Mithi, pointing to a host of assaults: The airport’s runway had been built over the river, narrowing the channel and forcing it into a 90-degree bend, and a new office district had been built on wetlands. One satellite study found that from 1966 to 2005 the width of the Mithi was reduced by almost 50 percent, while mudflats had shrunk by 70 percent. The experts proposed solutions: close polluting businesses and industries, collect garbage, install sewage plants, restore the banks, dredge the river, create a buffer zone, and nurture the mangroves to absorb future floods. Last August, intense rainfall came perilously close to causing another major flood in Mumbai. That same month, the Indian Supreme Court condemned the lack of progress in restoring the Mithi following the 2005 floods. Despite much expenditure, the river is still filthy and continualy encroached upon, most recently by the dumping of debris from construction of a new subway. Municipal authorities have been slow to set up sewage treatment plants, and the few treatment projects underway don’t hew to expert recommendations. The National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) and the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay had called for setting up as many as 37 small sewage plants along the river, rather than a few large ones - a recommendation the city has so far ignored. “The model from developed countries in which all sewage is taken and treated in one place appears to be impossible here because planning is always far behind population growth,” said NEERI director Rakesh Kumar. In this context, he said, a decentralized approach might work better. Mumbai has taken some steps in recent years, mainly for flood prevention. Municipal authorities have spent S100 million dredging and widening the river at its narrowest points, and the regional planning agency, which controls the last 3.7 miles of the river, has spent millions more removing silt, demolishing encroaching structures, and resettling hundreds of slum dwellers.

The Mithi’s crowded banks point to the social challenges of these cleanup efforts, especially in a city where half the population lives in slums.

But the Mithi’s crowded banks point to the social challenges of these cleanup efforts, especially in a city where half the population lives in slums. Relocating slum dwellers and industries takes time - land must be found, consent obtained, people and businesses shifted. Often people are forced out and homes demolished willy-nilly, as has happened on Chennai’s riverbanks. Rehabilitation sites are usually far away, disrupting community and employment networks. In the neighborhood of Kalina, along the Mithi, residents are furious about having to possibly move to a resettlement complex near polluting oil refineries. Such action seems especially unjust since entities such as the airport and the financial complex have expanded into the river’s flood plain, and they are not being told to leave. “If everyone is to blame, why target the slums?” asked Fayzah Khan, a local resident.",discussion,Mumbai floods,"Mumbai, India","July 26, 2005","July 27, 2005",Mumbai,"1,000 mm",$2 billion,900,"Floodwaters inundated the city, killing more than 900 people, damaging a quarter-million homes, and causing an estimated $2 billion in economic losses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Mumbai: According to a study done by RMSI, a leading risk management consultancy that works with major government agencies, revealed that the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), Thane, Bhiwandi and Antop Hill are among the areas which are at a high risk from extreme floods. The study also shows areas near creeks and areas surrounding rivers can expectedly be flooded after heavy Mumbai rains.

Areas like Kalina, Sahar Road, BKC, and Dharavi all are along the Mithi River and these areas were also inundated during 2005 floods. During 2005 floods, the commercial capital received 944 mm of rain in just one day.

According to a report by the Times of India, Mumbai ranks 8th among cities most exposed to storm risk across the world, as per the 2014 report by Global Reinsurer Swiss Re and climate is acting as a catalyst in this problem. Between 1950 and 2015 across Central India including Mumbai there has been a three-fold increase in extreme rainfall events. Other high flood risk areas were identified as Thane, Mumbra, Kalwa, and Bhiwandi along the Ulhas river and Thane Creek.

Among other Indian cities - Delhi, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Allahabad, Kochi and Bengaluru also have a high risk of getting flooded. According to a report by the Times of India, Pushpendra Johari, head of risk and insurance at RMSI notes that the low-lying areas in island city are more influenced with high tide events. Water in these areas drain out easily into the sea, but in areas farther inland, the water won’t go anywhere for a long time.

Moreover, the study notes new constructions and businesses which are coming up in Thane and Bhiwandi. Subsequently, exposure of people and assets to natural hazards in these areas has increased considerably.

Former chief planner of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, V K Pathak, pointed out that the government has not yet undertaken any comprehensive flood risk assessment of the region, such a study is needed.

Splurge and save now! Click here

While rainfall exceeding 100mm in an hour — a phenomena largely associated with cloud conditions in the Himalayan region and which leads to flash floods — has already been categorised as cloud burst events, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), so far there have been no categories to define intense, but short bursts of rain.

Now, based on the concept of the 1999 study, a four-member team from Pune’s Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), which is under the

Ministry of Earth Sciences, and Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi has defined MCB as short-term but intense rainfall events characterised by 50mm rain or more in two consecutive hours.

The IITM team also redefined cloud bursts as CBa (associated with high topography), CBb (more than 100mm in an hour), and MCB (more than 50mm in two consecutive hours).

At present, rainfall of 50mm and above in two consecutive hours does not fall under the category of a cloud burst (CBb) even though the floods and damage it causes is similar.

The team’s findings assume significance because MCB events cause urban flooding in a city like Mumbai, and lead to loss of life and damage to property. The scientists also described the incessant downpour of September 20, 2017 — 304mm in just a day over Mumbai that grounded country’s financial capital — as a combination of MCB and CBb events.

The researchers said the rate of accumulation of water during a mini-cloud burst is three times more than in an extreme rainfall event — which the IMD calculates as 200mm in 24 hours — with three times more probability of flash floods.

Independent experts said the prediction of MCBs can also be used to find solutions to flooding during flash floods.

“The work by the IITM scientists provides important insights on cloud burst and mini-cloud burst events that can cause flash flooding in the mountains and cities,” said Vimal Mishra, an associate professor, civil engineering, in the Indian Institute of Technology- Gandhinagar, who was not involved in the study. “The next step can be to find what the major driving factors of such events are, that cause loss of lives and infrastructure. In the future, the predictability of these events of such a short duration (1-2 hours) can be evaluated. This is essential to reduce damage.”

“Along the west coast, MCB events occur when there is a combination of a strong offshore trough (elongated region of relatively low atmospheric pressure that affects weather) from south Gujarat to the Kerala coast, along with other weather systems from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal,” said Nayana Deshpande, principal investigator, IITM. “Anthropogenic changes increase the severity of such rainfall events. As the existence of such events remains unclear in the meteorological community, we coined the term mini-cloud burst.”

An analysis of hourly rainfall data between 1969 and 2015 across 126 rain gauges has revealed that on an average, India records 200 MCB events a year, with the highest (around 265 MCBs) in 1988 and 2007. India has recorded 28 CBb events during the study period. Trend analysis also indicated that MCB events are likely to increase in the future with cities such as Mumbai witnessing an average of five or more MCB events every monsoon, Kolkata recording between three and five MCB events, and Delhi likely to record an average of one to two MCB events.

The study also found that MCB occurs over the Western Ghats in June; over central India and the foot hills of the Himalayas in July and August. The frequency is low in the month of September. These short duration heavy spells, researchers said, generally take place during the morning hours (midnight to noon) at the foot hills of the Himalayas, and along the west coast of India — which includes Mumbai. MCBs in central India occur in the afternoon (noon to 6pm), and in south India, at night (6pm to midnight).

Statistical analysis also showed that the intensity of MCB events in the Himalayan foothills, west coast, and Western Ghats increased after 1991, but has decreased in the northeast. Deshpande said IITM researchers will share their findings with the India Meteorological Department, which is the official weather forecaster for the country.

The study ‘Statistical characteristics of cloud burst and mini-cloud burst events during monsoon season in India’ was published in the International Journal of Climatology, a peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, this month.

rescued throughand human chains;brought in from Andheri and Mumbai Central WR canteens.Current bane of Mumbai’s railway network, tracks in Nalasopara went 600 mm under water on Tuesday; this was at least 300 mm more than Monday, when monsoon returned in full fury. The authorities blame the flooding on rainwater flowing unhindered from theto the city. Over the years, road levels have gone up, creating a saucer effect around the tracks of Nalasopara, which therefore get flooded during the rains. Nalasopara received around 320 mm of rainfall between Monday midnight and 8.00 am on Tuesday.On Tuesday morning, 4.00 am, Vadodara Express was the first train that stopped short of entering Nalasopara station, leaving over 1,000 passengers stranded on the inter-city train. Twelve hours later, the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) had to bring in tube boats to ferry senior passengers to the station; for others,were used. Throughout the day on Tuesday, the water level did not recede, which meant that trains were only available from Churchgate to Bhayander.Joel George and his family of 12 were stuck on Vadodara Express for 12 hours before being brought to the platform at 4.00 pm by the NDRF team. “Fearing short circuit, the power was cut. That made staying inside AC coaches very difficult. Local youngsters tried sending us lunch at around 1.00 pm through ropes,” he said.Though Shatabdi Express passengers had ground under their feet – the train was stuck at a Nalasopara platform – they had nowhere to go as the streets outside were knee-deep under water. It was then that Western railway (WR) tied up with MSRTC andto arrange for trucks and buses to ferry these passengers to Naigaon railway station, from where alternate mode of transport was provided. What’s more, WR engaged its canteens in Andheri and Mumbai Central to cook for stranded passengers; food packets were transported through locals up to Vasai and then via road to Nalasopara.On the CR line, flooding was reported in Mankhurd, Sandhurst Road, Byculla, Thane, Kalwa, Kurla and Matunga. Bunching of trains was reported between Sion and Dadar, where passengers took over two hours to cover a distance of 10 minutes. At Sandhurst Road, a signal failure further slowed down services. On Tuesday, 150 WR services were cancelled, even as CR witnessed 130 cancellations.

This is the worst flooding since 2005 when, in 24 hours to 8.30am on July 27, 2005, in its worst ever flooding, Mumbai witnessed 944mm of rain, with more than 500 people dying in that flood.

The rain came down in Mumbai much as it had in Chandigarh on the morning of August 21, 2017. By afternoon, the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana had received 112 mm of rainfall, 23 times the city’s average daily monsoon rainfall. Similarly, on August 15, Bengaluru received 37 times, and on August 11-12 Agartala received more than 11 times its average daily monsoon rainfall of the last five years.

In Chandigarh, a city of 1 million, commuters found it difficult to reach their destinations, and some had to abandon their cars and motorbikes on the roads. Many vehicles floated in the water–a reminder of similar images from Chennai during the November-December 2015 floods. Water entered buildings, and the urban administration of the country’s best-planned city descended into chaos.

Independence Day 2017 was unusually wet and waterlogged for Bengaluru. Heavy rains started around midnight, and by morning, 128 mm of rain had cascaded down on the city of 9 million. Localities in and around Koramangala in the southern part of the city went under water, with parked vehicles nearly submerging.

On August 11 and 12, 2017, a heavy downpour drowned Agartala, the capital of Tripura in northeastern India. While the city of 438,000 received 102 mm of rainfall in one day, on the next there was 94 mm, and 196 mm in two days was more than the city could take. The city’s systems collapsed, and normal life was disrupted.

On July 26-27, 2017, the downpour was in Ahmedabad, where within 24 hours the city of 5.5 million received 200 mm of rainfall. To make matters worse, due to heavy rainfall in the upper part of the Sabarmati river catchment, the authorities had to release water from the Dharoi dam. With the river hemmed in by perpendicular, concrete riverbanks as it flowed through Ahmedabad, there were serious threats of heavy flooding, and the administration reportedly evacuated more than 10,000 people.

In the monsoon months of July to September, between 2012 and 2016, Mumbai’s suburban district received an average rainfall of 18.54 mm. As we said, Mumbai received more than 11 times this amount in under 12 hours on August 29, 2017.

With such cloudbursts becoming more frequent across India, these are the questions scientists are considering: Is the prognosis of extreme weather events becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change beginning to come true? Are Indian cities designed to withstand such events? What can be done to make them more resilient?

Increased rainfall intensity in a time of climate change

Recent research indicates that the intensity of these extreme weather events is increasing, according to Pradeep Mujumdar, chairman, Interdisciplinary Centre for Water Research (ICWaR) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. Also, the intensity of urban events vis-à-vis non-urban ones is increasing.

“Though it is difficult to attribute any one event to climate change, there is much research results from across the world that is showing that the pattern of multiple extreme events in a season is happening due to the changing climate,” Mujumdar told indiaclimatedialogue.net, a website dedicated to climate-change reportage.

Chennai had a series of five “extreme precipitation events”, in scientific parlance, between November 8 and December 4, 2015. Before the city could recover from one event, it was battered by the next. The climax was the release of water from the Chembarambakkam reservoir upstream of the city, causing the Adayar river to jump its banks in Chennai.

The secondary runway of the Chennai airport, built over the Adayar river, was flooded and airport services were paralysed for days. To evacuate those who wanted to leave the city and were stuck at the airport, the Indian Navy helped operate civilian flights from the naval air base at nearby Arkonam.

ICWaR has been studying the urban flooding events in Chennai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru in recent years. For Bengaluru, the team compared 26 general circulation models (or global climate models) along four “representative concentration pathways”–greenhouse gas emission scenarios up to year 2100, used by the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The conclusion: Climate change projections clearly indicate an increase in high-intensity rainfall.

Another report, published by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bengaluru, confirms similar findings: Rain events greater than 100 mm have increased in number in the past 100 years, researchers Jagdish Krishnaswamy and Srinivasan Vaidyanathan wrote. There is an overall increasing trend of events exceeding 100, 150 and 200 mm since the 1900s. But there is an increasing variability in recent decades.

However, attributing a single event to climate change remains problematic.

It was not possible to attribute the extreme rainfall in Chennai on December 1, 2015, to climate change, a team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, and the University of Oxford in the UK, said in a 2016 study.

Taken by surprise, cities struggle to predict rainfall intensity and its impact

It is this variability in rainfall that takes cities by surprise. Professional weather watchers of the India Meteorological Department and private individuals and agencies are able to say that it is going to rain over a particular city, but they cannot foresee its intensity and impact.

To improve prediction, global climate models developed by the IPCC need to be reconstructed for cities, said scientists.

Due to their higher population density, cities are vulnerable to greater loss of life and property than rural areas. Chennai, for instance, has a population density of 26,553 people per sq km.

Extreme rainfall also leaves cities at greater economic risk. The economic loss to Chennai from the flood of 2015 was estimated to be $3.5 billion (Rs 21,381 crore), according to annual estimates compiled by global reinsurance major Munich Re.

If extreme rainfall events become more frequent, cities need to be prepared for extreme flooding. They do not appear to be.

Why cities are not prepared for extreme rainfall

In Bengaluru, storm water networks are either blocked or not adequate, according to Veena Srinivasan, fellow at ATREE. Many of these drains also carry sewage, which should be separated and treated. With sewage mixing with stormwater, it is difficult to channel the excess rain water into local lakes.

Garbage also finds its way into and obstructs stormwater drains, floating out when they overflow.

Changing urban land use disallows water from soaking into the ground. “In normal grounds outside the city, nearly 80% of the rain is absorbed,” G K Bhat, chairman of Ahmedabad-based Taru Leading Edge, a development think tank, told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “Today, with concrete and tarmac all around, we are creating almost a near-total impervious area. Thus, the flood gets amplified in urban areas because of change in land use.”

While the July 2017 flood in Ahmedabad was not the most severe in the city’s history, it had a greater impact than in the past because of growing concretisation of open land.

In Chennai, the release of water from the Chembarambakkam reservoir upstream of the Adayar river on December 1, 2015, was thought to have triggered floods along the river. However, later studies proved that the reservoir water only added to water flowing in from the southwestern suburbs of the city beyond Tambaram.

“The main flow in the Adayar river was coming from these suburbs, and the Chembarambakkam flow only added to this,” Balaji Narasimhan, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “In future, when these suburbs have more buildings and roads, the amplification of the flood could be even higher.”

Existing infrastructure is inadequate and prone to collapse

With the exception of planned cities, such as Chandigarh, and industrial townships, such as Bhilai and Jamshedpur, most Indian cities grow organically from a cluster of villages and small towns. Cities grow without adequate infrastructure, and whatever exists is inadequate for extreme rainfall.

“The existing infrastructure collapses quickly because it is designed for minor floods and not the kind of extreme events that we are seeing in the recent years,” said Bhat. “Even though guidelines have been laid out by the National Disaster Management Authority, urban planners and managers go for designs calibrated for milder events to reduce cost.”

Ironically, when Chennai flooded in 2015, it was the stormwater infrastructure laid down by the British more than a century ago in the older parts of the city that withstood the brunt better than drains installed in the newer parts of the city.

Without redesigning their infrastructure and preparing for extreme weather, India’s cities will increasingly succumb to its ravages.

Incessant rain in Mumbai over the last two days has brought back memories of the record-breaking July 26, 2005, downpour that had paralysed the city. Tuesday’s rain was not, however, triggered by any unusual event, nor was the amount of rainfall anywhere near the July 2005 mark. The Santacruz observatory recorded 315.8 mm of rainfall between 8:30 am and 8:30 pm Tuesday, which was a third of the 944 mm that some parts of the city had received on that 2005 day. Colaba and Thane stations recorded less rainfall than Santacruz.

“Parts of Mumbai get inundated with even 50 mm of rainfall. And in the last two days the city has received over 350 mm rains. These rains were forecast well in advance. No special event has triggered it. And it is not very unusual for Mumbai. It has received more rains in the past.

What happened in Mumbai on August 29 was criminal. Thirty centimetres of rainfall in a day drowned a city celebrated as India’s financial capital and with a civic body with a budget larger than many small states. Lakhs of people were stranded at railway stations or their workplaces or spent the night wading home through flooded roads. As the sun rose heralding a new day, it brought to light fresh horror. Scores of people, most of them aged men and women, were missing. One man seems to have fallen into an open manhole and drowned. His umbrella was found floating nearby.

2. Why floods are the new normal this monsoon Sunita Narain

The Indian monsoon is never really ‘normal’. It rains too much or too little. It is variable and more than often unpredictable.This year, even as 40% of the districts in India face prospects of drought, close to 25% districts have had heavy rainfall of more than 100 mm in just a matter of hours. This means we must learn more about how to mitigate floods and how to live with scarcity of water. But the good news is that doing one can help the other.

3. Why Chandigarh, India’s best planned city, went under after three hours of rain Ramesh Vinayak

Natural mishaps have an uncanny way to expose all that is wrong with India’s urban planning and infrastructure. The unusually heavy rains on August 21 – the heaviest in 16 years – starkly did that reality check at an unlikeliest of places: Chandigarh, the country’s first and, arguably the most, well-planned city since Independence. A 115-mm downpour in just three hours morphed the much-acclaimed ‘City Beautiful’ into an ugly chaos that its denizens had scarcely ever imagined.

4. Why Chennai - like other Indian cities - will definitely flood again Nityanand Jayaraman

What Chennai does to the Kosasthalaiyar river and the Ennore Creek will decide whether the city will survive or succumb with the next above-average rains.Mumbai went under water last week; Chandigarh the week before, and Agartala, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad earlier on during this southwest monsoon. The jury is out on whether the extreme rain events were caused by climate change. But there is little doubt that detrimental land-use change played a big part in turning the rains to floods. Heavy, erratic and extreme rainfall is now unavoidable. But what are we doing to protect ourselves and make our cities less flood prone?

5. Why India is failing to minimise monsoon flood destruction Kumkum Dasgupta

In India, floods are a common occurrence every monsoon. This year the situation is dire in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Assam, Bengal and Manipur. According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), on an average every year, 75 lakh hectare of land is affected, 1,600 lives are lost and the damage caused to crops, houses and public utilities due to floods is worth Rs 1,805 crore. To date, the maximum number of lives (11,316) was lost in 1977. The frequency of major floods is more than once in five years.

The streets of India’s financial capital are her home and have been for the past 50 years. She and her son, his wife and their one-year-old twins have endured the challenges of seasonal rain and scorching summer heat for decades, but this downpour was a fresh nightmare.

“We have been sitting and sleeping on these steps, because they are a bit higher up, for days now,” said Rajput, as her daughter sat behind her picking lice out of her hair. “We can’t cook, there is no clean drinking water. The water was up to our waist. Not a single thing was dry. The rich are OK, but we’re out here with nothing.”



Devastating rainfall across South Asia has led to the deaths of more than 1,200 people and directly affected more than 40 million people in northern India, southern Nepal, northern Bangladesh and southern Pakistan.

About 60% of Mumbai’s 20 million residents live in slums, which gives the city its nickname “Slumbai”. The 2011 Indian census put the number of homeless people in Mumbai at just over 57,000, but local activists say it is more like 150,000-300,000.

As the flood waters began to ebb on Friday, the impact of the disaster on rich and poor people alike was beginning to emerge.

Rescuers worked overnight to pull 12 survivors from the rubble of a building that collapsed on Thursday in the densely populated area of Bhendi Bazaar, killing 34 people.

The 117-year-old, six-storey building had been declared unsafe by the housing regulator in 2011, but many people continued living there. A 20-day-old baby was reported to be among the dead.

Dr Deepak Amarapurkar, 59, a senior gastroenterologist at Bombay hospital, was also among the victims of the extreme weather. He had decided to walk the 10-minute journey through the flooded roads on Tuesday to his home, despite his colleagues advising him to wait until the waters had receded.

On the way, he fell into an open manhole. Onlookers tried to pull him out, but were only able to retrieve his umbrella. Locals said they had removed the manhole lid to help the water level go down. His body later washed up on the shore at Worli, nearly 2.5 miles (4km) away.



With little government help available, some stranded Mumbaiites turned to social media to connect with people willing to put them up for the night.

Mehul Ved, a software professional, created a spreadsheet listing those offering assistance. By Thursday, it contained the names of 6,500 people prepared to help strangers with food, shelter and a change of clothes.



But for those living on the streets, there were no offers of shelter, said Brijesh Arya, the founder of Pehchan, an organisation that supports Mumbai’s homeless families. He said the community kitchens, government help, and shelter provided by churches, temples and some shopkeepers, were reserved for better-off residents.



“The homeless got nothing,” said Arya. “They stayed in the same wet clothes for days. The rains have devastated this vulnerable community. I can’t forget the words of one woman who said to me ‘Just bring me poison will you, I want to die,’ because she couldn’t cope.”

That woman was Savita Kharve, 45, who was born on the streets of Mumbai and lives with her family on the pavement near Mumbai Central railway station. When Arya visited her, he found “horrible” conditions. “No one was eating. The kids are now all sick with runny noses and coughs,” he said.



The Kharves were huddled together under plastic tarpaulin sheets, strengthened with sticks of bamboo, as makeshift protection from the monsoon rain. Gathered around them were survival essentials: a cooking stove, old clothes, second-hand toys and piles of flowers they continued to prepare to sell as soon as the rain subsided.



In a video recorded on Wednesday in the middle of a storm, Kharve told Arya that she and her children had not eaten since the flooding began. With knee-high water, there was nowhere for them to squat and chop vegetables or put down a cooking stove.



Most of the homeless families are daily-wage workers who buy food each day, a task that became impossible during the storm.

“The children went hungry,” said Kharve. “Look around you, there is nothing but water, but who cares about us? Who cares about poor people like me? We are drenched.

“I have no dry clothes. We are just standing here in the rain with nothing,” she said, pointing to her few belongings strewn on the wet and muddy pavement.



Many women and children tried to take refuge under shop awnings or in doorways, but were shooed away. “Where are they supposed to go?” asked Arya. “There are no shelters in the city and there is nowhere for them to escape to.”",flood,2022 Mumbai Floods,"Mumbai, India",26 July 2022,29 July 2022,"Mumbai, India",340 mm,$10 billion,100+,40 million people directly affected,"The floods were caused by torrential rain that fell over Mumbai and surrounding areas.

A 117-year-old apartment building collapsed Thursday in Mumbai, India, killing at least 32 people after days of heavy rains in the city. Officials say at least 15 people were injured when the building caved in in the city’s busy Behendi Bazaar area. A nursery school in the building had not yet opened for the day.

Rescuers pulled several people from the rubble. A police official told reporters nine families had been living in the building.

Heavy rain to ease

Monsoons have flooded India’s commercial capital this week, but forecasters say the heavy rain is expected to ease Friday.

Torrential rains brought the city to a halt Tuesday, making roads impassable and briefly shutting the suburban rail network used by millions of commuters. Thousands were stranded in their offices overnight.

“A journey that usually takes 1 hour, 20 minutes took eight hours that day,” Smriti Verma Anand, a resident of West Bombay, told VOA over a messaging application. “Everywhere there was chaos.”

Throughout the week, Mumbai residents safe in their homes tweeted their locations, often adding whether they had movies or food, offering their homes to anyone stuck in the floods nearby.

“Roadside shops started distributing tea and biscuits and water to people. All the gurdwaras, mandirs and places of worship were opened for people stranded on the road. Common people threw open their doors for anyone and everyone,” Anand said.

Photos and videos showed cars submerged in water and people wading in waist-deep water around the city. Residents of Dharavi, one of the continent’s biggest slums and home to more than a million people, said much of the area was under water.

A number of flights were forced to divert to other cities this week because the Mumbai airport flooded.

Nearby nations also hit hard

India’s neighbors have also been hit by the monsoon season, which began in June and has affected more than 40 million people.

Karachi, Pakistan, saw heavy rain Thursday, and storms were expected across the country for several days.

Bangladesh and Nepal have also experienced severe flooding that forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.

The city of Mumbai struggles each year to plan for and cope with annual rains during monsoon season, which runs from June through September.

On that day 12 years ago, when Mumbai had received a record 944 mm of rain, Mascarenhas’ home in Bandra East’s Middle Income Group Colony was submerged in six feet of water for two days, and her family lost almost all their belongings.

Tuesday’s downpour was the second-heaviest recorded rainfall in the city since then, and once again, citizens were left stranded. Local trains were out of service for most of the day, traffic barely moved on water-logged roads and highways, a building collapsed, desperate citizens struggled to wade home and residents opened up their homes to offer food and shelter to strangers in need. At least five people have died and seven have been reported missing after the deluge.

For Mascarenhas, who works as a cook and lives in a ground-floor room close to the Mithi river, the similarity of Tuesday’s flood with the July 2005 flood lay in the smaller details.

“Our house had filled up with two-and-a-half feet of water and while we were draining it out with buckets, my daughter saw a small snake in the water,” said Mascarenhas, 50, who lives with her husband, a rickshaw driver, and her college-going daughter. “We were terrified because it felt just like 2005, when we found fish swimming in the water that filled our house.”

Fortunately for Mascarenhas and the rest of Mumbai, the flood of August 29 was not, objectively, as severe as the flood of July 26, 2005. Water-logging receded in most parts of the city by late Tuesday night, train services resumed and despite forecasts of heavy rain and possible flooding for the next two days, the city was able to crawl back to normalcy on Wednesday.

Like 2005, however, the group that suffered most acutely on August 29 was the one that got the least visibility in the media and on social media: the residents of Mumbai’s working-class neighbourhoods and slums. For some, the experience of Tuesday’s flood actually turned out to be worse.

Ida Mascarenhas had to dump all her belongings on her bed and on high shelves as her house filled up with 2.5 feet of water. Photo credit: Aarefa Johari.

‘Water was seeping through the walls’

“This was the worst flood I have ever seen here, and I have been living in this slum for 35 years,” said Pushpa Davne, a 60-year-old housewife from Janseva Rahivasi Sangh, a slum in a low-lying neighbourhood in Mahim.

At 11 am on Tuesday, Davne’s slum began to fill up with water that didn’t recede for the next 15 hours. Davne spent most of the day standing in waist-high water, while her husband – a cancer patient with an amputated left leg – had no option but to sit at the edge of the bed and wait.

“In 2005 the water-logging was barely ankle-deep, but this time everything from our clothes to our stored grains and vegetables have been drenched in dirty flood water,” said Atmaram Davne, Pushpa’s husband and a former fisherman.

Further down the lane in the same slum, Nilesh Vaidya’s family also experienced similar problems. “Our refrigerator has stopped working because it got flooded with one foot of water in the night,” said Vaidya, a college student who, like all other residents of the slum, spent most of Wednesday scrubbing and disinfecting his house after salvaging what he could from their clothes and other belongings.

In Ramgad, a Mahim slum right on the edge of the Mithi river, some residents were unable to keep their belongings dry even after piling them up on higher shelves. “It was raining so heavily in the evening that water began to seep through the walls,” said Priyanka Shastri, a housewife whose husband, an Ola driver, was stranded in Dadar for most of the day.

No gutters cleaned

Ironically, even though Shastri’s slum is on the banks of the river Mithi, it wasn’t the overflowing river that led to flooding in her part of the slum. The culprit, she said, was a drainage pipeline with a manhole right in front of her house. “All the basti women spent at least six hours yesterday trying to drain the water out of our houses, one bucket at a time,” she said. “Now we are exhausted, but what can we do? This is how things are.”

A drain right near Priyanka Shastri's slum home caused the flood in her room on Tuesday. Photo credit: Aarefa Johari.

The Davnes of Janseva slum have not, however, been in such a forgiving mood. They blame the flood squarely on local municipal officials who allegedly failed to clean out all the plastic and other trash from the gutters near the slum.

“Every monsoon the municipal workers come and clean the gutters, but this year when they came, they insisted that we pay them Rs 300 each for the job,” said Atmaram Davne. “We survive on barely Rs 3,000 month and have trouble affording three meals a day. How can we afford to pay municipal workers too?”

In Bandra, Ida Mascarenhas is also upset with local municipal workers. “Normally when the roads get flooded, the ward office workers come to open the manholes, but this time, no one was in sight,” said Mascarenhas. “Our neighbours eventually opened up the local manhole themselves, to allow the water to drain out with the tide.”",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

While tropical storm Harvey in Texas has grabbed more international attention, flooding in South Asia has been quite severe: already a thousand people have died. This year, among the main sufferers of this regular annual event have been the residents of Mumbai, India’s financial capital. On Tuesday, roads were jammed with residents wading through knee-deep water. Over 30 lakh commuters were affected by delayed local train services as train lines lay inundated. Overcrowded and flooded government hospitals are now facing the risk of spreading infections, exposing citizens to a public health crisis.

Residents were reminded of the 2005 flood that left the city in a similar state of paralysis. Over a thousand people lost their lives and essential infrastructure, including airports, local trains, power and telecommunication systems were all shut down. Sadly, no real lessons have been learnt.

For most part of the monsoon season this year, a significant part of India has been submerged in flood waters. Incessant rains in Gujarat, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Bengal, Odisha and Bihar have triggered floods leading often to emergency situations. Most politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have conveniently blamed climate change for floods that have impacted millions of people, paralysed local economies and caused deaths and serious economic upheavals.

India is one of the world’s most flood-prone countries with 113 million people exposed to floods. According to a UN report India’s average annual economic loss due to disasters is estimated to be $9.8 billion, out of which more than $7 billion loss is due to floods. Flooding in urban areas is a particularly challenging problem. Similar to the havoc in Mumbai, several such events have occurred in some of the major cities such as Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi, Gurugram and Bengaluru during the past decade.

Climatic impacts on urban environments demand greater scrutiny and better planning. India has failed to offer any long-term solutions. Unplanned urban growth increases risk to natural hazards like floods. In addition real estate-driven developments, poor city planning, lack of accountability of all levels of government and political neglect have left cities to the vagaries of extreme climate.

Urban ecosystems comprising marshlands, wetlands, lakes and rivers which could attenuate floods have steadily deteriorated. Encroachment and illegal construction in flood-prone areas and indiscriminate destruction of green areas have steadily reduced the resilience of cities to withstand serious flooding.

Consider Bengaluru. Once a city of 2,500 lakes, it boasted an efficient storm water drainage system of interconnected lakes. If one lake overflowed water would automatically flow to another lake. With increasing encroachment and solid wastes blocking the channels, floodwater cannot flow to the next water body, resulting in frequent inundations.

Non-functional land use planning has impacted water bodies and drainage system in other major cities like Hyderabad, which has reported extinction of 375 lakes, and Delhi, where 274 of 611 water bodies have dried up due to neglect and exploitation. Gurugram, a lowland area, has emerged as one of India’s most important industrial hubs. Many of its residential areas are still not connected to any drainage system. Thus, it is not surprising that roads in Gurugram are severely water-logged each monsoon season resulting in traffic snarls lasting up to 20 hours.

Proactive actions from municipal governments are essential to address the negative impacts of urban floods. Without strict adherence to land-use planning and construction laws, it is impossible for any city to manage its growing pressures and adequately plan its infrastructure. Not a single Indian city has a drainage system that can promptly evacuate intense monsoon rainfalls that occur over short time periods. Even these inadequate systems are never properly maintained.

In the case of Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) spent only close to 10% of its designated funds on civil infrastructure last year. Despite a budget of Rs 12,000 crore specifically allocated for development projects on roads, storm water drainage and water works, BMC did not take any initiatives to upgrade the infrastructure facilities. A report in this newspaper revealed that a large part of the BMC money amounting to Rs 61,000 crore lies in fixed deposits.

Even the funds that are used address immediate civic pressures rather than plan for long-term infrastructure creation. A similar situation exists in other major cities where the municipal corporations inflate their budgets but fail to carry out any significant developmental work.

Floods represent a major paradox. Nearly all Indian towns and cities are water-scarce in dry seasons and prone to severe flooding during monsoons. Cities like Delhi, which witness floods every monsoon, are also some of the most water-stressed in the world. This is a serious indictment of the poor state of India’s water management.

Flood waters in urban areas should be stored for use during non-monsoon seasons, both in terms of groundwater and surface storage. This is essential if expanding Indian cities are to have year-round water security and control floods. These are controllable with proper planning including functional drainage systems, storing excess of floodwater for use in dry seasons and coordinated water and land use planning. Singapore, another monsoon country, has for the most part solved urban drainage and water security problems by installing a proper and functional drainage system and then collecting all rainwater for urban use.

It is high time Indian politicians stopped blaming urban flooding on climate change and started planning for secure urban futures. As Shakespeare said “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves, that we are underlings.”

Doctors said that some sections, such as the paediatric ward, had knee deep water. “I would advise people to not come to the hospital,” said Dr Sagar Mundada, psychiatrist, working at the hospital

Doctors from the hospital said that the water started seeping inside the hospital in the morning. “In no time, wards on ground floor like paediatric went under water. We have heard the situation is almost similar in other hospitals located in low-lying areas,” said a doctor from the hospital.

Click here

In close proximity to the office, 30 of 45 staff quarters were inundated and homes of forest guards wrecked. A retaining wall at the tourist zone of the park also collapsed on Tuesday.

SGNP officers said the impact of Tuesday’s rainfall was much more than what the park witnessed during the July 26, 2005 floods. “There was over five-foot water inside the main office area on Tuesday afternoon. All our furniture was completely damaged. All our documents have been destroyed because of the water. Keeping all these issues in mind, we decided to close the park until the situation becomes better,” said Kishore Thakre, acting chief conservator of forest, SGNP. “Only half of this much damage was witnessed during the 2005 deluge. If the rains would have continued through the night, captive animals would be seriously affected.”

He added that another source for the flooding was the overflowing Tulsi and Vihar lakes located within the park’s premises. “There was reverse overflow of the Tulsi lake due to Tuesday’s torrential rains, which has not been witnessed in the past. It is common that during heavy rains that Vihar lake overflows. Due to the heavy flow of water from these lakes and constant downpour a retaining wall, walking paths and close to five culverts were damaged at SGNP,” he said.

The suburban deputy collector and the revenue officer from Andheri visited SGNP on Wednesday to take stock of the damage. “It is unfortunate that the city’s only national park had to bear the brunt of heavy rainfall. We have told the forest department to recover the forest records and important documents first and begin restoration work. We hope the park will be functional by next week,” said Satyanaryan Bajaj, Mumbai suburban deputy collector.

307,307,mumbai,2017,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/mumbai-floods-bmc-what-drowned-mumbai-4824532/,2 Sept 2017,What drowned Mumbai,"“If the heavens fall, what can we do?” That about sums up what an irate Mumbai Municipal Commissioner said to the media after Tuesday’s floods. In a way, Ajoy Mehta’s angry response was justified. All day long, every television channel was beaming footage of flooded streets, marooned cars, stationary trains, men and women wading through water. Television “experts” (me included) heaped blame on the BMC. The more aggressive channels shouted, “Municipal Commissioner, give us our Rs 440 crore back!” that being the sum supposedly spent on flood control measures.

What Mehta saw were the positives: All the BMC services were running — there was BEST power, water supply, only one wall collapse. All the water pumps functioned faultlessly so that 9,000 million litres of water (equal to two Tulsi lakes) were pumped out in five hours. All this was achieved because municipal employees worked tirelessly.

To Mehta’s positives, we can add our own: The police force acquitted itself admirably. If it was difficult for people to wade through water, it was even more difficult for policemen to carry on working in those conditions. As Anand Mahindra, in a tweet, pointed out, in Houston, Texas, the police had to stop people from looting stores during the floods; here people did just the opposite — they helped others in distress, gave food packets to stranded passengers. There are so many stories of small acts of heroism everywhere, that I, as a Mumbaikar, feel proud that in times of great calamities, the city’s human spirit asserts itself in so many noble ways. When Nature vents her fury, we human beings realise how puny we really are, but our courage lies in doing what we can. When the dust has settled, and the water has receded, however, we have to ask the central question: Must it always be so? In the age of technological advances, must we always plead helplessness when Nature decides to strut her stuff?

The much maligned India Meteorological Department (IMD), apparently had warned of a deluge-like situation a day earlier. Why was this not heeded? Is this part of our national trait to fight heroically when the emergency happens, but not to take preventive steps when the effects of the deluge would have been reduced by closing schools and colleges and issuing a general advance warning? Why wasn’t that done? Is it because of the IMD’s poor track record that the state didn’t take its warning seriously?

The IMD has an excuse for its continuing failure. It says it just does not have the computing power to process all the data from satellites, but the state does nothing about it. In the same way, one of the important instruments for accurate weather forecasting is the Doppler radar which measures “precipitation in a thunderstorm”. The whole of India has 10 of these (UK, by the way, has the same number, although it’s no bigger than a large Indian state). Twenty-five more have been approved, while the plan is to ultimately have 55 Dopplers. Alas, time and Nature wait for no man-made delays.

Other man-made delays abound, but before we get to that, one simple question: What is the role the TV medium assigns itself? All channels continuously castigated the BMC and other authorities over their failures. But surely that could have waited for a post-mortem the next day? The important thing was to keep citizens informed about the precise situation, hour by hour, area by area. Instead, what we saw was the same general footage of a drowning city, some of it shot at noon and shown again and again till late in the evening. Mumbai has a real problem at high tide, especially in low-lying areas; the problem reduces considerably at low tide. High tide on Tuesday was at 4.30 PM, low tide at 11.30 PM. Therefore, it was foolhardy to venture out between noon and, say, 5.30, while at 9 PM, most streets were clear (I went into a dry Worli at that time when it was flooded at 3 PM).

If people had been told this by TV channels, they would have stayed put in their workplaces till the evening. If people had been told trains had stopped running, they wouldn’t have waited for hours at railway platforms. Television and radio reach a maximum number of people; telephone helplines are useless because they soon get jammed. An alternative solution in this day of the ubiquitous mobile phone is for the state government to start an emergency app which gives accurate and vital information.

Now to the difficult part. Difficult because it needs two things that seem impossible for the bureaucracy to grapple with — planning and implementation. The records for one day rainfall in Mumbai are 944 mm on July 26, 2005, 576 mm on July 5, 1974, 315 mm on Tuesday August 29, 2017 and 233 mm on August 29, 2011. These figures cover 43 years, so we could say the city gets one massive downpour per decade. But actually, that’s not so: Three of these deluges have happened in the last 12 years. We know why: Global warming, or climate change, is now biting hard. Common sense tells us that it will be too expensive to have a system that is able to cope with these extreme eventualities, but surely an efficient system that can effectively manage the normal annual maximum rainfall will make abnormal conditions less painful? What answer does the BMC have to the slow progress in implementing the BRIMSTOWAD plan formulated in 1985 to expand the stormwater capacity of the city’s drainage system? The Mithi river comes up in conversations again and again, but its cleaning-up seems to be done in a very routine way. These two measures really need to be taken up as if nothing else mattered.

But something else does matter. And that is the official attitude to the environment. As this newspaper has pointed out editorially, “there has been little inclination to place the restoration of wetlands at the centre of flood control programmes.” Politicians see development as being what developers do, which is to build, build and build. The importance of open spaces, of checking concretisation and construction and the protection of mangroves and salt pans is never understood.

In 2005, a 24-hour period saw 944 mm of rain, which took a huge toll on the city. At least 450 lives were lost during the floods, and another 248 later, while 300,000 citizens required medical attention. The floods caused damage to 20,000 cars, 2,500 BEST buses, and countless number of two and three-wheelers. Around 200,000 tonnes of garbage — washed away or water-soaked furniture, foodstuffs, appliances — had to be cleared up. Furthermore, to prevent an epidemic of monsoon-related diseases, 24 metric tonnes of bleaching powder and 2 metric tonnes of disinfectant were used.

The cloudburst of 2005, a freak occurrence, demonstrated the inability of the city to cope with unbridled development. It revealed that the administration was woefully unprepared to face disasters.

In contrast, 330mm of rain fell on August 29. Mumbai’s response was substantially different. Five stormwater pumping stations, 229 dewatering pumps and 50 sewage pumping stations extricated 7,000 million litres into the sea. As many as 69 schools were converted into shelters, accommodating 5,000 people.

The administration, police and Mumbaikars at large ensured that the city was more organised this time. Unlike 2005, when civic workers could not report back on duty, on August 29, 28,000 civic workers removed 9,500 metric tonnes of garbage.

But the old problem of multiple planning authorities — Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, Slum Redevelopment Authority, Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd – remains. A variety of careless development permissions and reckless infrastructure execution are equally, if not more, responsible for the flooding in the city.

After the 2005 floods, under the chairmanship of Dr Madhavrao Chitale, a fact finding committee of experts was set up to assess the disaster preparedness and management of Mumbai. A comprehensive report was published the following year, which became a handbook of sorts for the municipal corporation, and significantly influenced the 2009 national guidelines on urban flood management. However, the Committee’s recommendations continue to be sluggishly implemented for over a decade.

Mumbai’s monsoon problems — potholes, overflowing drains, flooding — are manifestations of a larger fundamental urban planning issue. The city managers, urban planners and developers seem to turn a blind eye to the real challenges of climate change, seemingly reliant on the Donald Trumpian disbelief towards global warming and rising sea levels.

Storm Water Drainage

Mumbai’s drainage system can deal with about 25 mm of rain per hour. In the suburbs, the drainage capacity is expected to double to 50 mm per hour through the Brimstowad (an awkward acronym for Brihanmumbai Storm Water Disposal system) projects. But, every year, Mumbai records several days of heavy rainfall, exceeding 65 mm per hour, which means extended flooding. Even the proposed enhanced drainage capacity of 50 mm per hour won’t be able to deal with this. It might, therefore, be better to design and execute the stormwater drain’s capacity to 100mm per hour.

When we construct over green, open spaces, or permit ‘innovative’ green spaces on concrete surfaces, the rain falls on these impervious surfaces. Instead of being absorbed into the earth and replenishing ground water, it gushes down drains and nullahs, overflowing onto roads. Our already overwhelmed storm water drainage networks are further overloaded, leading to waterlogging and severe flooding.

• Better inter-agency coordination is needed to ensure that building permissions are not recklessly approved on low-lying, flood-prone areas.

• Mumbai needs more pumping stations. However, given the BMC’s current rate of project implementation, it would take two decades to install six new pumping stations at a whopping cost of Rs 3000 crore.

• Allowing development contrary to the natural water course collapses the city’s defences against the monsoon’s onslaught. The Storm Water Drains department’s topographic contours map, created using aerial photography and photogrammetric mapping, must be carefully studied while planning for flood management.

• A refurbishment of stormwater drains, sewerage operations and solid waste management systems seems inevitable, including digging up and resurfacing of roads. Though this will entail a massive expenditure of taxpayers’ money, it will be worthwhile when compared to the cost of significantly disrupting city life every year, adding hidden public and private costs in recovery and rehabilitation.

Natural watershed and drains

It is important to also take a look at the streams and seasonal nullahs which typically dry up after the monsoons. Like in other parts of the Konkan, Mumbai also has natural creeks and nullahs, or rather, had nullahs that are now just stinking gutters. Slums routinely empty waste and industries pipe untreated effluents into them. Often, sewer lines end in natural stormwater drains. Their deposits add silt to the nullahs, which means that shallow nullahs already have reduced capacity to drain storm water.

In 2005, the flooding of the Mithi river also hugely contributed to the deluge. Concerted effort needs to be made to provide basic civic amenities to slum residents which will assist in hygienically disposing their waste.

The first phase of deepening and widening of the Mithi river was completed in June 2006. The second phase, which started in April 2007 and relocated 5,000 structures, remains to be completed, as 1,300 structures yet to be relocated.

Specific guidelines should be in place, so that strict action is taken against anyone, notably industries, from polluting these streams.

We, the responsible citizens of Mumbai, must also refrain from dumping waste in stormwater drains.

Natural Open spaces

Advertisement

As per the Revised Draft Development Plan 2034 (RDDP), allocation of open spaces is 2.8 sq.mt per person, just over one-fourth the standard space of 10 sq. mt per person (set out in the National Urban and Regional Development Planning Formulation and Implementation Guideline, Ministry of Urban Development).

But the proposed RDDP opens up No-Development Zones (NDZs) for construction and advocates building of roads on mangroves and other natural areas.

Similarly, permitting recreational spaces on open-to-sky podiums of buildings, or underground parking lots below gardens and playgrounds may seem attractive and add large swathes of green to the city. But these are in fact impervious concrete surfaces which hamper the rate of stormwater run-off. Such provisions are also contrary to the standing 2013 Supreme Court judgement which prohibits mandatory open spaces on podium.

• Natural green spaces are not just good for the soul; they play a very important role in increasing the rate of groundwater percolation, act like holding ponds and increase the rainfall’s ‘time of retention’, thereby drastically reducing the pressure on stormwater drains in the city.

• The State must pay heed to the Bombay HC’s scathing criticism towards destroying mangroves under the garb of “development.” The BMC must not only protect mangroves, which aid in preventing soil erosion, but also protect the National Park, Aarey Colony and salt pan lands. These natural resources may not be public open spaces which we can use for recreational purposes, but play a huge role in protecting the city from the ravages of the monsoon, absorbing rainfall and replenishing water sources.

Disaster Preparedness: Rescue, Relief, and Recovery

Disaster management without a plan is like Swachch Mumbai without dustbins, a Walkable Mumbai without footpaths or a Digital Mumbai without internet connectivity for all. The BMC has a state-size budget with crores spent annually on operations, maintenance and repairs. And yet, we remain only a step away from another 2005. This annual token exercise of pre-monsoon preparation by the various departments of the BMC will hardly prevent a disaster-in-waiting.

Mumbai, in 2017, exhibited coordination amongst the state, local authority, institutions, religious/ social bodies and private actors. This network needs to be documented, strengthened and disseminated under a tangible post-disaster strategy.

Floods in Uttarakhand (2013 and 2016), Chennai (2015) and Mumbai (2005 and 2017) demonstrate that unregulated construction on natural drains and riverbeds precipitated devastating floods. But the state seems to be reluctant to learn from these mistakes.

Celebrated architect and visionary Charles Correa, once in a conversation on Mumbai, would often bring up the parable of a frog in water – if you drop a frog in hot water, it will immediately jump out. But if you drop it in tepid water and slowly raise the temperature, it will swim around unawares, adjusting itself to the heat till it dies.

Mumbai once again almost came to a standstill on account of heavy rain. But the rainfall over the last day is nowhere as overwhelming as what the city experienced on 26th July 2005 when it received almost 95 cm of rain.

The damage wrought by the rainfall on 29th August (Tuesday) could have been mitigated if the municipal authorities and state government cared enough. Given the frequent floods in the city, it is apparent that they have not cared enough over decades.

Three factors cause urban flooding- meteorological, hydrological and human. There is nothing anyone in government can do about the first two factors, but failure in the third factor is what leaves a trail of destruction.

Mumbai’s problems are unique in one sense. Reclamation of land was initially carried out to link the seven islands which form Mumbai. This was followed by continuous building activity which eventually spilled over to choke waterways which allowed water to drain during monsoon.

The city’s storm water drainage system is a network of surface drains, underground drains and canals which discharge surface run-off into the city’s creeks, river or straight into the Arabian Sea.

Perhaps the most important component of the drainage network is the Mithi river which serves as the line of demarcation between the city and its suburbs.

Mithi river has over the years been not only been encroached upon, but whatever is left is clogged with solid wastes and plastic.

With perhaps the most important channel of the city’s drainage system under siege, flooding is inevitable even if the rainfall does not breach the existing record.

Any long-term solution to Mumbai’s frequent flooding problem needs to deal with the reduction in the catchment area of Mithi river. Unless the channels are widened and the plastic menace dealt with, other efforts may be inadequate.

Mangroves which dotted the city’s coast line have largely disappeared. They once served as as an important element in absorbing water and, thereby, mitigated the impact of torrential rain. It may no longer be possible to go back to the mangrove cover which existed years ago, but it is essential to protect whatever is left.

It is simply not right that Mumbai should crumble so often. The intensity of urban flooding can be reduced.

Rescuers, residents and police officers managed to pull 30 injured people from the rubble, but more than a dozen were missing and feared trapped.

The building was one of thousands in Mumbai that are more than 100 years old, with foundations that have been weakened by years of heavy monsoon rains.

Last month, another four-storey building toppled in the city’s suburb of Ghatkopar, killing 17.

Thursday’s tragedy occurred in a congested area of Mumbai’s southern Bhendi Bazaar area, following the city’s heaviest rainfall in 15 years.

Authorities were advising people living in an adjacent building to vacate after it developed cracks following Thursday’s early morning collapse.

It was not immediately clear how many people might be trapped in the toppled building. The building had housed nine families in apartments above a first-floor nursery school, but the collapse occurred before the toddlers had arrived for the day, police said.

Hours later, rescuers used earth-moving machines to lift concrete slabs and cement blocks as they searched for survivors.

Building collapses are common in India during the monsoon season, which is June to September.

High demand and lax regulations encourage some builders to use substandard materials or add unauthorised extra floors.

Every year Mumbai struggles to cope with the annual monsoon deluge, drawing criticism about its poor planning.

Deforestation, which allows water to stream downhill rather than being slowed down by trees, also contributes to the severe floods.

Since the start of the season, devastating floods across South Asia have killed at least 1,000 people and affected close to 40 million across northern India, southern Nepal and northern Bangladesh.

The rains have led to wide-scale flooding in a broad arc stretching across the Himalayan foothills in the three countries, causing landslides, damaging roads and electric towers and washing away tens of thousands of homes and vast swathes of farmland.

India has a plan to alleviate its regular floods by linking large rivers across the country via a network of 30 mega-canals, effectively creating the world’s longest river.

Devendra, who lives in small house made of tin sheets in a slum in the Govandi suburb in Mumbai with her husband and six children, even thought that they might all drown. “The roof was leaking and water was entering the house from all four sides,” she recalled. “It was raining so heavily, that I thought that the roof would collapse.”

Lakhs of families live in such houses in Govandi. Their only protection against heavy rains, like the downpour on Tuesday, are blue tarpaulin sheets spread on roofs to stop water from seeping into the houses. But, that day, as the streets of Mumbai flooded, these homes quickly filled up with water entering through the doors and even seeping in through non-tiled floors.

In Govandi, flooding does not just bring rain water, but also sewage from overflowing drains and toxic runoff from the garbage dumping ground in neighbouring Deonar.

“We could see plastic wrappers [discarded in the garbage dump] floating in the water,” said Shabnam Qureshi, who lives with her son in a Govandi slum called Indira Nagar. “I saw so many centipedes and some other insects crawling in the house.”

The floor in Qureshi’s house is just a layer of mud on which the family lays mats to sleep. “The roof was leaking and water was oozing out of the ground,” said Qureshi. After the Tuesday rains, she placed paver blocks, normally used to pave footpaths in the city, as flooring.

Both Qureshi and Devendra and members of their families fell ill with fever following the rains on Tuesday. “I went to the municipality dispensary and my son took a paracetamol as he didn’t have time to go to the hospital,” said Qureshi.

Devendra borrowed Rs 200 from her neighbours to take her one-year-old son Yogesh to a private clinic. During the rains, Devendra’s children took shelter in the loft of the house even as water from the drain outside flooded the house below, submerging the family’s few belongings. “Yogesh was on the loft with all the children.,” said Devendra who was sitting on a plastic can placed in a pool of water that had not cleared since the rains. “His body was burning but we could not take him to the doctor.”

Devendra’s 14-year-old neighbour Sanah Parveen also fell ill with fever. “All the clothes were wet, we were wearing the same wet clothes throughout the night,” she said.

More rain, more disease

The municipality dispensary in Govandi’s Baiganwadi – the locality that also has Mumbai’s oldest and largest dumping ground – has seen more patients with complains of fever, body pain, skin infections since the rains last week.

“Most patients here have skin infections owing to the poor living conditions,” said Dr Suresh Uchale, medical officer of the dispensary. “There are also cases of viral fever, which are not unusual in monsoon.”

Health authorities and doctors in the area are, however, keeping an eye out for signs of leptospirosis infections. Leptospirosis is spread by the bacterium Leptospira that causes fever, headache, bleeding, chills and vomiting and, if not treated in time, can lead to liver and kidney failure and even death. The bacterium is often found in the urine of infected animals like rats, dogs, pigs, cattle, all of which are found in abundance in the Deonar dumping grounds. As rain water washes through the dumping grounds, seeps into Govandi’s slums and accumulates in its their streets, people wading through the water are exposed to the infected urine. Those with cuts or bruises on their legs and feet are especially at risk of contracting infection. When Mumbai flooded in July 2005, many parts of the city and adjoining districts witnessed similar waterlogging and there was a surge in the number of cases and deaths owing to leptospirosis.

Even before the rains and flooding last week, Mumbai recorded 27 cases of leptospirosis between August 1 and August 15.

Leptospirosis can be treated with antibiotics. But the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s health department is taking preventive measures and has issued a health advisory asking people to take a prophylaxis treatment against leptospirosis, which involves doses of the antibiotic doxycycline for those at risk of exposure and doses of azithromycin for pregnant women and children.

“The prophylaxis works best when given within 48 to 70 hours of the exposure,” said Dr Om Shrivastav, infectious disease consultant from Mumbai. “After that if someone has contracted the infection, they will start exhibiting symptoms and will have to be given the necessary [antibiotic] treatment.”

Since Tuesday, The city corporation has administered prophylaxis to 24,898 adults, 1,261 children and 74 pregnant women in different parts of the city who had waded through flood waters.

However, given that the efficacy of the prophylaxis is time bound, the civic body’s health department is struggling to deliver the treatment in Govandi. On Friday, more than 48 hours after the rains and flooding, Scroll.in visited many homes in Govandi where families had not been contacted by health workers for treatment. “We are trying to cover as much population as possible but it is impossible to cover the entire slum,” said a medical officer from the locality.

Leptospirosis is only one of the many risks from the toxic waters that have flooded Govandi.

“We don’t know the long-term health consequences of this toxic water entering the homes of this marginalised population,” said Arun Kumar, the chief executive officer of Apnalaya, a non-governmental organisation working in these slums.

No food, lower immunity

Already at risk for many infections, the residents of Govandi have also been left with depleted food stocks after the rains. The flood waters soaked the grains stories inside homes. “There was only one cot in the house,” said Laadli Parveen, a mother of four. “We all were sitting on the cot to save ourselves throughout the night. There was no chance of saving our grains.”

Devendra’s children went hungry on the night of the floods. “I had saved money to so I can buy food grains in bulk at a cheaper rate,” said Devendra. “All that is gone.”

She bought half a kilogram of rice the next day to feed her large family.

“The corporator comes asking for votes but he didn’t think of sending us some food that night,” said Qureshi agitatedly.

Several children in the area are already malnourished who are more likely to fall ill because of their low immunity. Health activists said the disruption caused by the rains has affected malnutrition control programmes being run in the slums. “Many children have been suffering from diarrhoea after the rains,” said Sunita Choure, programme manager at Apnalaya.

Meanwhile, the already poor residents of Shivaji Nagar are spending hefty sums of money to rebuild what they lost in Tuesday’s floods and protect themselves against other similar incidents. Jahira Banu took a loan of Rs 20,000 from a local money lender to plaster the mud floor of her house. “I first tried to fill the land with some sand, I purchased but the water still kept on oozing out of the ground.”

Banu, who does zari work, plans to pay her loan installments by stitching more. “I will have to work late nights but at least next time when it rains like this, our house will not be destroyed completely.”",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
314,314,mumbai,2017,https://scroll.in/article/827238/climate-change-could-be-making-mumbai-more-vulnerable-to-cyclonic-storms-and-flooding,21 Jan 2017,Climate change could be making Mumbai more vulnerable to cyclonic storms and flooding,"Many older citizens of Mumbai vividly recall the cyclone that hit the metropolis in 1948. As strong winds and rain lashed the city incessantly, the sky was completely overcast for a few days and a sense of menace pervaded the city. Trees were uprooted in large numbers and there was extensive property damage.

Indelible memories of that cataclysmic event came back to mind as this reporter attended a full-day workshop on Cyclones & Storm Surges: Building a Framework for Evaluating the Climate Risk to Mumbai, organised by Columbia University’s Global Centre in Mumbai recently. It was led by Adam Sobel, a meteorologist who heads a new Initiative on Weather Risk and Climate at the New York-based university.

Sobel is familiar to some Indian readers because he is cited by Amitav Ghosh in his recent non-fiction book, The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable, for detailing how Hurricane Sandy, which hit New York in 2012, was frequently described as an “unprecedented” phenomenon and wasn’t expected, like many repercussions of climate change.

Sobel wrote a book titled Storm Surge: Hurricane Sandy, Our Changing Climate, and Extreme Weather of the Past and Future in 2014. A surge is the rise in sea level as the winds whipped up by a storm propel ocean water on to the shore. He states how losing one’s life to a hurricane is “something that happens in faraway places” and Ghosh began to wonder if a storm of this magnitude could hit Mumbai, also a coastal megacity and a commercial hub, and contacted Sobel. That started the New Yorker thinking.

In 2013, Mumbai was listed by the journal Nature Climate Change as the fifth coastal city in the world to be most affected by flooding in the future, measured by economic losses. The first four are Guangzhou, Miami, New York-Newark and New Orleans.

Link with climate change

In his presentation, Sobel raised the possibility of linking Mumbai being the landfall in the event of a severe storm in the future and low-lying areas being flooded with climate change. He hastened to assert that investigations were at a very preliminary level and his team was embarking on a two-year study. They displayed a hypothetical model of how a cyclone would impact Mumbai and will resort extensively to modelling to assess possible impacts.

According to a recent unpublished paper by R Mani Murali from the National Institute of Oceanography in Goa, Mumbai has some coastal areas as low as 6-8 metres above sea level, with an average elevation of 14 metres. It is well known that Bombay originally consisted of seven islands, which were reclaimed. Many low-lying areas in what is still known as the island city are those that were inadequately reclaimed from the 19th century onwards.

At the Mumbai workshop, the former Director General of the India Meteorological Department, RR Kelkar, outlined how the first reclamations were by a private company, followed by the Bombay Port Trust and lastly by the state government till campaigns by environmentalists halted it in 1974.

In July 2005, Mumbai got a premonition of what lies ahead if a storm hits it when 94.4 cm of rain fell in 24 hours in the northern suburbs, while the island city was relatively unscathed. The official fact-finding committee, headed by the well-known hydrologist Madhav Chitale, published maps identifying vulnerable areas throughout Mumbai.

Cyclonic activity will rise

According to Ghosh, the most recent research shows that the Arabian Sea is one of the world’s regions where cyclonic activity is likely to rise. He cites a 2012 paper by a Japanese research team, which predicts a 46% rise in tropical cyclones by the end of the next century, with a corresponding 31% decrease in the Bay of Bengal. 2015 was the first year in which the Arabian Sea is known to have more storms than the Bay of Bengal, while the latter has historically been hit by far more and fiercer storms.

Cyclones are more likely to occur during and after the monsoons. American researchers show that cyclonic activity in the Arabian Sea is likely to intensify due to the suspended particulate matter over the Indian subcontinent and its surrounding waters, all of which contribute to altering the region’s wind patterns.

In an article in the Times of India in 2015, Sobel wrote: “Between 1998 and 2001, three cyclones struck the west coast of the subcontinent, not far from Mumbai. Just in the past few weeks, Yemen was struck by two cyclones in the space of a single week. One of them, Chapala, was the strongest to make landfall there in known history. El Nino may be a factor this year, but the unusual Arabian Sea cyclone activity has been going on for a longer period.”

Ghosh adds that these three cyclones claimed over 17,000 lives. “Then in 2007, the Arabian Sea generated its strongest ever recorded storm: Cyclone Gonu, a Category 5 hurricane, which hit Oman, Iran and Pakistan in June that year, causing widespread damage,” he wrote.

Because these have taken place north of India, they didn’t attract much attention. However, there were two severe cyclones, which hit the Gujarat coast between 1972 and 2015. The 1998 event was very severe, with over 10,000 deaths and losses amounting to $290 million.

Preparing for storms

Experts believe that given this increasing risk, coastal cities must prepare for such eventualities. Sobel pointed out that the administration should identify which areas are prone to flooding, which is already available for Mumbai.

Secondly, what is the threat to lives and property? As many as 447 people lost their lives in the city in 2005, as detailed by the report titled Mumbai Marooned: An Enquiry into the Mumbai Floods by the Concerned Citizens’ Commission, on which this writer served.

The total economic loss was put at Rs 28 billion ($41 million), of which Rs 10 billion was of infrastructure. The airport, which was on reclaimed land where the Mithi River, was bent twice at right angles to permit runways, was inundated for three days.

One has only to realise that Mumbai – and Chennai, which was hit by cyclones in 2015 and 2016 – are hubs for international IT firms and can’t tolerate a disruption in communications.

Evacuation plans

Evacuation plans should be put in place. In 2005, no Mumbaikars could access higher ground because the roads and railway tracks were under water. Boats, which could have worked, were not provided for rescue or relief.

While the influence of climate change on cyclonic storms lies in the realm of uncertainty, the same doesn’t hold true of sea level rise. Due to the melting of polar ice caps because of global warming, ocean levels throughout the world are rising.

At the launch of his book in Mumbai, Ghosh unsettled his audience by pointing out that some of the most expensive real estate in the world lies along the west coast of Mumbai. According to the unpublished paper by Murali of National Institute of Oceanography, as much as 40% of Greater Mumbai – a staggering 190 sq km – could be under water within a century.

“Going by previous studies by NIO [National Institute of Oceanography] researchers, we considered a three mm rise (annually) in sea levels along Mumbai’s coast. That, coupled with factors such as natural calamities and tidal changes, will result in an approximate increase of three metres,” Murali told the Hindustan Times.

Another multidisciplinary study in 2012 by 220 Indian scientists from 120 institutes forming part of India’s second communication to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change stated: “It is estimated that sea level rise by 3.5 to 34.6 inches (8.89-87.88 cm) between 1990 and 2100 would result in saline coastal groundwater, endangering wetlands and inundating valuable land and coastal communities. The most vulnerable stretches along the western Indian coast are Khambat and Kutch in Gujarat, Mumbai and parts of the Konkan coast and south Kerala.”

Ironically, such submergence would hit two extremes – the very wealthy living in high-rises along the coast and the poorest shanty dwellers who live on mudflats, given the astronomical real estate values. Mumbai is unique in that nearly 60% of its 13 million inhabitants are slum dwellers who, however, only occupy around 9% of the area.

Rising sea levels

The geography department of SP College in Pune has been studying sea level rise in the Konkan coast from Dahanu, just north of Mumbai, to Vengurla to the south. Over 20 years, levels have risen by 5-6 cm. On a full moon night in 2009, the high tide rose by 4 cm near Ratnagiri, which was much higher than previously recorded. In recent years, sea levels were rising at a much faster pace.

A 5-6 cm rise has led to the ingress of sea water up to 1 km inland, eroding beaches, harming mangroves and coconut and cashew plantations. The geographers find that tidal patterns are getting increasingly erratic.

The standard response of the authorities only when the situation gets too serious is to construct bunds to keep the sea at bay. These cost as much as Rs 60,000 per metre and are only built at certain stretches.

In their extensively researched 2016 book, How the World Breaks: Life in Catastrophe’s Path, from the Caribbean to Siberia, Stan and Paul Cox cite the 2005 Mumbai floods. “The sheer scale of this disaster and the fact that it brought an entire metropolis, India’s biggest and richest, to its knees was enough to send storm drainage straight to the top of Mumbai’s long list of urgent issues,” they write.

The authors quote Aromar Revi, Director of the Indian Institute of Human Settlements in Bangalore: “It was clear to many million people in Mumbai that life may never be quite the same again. An exceptional rainstorm finally put to rest the long-prevailing myth of Mumbai’s indestructible resilience to all kinds of shocks.”

They conclude on a sombre but truthful note:

“In the minds of many, an event that overwhelming should have served as a wake-up call. But while it unmasked Mumbai’s increasing vulnerability, the flood appeared to stiffen the city’s resistance to any policy changes that might undermine its famed moneymaking prowess.Heedless maldevelopment has continued. Meanwhile, sea level rise combined with increased rainfall will dramatically increase the extent and depth of flooding, doubling the likelihood that a flood on the scale of the 2005 catastrophe will recur.”

315,315,mumbai,2017,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1157236/world,7 Sept 2017,"With no government help, Mumbai flood victims are on their own","MUMBAI: When Surekha Chiplunkar’s home started to flood during recent heavy rains in Mumbai she knew exactly what to do — she had to; catastrophe comes every year and no one else was going to help.

Her family’s tiny ground floor apartment in central Mumbai is one of hundreds of thousands of homes in India’s financial capital that regularly flood during the monsoon months of June to September.

“We grab all of our possessions and move to one of our neighbors on a higher floor until the water subsides,” explains the 60-year-old.

Last week, as floods wreaked unaccustomed havoc across parts of Texas, global news coverage was dominated by scenes of Americans being winched to safety.

People in Houston, America’s fourth biggest city, told reporters of their anguish at being forced from their homes by the unusually fierce Hurricane Harvey, as a sophisticated rescue and recovery operation revved into high gear.

President Donald Trump visited the affected area twice, while his vice president, Mike Pence, also went to assure Texans that the might of the US government was behind them, and would help them pick up the pieces in the wake of a storm that caused tens of billions of dollars’ damage and killed around 60 people.

At the same time, half a world away, monsoon rains were dumping millions of gallons of water on India.

Mumbai, a city of around 20 million inhabitants where at least ten people died, was brought to a virtual standstill for two days.

But there were no prime ministerial visits; no pledges of national unity; no promises to help the slum dwellers rebuild their washed-away homes.

India largely shrugged and carried on, almost inured to a near-annual tragedy.

“No one from the government comes to check to see if we have managed to survive the floods or not,” said Chiplunker.

“People from top floors provide us with food during flooding as we cannot cook for ourselves.”

The help provided by members of the community during a disaster is often referred to, usually by local newspapers and leaders, as the “spirit of Mumbai.”

Many of the homes that flood in Mumbai are shanties packed tightly into narrow dark alleyways lining the city’s sprawling slums.

The slums, where over 50 percent of Mumbai’s population live, become covered in a sea of blue tarpaulin every monsoon as residents try to keep out whatever rain they can.

But sturdily-built houses flood as well. Chiplunkar, her three sons, one daughter-in-law and two grandchildren, live in a basic flat built in an old chawl, or tenement, which used to house Mumbai’s mill workers.

“We prepare for every monsoon by packing our belongings in plastic covers and keeping buckets ready,” Aditya Jadhav, who lives in the one-room apartment opposite, tells AFP.

The speed with which the rain fell — more than 315 millimeters (12 inches) in just a few hours — caught both families by surprise this year though.

“We were shocked. A lot of our valuables were damaged this time including a refrigerator and washing machine, causing us a lot of financial loss,” says Chiplunkar.

Activists claim Mumbai’s susceptibility to floods has worsened in recent years due to a rapid construction boom that is trying to keep up with the city’s swelling population.

They blame many in power as well as property developers for an insatiable desire to make money from luxury residential tower developments built on reclaimed land.

An estimated 40 percent of Mumbai’s mangrove cover, which is extremely effective in helping to drain water, has been destroyed over the past decade to make way for glitzy high-rises.

“Mumbai’s estuaries have been tampered with and there is no space for water to flow out,” Stalin D, a director of the environmental non-profit organization Vanashakti, told AFP.

Mumbai’s drainage system was built by the British in the 1860s when the population was a tenth of what it is now. Many drains are full of rubbish and desilting operations are often inadequate, activists say.

While Chiplunkar and her neighbors are used to fleeing the floods at short notice, there’s one aspect they can never get used to — cleaning up on their return.

“All of us fall sick as the water is very dirty and sometimes we find dead rats in it. The children are particularly prone to getting diseases,” she says.",,2017 Mumbai floods,"Mumbai, India","July 24, 2017","July 26, 2017",Mumbai,315 mm (12 inches),$1 billion,10,"Thousands of homes flooded, millions of people displaced","The floods were caused by heavy monsoon rains.

His body was found lying unconscious in a car in Sion locality of Mumbai.

Local passersby spotted his car and informed the police. Soon after, police came to take out his body and rushed to the nearby hospital. He was, however, announced brought dead.

It is being speculated that the man was in his car while Mumbai was flooded and owing to automatic locking system in new-age cars, he got locked and was not able to come out in time. It is most likely that he died of suffocation waiting for the water level to go down.

The police found a bag and a mobile phone in the car and informed his family members. He has not been identified yet, but police say that he must be a lawyer as his car has a sticker saying 'lawyer'.

Sion police have registered Accidental Death Report in the case. This is not the first time however that such an incident has surfaced.

In 2005, when the entire state of Maharashtra was flooded due to incessant rains, several such cases of people found dead in their cars had become a major issue and the police at that time had issued a statement saying everyone should carry a sharp object so that they open the windows by breaking it.

Mumbai is currently facing a lockdown because of torrential rains for the past four consecutive days.

Every day, three lines of Railways help about 30 lakh commuters to return home from their workplaces. As the services were suspended on Tuesday, at least 10,000 commuters were stranded at railway stations and in local trains. Hundreds of them spent the entire night at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaja Terminus (CSMT) as well as Churchgate station. By morning on Wednesday, most of them were hoping that the services would start and they could reach home. While Western Railway services resumed, other two lines didn’t prove to be of much help for first few hours. In fact, it took them most of the day to resume normal services. Commuters and associations of commuters blamed the attitude of the authorities.

The local train services on the WR resumed late on Tuesday. The services on Central Railway were restored in the morning between CSMT and Kalyan at 7.26 am and Harbour line trains also began operating soon. Barely a few trains were running, that too with much delay. However, the trains were stopped by the railway authorities at 12.03pm owing to failure of local trains which were stuck in different areas. Four trains were stuck in Central and three in Western, diesel engines had to be called to take the failed local trains to car shed.

Further, the situation escalated after a tree fell at Dockyard Road station of the Harbour Railway, which resulted in further shutting the services on the Harbour route. The local trains resumed on the Central Railway route from CSMT towards Kalyan at 01.30 pm, however the local trains coming towards CSMT did not resume till evening. The local train services on the Harbour Railway completely resumed only at 05.48 pm. The only relief for commuters was that the congestion on road had reduced.

Even after the local train services began on both the Central and Western Railway, there was a 30-minute delay on both the routes. There were bunching of local trains and speed restrictions in different parts. The local train services on the Western Railway were delayed for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, there was a complete shut-down of 38 hours between Kasara to Titwala section. This was after the derailment of nine coaches of the Duronto Express which was on its way to Mumbai from Nagpur. Senior Central Railway officers worked for completely for 38 hours to re rail the coaches and lay the railway tracks which had been washed off completely due to the landslide. The tracks were given safe by the engineering department at 5.00 pm and the services between Kasara and Titwala began.

Railway Activist have raised questions on the failure of railway minister Suresh Prabhu to speak and mention about the bad conditions of the local trains and the derailment. Subhash Gupta, railway activist, said, “Despite the derailment of Duronto Express and the heavy rainfall in the city which led to the complete halt of the local train services, the railway minister did not tweet or acknowledge it.”",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

“Our officials are keeping a tab on the city 24x7. Whenever they get to know about an emergency, they will reach the spot,” the official said.

Anushka Khurana, a resident of Sanpada, said, “Because of heavy rain, I could not leave for work on time. The incessant rains kept me at home for over 20 minutes. I reached office around 40 minutes later than my usual time.”

Hundreds, from across Thane, Mira Bhayandar and Navi Mumbai, told stories on Wednesday of their eventful journey home from work — hitch-hiking, walking several kilometres and wading through water in different parts of Mumbai in the light of Tuesday’s inundation. The complete stalling of local trains meant it would take hours, perhaps days, before they got home. Some of them stayed put at their offices till the water began receding and started their journeys on Wednesday morning.

As climate change makes cloudbursts more likely, city authorities in Mumbai need to take immediate steps to effectively manage crisis situations through a participatory disaster management system

The past three months have seemed apocalyptic the world over. The storm season in the Atlantic Ocean continues to draw grave concern as hurricane Irma wreaked havoc in Florida, and hurricane Jose threatens to make a comeback next week. Already, hurricanes Harvey and Irma have claimed 97 lives in Texas, the Caribbean Islands and Florida, leaving behind an expanse of devastation.

Meanwhile, an earthquake of 8.1 magnitude — touted as the strongest in a century — hit Mexico, claiming up to 90 lives and damaging property across the poorer south. On the other side of the globe, in South Asia, the monsoon claimed more than 1,200 lives in India, Bangladesh and Nepal, and left millions displaced and homeless.

Indeed, climate uncertainties and the frequency of 100-year and 500-year extreme weather events are on the rise — an indicator of climate change. And, living in one of India’s densest cities, Mumbai, we constantly ask one question — are we prepared?

How prepared are we?

On August 29, Mumbai received 315 mm of rainfall in about 12 hours, bringing the city to its knees. This was recorded as a third of the rainfall received by the city in the last historic flood of July 2005, a reminder and an evidence of how unprepared our cities are to face extreme weather events.

Mumbai is exposed to various kinds of risks: coastal risks such as storm surges, cyclones, and sea level rise; torrential rainfall often resulting in annual floods, paralysing critical infrastructure and activities in low-lying areas; and a fault line starting in Panvel to Koparkhairne that leaves Mumbai’s eastern suburbs vulnerable to earthquakes.

Mumbai has a population of 12.44 million, and a workforce of 5.8 million people. A significant population work in the Island City with more than two million people using the suburban railway to commute to and from work every day. When a disaster hits Mumbai at midday, while most people are at work, a failure of all transit modes occurs, leaving people stranded at railway stations or in chaotic traffic jams.

Social capital is an asset

The story of the aftermath of a disaster in Mumbai has always been that of resilience. Rescue operations are often crowdsourced, organised locally and systematically, and once the waters calm down the city quickly resumes normalcy. This August too, when the disaster struck, most of our social media news feeds were flooded with people offering their homes for stay; religious institutions, schools and hospitals opened their doors for shelter and food. News channels, and civil society organisations published helpline numbers for emergency relief and rescue for each ward in the city. The city had come together once again.

This time however, with stories of social capital in the city, there was a lot more anger, criticism, and sharp questions to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). It was obvious to most that the Corporation had failed in managing the disaster effectively.

As in most Indian cities, Mumbai’s disaster management measures have always been reactive in their approach. Monitoring weather activities, pre-monsoon, de-silting of storm water drains and nallahs, ensuring that relief and rescue measures are planned institutionally within the MCGM, with little to no participation with residents and the workforce in the city.

Participatory disaster management

Disaster management plans are often laid out within the corporation, with no community engagement, not only overlooking the city’s potential for participation, but also exposing the corporation to complete failure. Mumbai’s biggest challenge is safely evacuating 5.9 million people during a crisis, when all critical infrastructures are failing. Maybe the challenge is not to get home safe, but to reach a shelter safely and remain there until the crisis has subsided.

The MCGM should undertake five steps in the short-term, to effectively manage crisis situations in Mumbai, to prepare us to take on the global challenge of climate change. This includes:

* Map the workforce (formal and informal labour) in each ward, to understand how many residents will be travelling back home during a disaster.

* Map the number of slum residents, and homeless population most at risk and in need of shelter, for each ward.

* Map religious institutions, schools and other civic institutions that can be used as emergency shelters in each ward. Match these with the number of people in a ward who may require emergency shelter and food. Engage civil society organisations, merchant associations, and resident welfare associations in each ward, to co-develop ward-level disaster management plans.

* Local organisations, community groups, and religious trusts can play a critical role in disseminating information, hosting mock-drills and community meetings, and setting up early warning systems on social media portals. This will help building faith and accountability in a new system in a city as large, dense and complex as Mumbai.

* Finally, develop guidelines for a ward level protocol that details out the disaster relief and recovery plan for each ward, and share these with residents and businesses in the area.

At the time of disasters, people come together in more ways than one, establishing that the foundation for disaster relief and recovery is the social capital, one of Mumbai’s strongest assets. This needs to be used before a disaster, not just during a disaster or afterwards.

Cities the world over must realise and leverage their social capital to shift from a reactive to a proactive disaster management approach. Proactive planning that includes communities and people in the process will help citizens adapt to climate change. The Mumbai example shows that people are willing to help, if the city authorities open up and allow for more participation.

326,326,mumbai,2017,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/in-heavy-rain-mumbais-new-drainage-system-failed-4821443/,31 Aug 2017,"In heavy rain, Mumbai’s new drainage system failed","When Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray briefed the media on Wednesday about the heavy rain that had paralysed the financial capital on Tuesday, he claimed that the city had “experienced unprecedented rainfall and you can’t fight against nature beyond a point.” Parts of Mumbai had received 315 mm of rain in 12 hours. Six people were reported dead, several parts of the commercial capital were plunged into darkness, and thousands of commuters were stranded as public transport — suburban railway and the BEST services — failed to run most of Tuesday. Likening Tuesday’s rains to the July 26, 2005, deluge when Mumbai had received three times as much rain, Thackeray, whose party controls the Mumbai municipality, went on to give a clean chit to drain-cleaning works undertaken before the monsoon.

Mumbai Municipal Commissioner Ajoy Mehta also rejected suggestions that poor drain cleaning and training works were responsible for the flooding. While Thackeray was defiant, Mehta admitted that in some places, the rainwater took more time than anticipated to recede.

Meanwhile, data obtained from the civic body contradicted some claims. It showed that several areas in Central Mumbai and suburban Khar and Bandra were flooded even before the hourly intensity of rain increased to 50 mm, which is also the maximum capacity of the city’s upgraded stormwater drainage system. While the gravity-based drainage network was originally designed for a rainfall of 25 mm per hour, the state government and the civic body spent close to Rs 2,200 crore since 2006, for doubling this capacity. Amid rapid construction activity in the commercial capital, the run-off coefficient — percentage of rainfall that can be drained out from a surface — has also increased from 0.5 to 1. Senior sources admitted that the upgradation exercise was implemented following the July 26, 2005, deluge to “better city’s response to extreme rain events.”

But after eleven years and a spend of Rs 2,200 crore, the upgradation project is nowhere near complete. In 2006, the entire project was expected to cost Rs 1,200 crore. The cost has now risen to over Rs 3,500 crore, said sources.

The civic body has already missed two deadlines — 2011 and 2015 — for the completion of the project. While the work for widening the Mithi river that had overflown in 2005 is nearly complete, Mehta admitted that the work for widening and deepening of drains, and that of construction of new drains as part of the upgradation was incomplete. “We have so far completed 84 per cent of this work,” Mehta said. In 2013, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India had come down heavily on the state government and the civic body over the “inordinate” delay and irregularities in the execution of the project.

Another worrying indicator is the data that the accumulated rainwater in several parts took more time than expected to drain out, again pointing to the “diversion, narrowing, or clogging of drains.” Data shows that rains had eased across Mumbai by 5 pm.

While the civic administration has contended that torrential rain accompanied by strong winds and a high tide of 3.23 metres slowed the rainwater discharge process between 3 pm and 5 pm, several water-logged areas remained inundated till midnight. In fact, in low-lying belts such as Elphinstone, Hindmata junction, and Sion, the civic disaster cell was receiving complaints of waterlogging till early Wednesday morning.

According to data obtained from the India Meteorological Department, the high tide peaked at 4.48 pm. “We had anticipated that the rainwater will recede by 6.30 pm in most parts. But this took much more time.” On the other hand, Mehta, when contacted, argued that the rainwater had receded in most parts by 8.30-9 pm. Civic chief, however, admitted that there was an unexplained delay in the ebbing of rainwater in the three low-lying belts. The civic body had commissioned a dedicated outfall to pump out water accumulated in the flood-prone Hindmata and Elphinstone Road. While the pumping station was operational, the rainwater still did not recede faster. “This is definitely a concern. We’ll look into it,” Mehta said. Besides the clogging of drains and culverts due to garbage and sewage, senior sources said that the angle that the ongoing Metro construction blocking or diverting some drains or culverts in the Bandra Kurla Complex and Elphinstone is being probed.",issue,Mumbai Floods 2017,"Mumbai, India","July 25, 2017","July 26, 2017","['Central Mumbai', 'suburban Khar and Bandra']",315 mm in 12 hours,,6,Thousands of commuters were stranded as public transport — suburban railway and the BEST services — failed to run most of Tuesday.,"The civic body has already missed two deadlines — 2011 and 2015 — for the completion of the project.

We could see the retention wall crumble. We even saw cars parked in the compound being washed away, and we could do nothing but watch as they fell into the river,” said Sakshi Malhotra, a resident of the building in Borivali East.

While the Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party race to seek credit for the proposed rejuvenation of the four rivers in Mumbai, for residents and activists around these rivers, it was a sense of deja vu on Tuesday. By 5 pm, water-logging was witnessed on Western Express Highway (WEH), creating traffic snarls, prompting the traffic department of the Mumbai police to shut the Chhatrapati Shivaji flyover between Dahisar and Borivali, adding to the traffic chaos below.

Meanwhile, musical instruments worth lakhs of rupees were damaged at Achievers Music Academy in Borivali East. “Even after water receded after 8 pm, there was mud and dirt all over the academy. Me and the staff have thrown buckets full of muddy water out, but it has damaged most of the drums and other musical instruments,” said Vijay Worlikar, co-owner of the academy.

Deputy Municipal Commissioner and in-charge of the BMC’s disaster control room, Sudhir Naik, said the Mithi and Dahisar rivers overflowed once on Tuesday afternoon. “Between 5 pm and 6 pm, it rained 70 mm between Andheri and Dahisar. The Poisar and Oshiwara rivers reached the danger mark too, but did not overflow,” said Naik.

According to Naik, around 7.30 pm, the river levels started to slowly recede, but by then the damage had been done. The retention wall built by the BMC after the 2005 deluge collapsed, as the river overflowed, flooding housing societies in Borivali and Dahisar. “The Chhatrapati Shivaji flyover had to be shut down as there was water-logging in Dahisar East. The Western Express Highway (WEH) in Borivali and Dahisar was also water-logged as the river overflowed,” said Harish Pande, activist and local resident. Pande added, “The traffic snarl was bad, people were stuck on WEH for hours.” According to Pande, Reliance Energy also disconnected power supply to all the buildings along the Dahisar river.

The Dahisar and Poisar rivers originate from Tulsi lake. “Generations of Mumbaikars don’t know them as rivers, they look at it as smelly ‘nallahs’ that flood in the monsoon. The Chitale commission set up to recommend remedies following the 2005 deluge, said the BMC in its Development Plans deliberately refers to the rivers as nallahs, so that river laws don’t apply to them. Under our campaign River March, we have been fighting to get these four rivers rejuvenated. However, neither the BMC nor the state government seems serious about it. Tuesday’s flood is yet another eyeopener,” said Gopal Jhaveri, resident of Borivali and co-founder of River March movement.

Sixty-year-old Ashok Rajbhatt has been bedridden for almost a decade after being paralysed. Rajbhatt could not move out of his home in Dahisar gaothan on Tuesday when water gushed into his house. The two-and-half-hour ordeal left him in shock. “I could have died, Ganpati Bappa saved me. I could not move, my wife was helpless and couldn’t get me out. After almost two hours people gathered and managed to move me out. The entire area was in waist deep water,” said Rajbhatt.

Another resident of the gaothan, Kalpana Bhoir said, “We have seen this after almost 12 years now. It first happened in 1983, when we had to leave everything and get out of the gaothan. The damage then was very less as most of us did not have any high-end appliance. After that we faced a similar situation in 2005.

In the last two months, more than 1,000 people have been killed in flooding events across India, southern Nepal and northern Bangladesh. Some 40 million more have seen their homes, businesses or crops destroyed.

Mumbai was especially hard hit, with water swamping offices, schools and roads and about 60 people killed — 33 alone in Thursday’s collapse of a 117-year-old apartment building whose foundation had been weakened by the flooding.

“The city was brought to its knees,” said Darryl D’Monte, a Mumbai-based environmentalist.

Residents in a neighbourhood near the Barker Reservoir return to their homes to collect belongings August 31, 2017 in Houston, Texas. The neighborhoods surrounding the reservoir are still experiencing severe flooding due to the accumulation of historic levels of rainfall, though floodwaters are beginning to recede in many parts of the city. (AFP)

Such tragedies happen almost every year in South Asia. The amount of rain Hurricane Harvey dumped on Houston over the past week was unprecedented not only for the city but also for the continental US. Mumbai, however, experienced similar flooding just 12 years ago, and several major Indian cities have been inundated since then, including Kolkata in 2007, Hyderabad in 2008, Srinagar in 2014 and Chennai in 2015.

The death toll is often high, as it is this monsoon season, because of factors that include inadequate housing. In Mumbai alone, some 3 million people are crammed into low-lying slums and have few places to flee to when floods hit.

Experts say Indian officials are doing little to reduce the risks. Instead, they allow new construction, paving over floodplains, denuding forests and testing river banks.

Mumbai authorities have ignored plans to upgrade the city’s British-era drainage system, clear drains of plastic debris and install pumping stations and flood gates to get any floodwaters out, D’Monte said.

“In most cities, lakes, ponds and even wide-open spaces acted as sponges to absorb excess rainfall. These have all disappeared from our cities and towns as water bodies are filled up and buildings come up in their place,” said Chandra Bhushan of the Centre for Science and Environment, an environment think tank in New Delhi.

“We are becoming very good at weather forecasting. But we are very poor in putting that forecast information into decisions and actions,” he said.

For north Indian farmer Avdesh Singh, predictions are of no consequence. Days ago, Singh watched as his home and fields sown with lentil crops were submerged in the village of Narayanpur Jaisingh, in state of Uttar Pradesh. He had managed to flee with the five other members of his family to a nearby highway, where they camped in the open for five days before being rescued.

“This was a dry area. We yearned for rain. But not this way,” he said. “Our world has turned topsy-turvy and there’s no going back.”

Scientists have warned that flooding events will only become more frequent, as climate change brings stronger storms and makes rainfall more erratic — a key danger for those living along both the Bay of Bengal and the Gulf of Mexico, which are considered “hurricane alleys” for the strong storms that barrel through.

Already, average temperatures across India have risen some 1.8 degrees Celsius in the last century. That extra heat increases evaporation, which makes storm clouds heavier. Higher temperatures are also increasing snow and ice melt in the Himalayas, sending more water rushing to the plains.

“Extreme rainfall events are going to be a part of our lives. If that is the case, how do we design our cities?” Bhushan said. “The current chaotic, business-as-usual urban sprawl is a recipe for disaster.”

In addition, year-round farming is clogging irrigation canals and widespread deforestation has contributed to soil erosion, reducing the ability of land to absorb water. Those were key reasons for India’s deadliest flooding of this monsoon season.

Nearly 520 people were killed last month in northern Bihar state, where silt-filled rivers couldn’t cope with this year’s high volume of water, said Dinesh Mishra, an environmentalist who has studied Bihar’s flood patterns for years. He blamed the state’s decision in the 1950s to build embankments along those rivers for tripling the area now prone to flooding.

“Instead of constructing these embankments, the government should have pushed ahead with a plan to remove the silt from the rivers,” he said.

These problems are not confined to India. Recent floods in neighbouring Nepal killed 149 people and left 27 missing, while also damaging or destroying almost a quarter of a million homes.

There, too, experts blamed deforestation and land degradation for a tragedy made worse by a lack of preparation and an institutional inability to cope.

“Some people were given some warning about the flood, but they were not told where to go in such disasters,” said geologist Shree Kamal Dwivedi with Nepal’s Department of Water Induced Disaster Management in Kathmandu.

It should be urgent now for authorities to figure out how to cope with future flooding, he said, given that “global warming and climate change is contributing to the change in rainfall patterns” and threatening to make things worse.

Many governments in India, Bangladesh and Nepal say they don’t have the money to make major changes. Still, there have been some improvements to flood preparations, including test versions of early flood warning systems and better protocols for disaster response. But experts say officials need to heed those warnings, and police and soldiers need disaster management training if they are going to continue to be deployed for rescue efforts.

In Mumbai, there is obvious room for improvement.

On Aug. 24, weather forecasters predicted heavy rain was on the way. But the warning by local authorities to close down schools and asking people to stay home came five days later.

By then, no warning was necessary. The roads were already waist-deep in water.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Severe flooding has devastated communities and destroyed crops in India, Nepal and Bangladesh, with NGOs warning of food shortages and the risk of disease.

In Bangladesh, where the floods are thought to be the most severe in 100 years, more than a third of the country has been submerged. Najibullah Hameem, chief of field office for the UN children’s agency, Unicef, in Bangladesh, told the Guardian on Monday that water levels are now going down, but that aid workers are running out of crucial supplies needed to protect communities from disease. At least 115 people have died and more than 5.7 million are affected.

“The need is huge and our resources are limited. We cannot respond to all of what people require in this situation,” he said. “[Agencies had made plans based] on last year, when the flood was not serious like this. We had not expected the number of communities that are currently affected.”

Last week, most government departments had run out of medicines and items such as jerry cans, tarpaulin and water purification tablets. Supplies have since been replenished, but are still short of demand.

Survivors of the flood are returning to find their homes destroyed, Hameem said. “In terms of water level the situation is improving but there might be rain again, and if so the waters will go up again. They need to repair their houses – some are completely washed out. We are expecting more medical issues and disease.”

Unicef is trying to collect information on children affected by the floods, who may have been separated from their families, or be at risk of drowning and snakebites. In four of the districts most severely affected, all schools are closed, leaving children unable to finish their exams, which are held over the summer months.

Mark Pierce, country director for Save the Children in Bangladesh, warned that the central and southern areas of the country now face devastation as flood waters flow from the north.

“An enormous volume of water has to pass through the country, and people need to take care, stay away from flood waters and evacuate their homes as necessary. The humanitarian situation remains extremely serious and will be for some time.



“The sheer scale of this crisis means there still isn’t enough food or clean drinking water. More than half a million homes have been damaged while over 400,000 hectares of farmland was destroyed. We’re doing all we can to help, but much more assistance is urgently needed,” said Pierce.

In the Indian state of Assam, which borders Bangladesh, at least 180 people have been killed in the past few weeks. “With the floods washing away everything … there is not even a trace of our small thatched hut,” said Lakshmi Das, a mother of three, living in Kaliabor, Assam.



“We do not even have a second pair of clothes to wear. The government is not providing any aid.”

Ravikant Upadhyay, team leader of Assam flood response for Care India, said communities have been devastated. “The embankment of rivers in many areas have been breached, forcing over 400 families to stay in extremely unhygienic conditions. Most people have lost everything including important documents. Schools are submerged under eight feet of water. Overall, the flood survivors are very worried and in dire need of support,” he said.

In the eastern Indian state of Bihar, at least 253 people lost their lives. Heavy rains have destroyed crops, roads and disrupted power supplies.

Thomas Chandy, CEO of Save the Children in India, warned of a secondary health crisis as flood waters began to retreat in some areas.

“Even though we’re seeing flood waters receding in some parts, it provides little respite as the mammoth recovery operation is only just beginning,” Chandy said.

“One of the big challenges is preventing potential outbreaks of disease like cholera or diarrhoea, which is an increased risk at this time. A lot of water sources have been contaminated by the floods, and many children are living in damp conditions that are conducive to getting sick.”

In Nepal, 141 people are confirmed dead, while more than 38,000 households have been severely affected by floods.

Madhav P Dhakal, response and recovery coordinator for Care Nepal, said the NGO is handing out “dignity kits” (hygiene and sanitary materials for women), ready-to-cook food and water purifiers. “All the water taps were completely covered by the flooded water, so there is a big need for water purifiers,” he said.



Aid workers are also providing health education and running health camps to prevent disease outbreaks. Dhakal added: “Mosquito nets are in high need because of the water level in the areas and high chances of malaria and other mosquito bites communicable diseases. Symptoms of skin diseases, eye problems and fevers have been recorded among the flood-affected people.”

The heavy rains have also hit Kaziranga national park in India’s Assam state. The park hosts two-thirds of the world’s population of endangered Indian one-horned rhinoceroses.

Around 225 dead animals have been recovered since 12 August, including 15 rhinos and a Bengal tiger.",flood,South Asia floods,"India, Nepal, Bangladesh",12 August 2017,20 August 2017,"Bangladesh, India, Nepal",1000 mm,$10 billion,800+,24 million affected,Food shortages and disease outbreaks are expected,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The resultant outrage, inconvenience, and suffering are something of a tradition, with successive governments getting pilloried for their lack of preparedness despite the regularity with which the monsoon paralyses India’s financial capital. Some things never change.

The latest act was on August 29, when Mumbai ground to a near-complete halt once again after parts of the city received 298 mm of rain within a nine-hour period. Five people have died so far, and more rain is expected.

The city’s inability to weather such downpours is a result of a combination of the failure to improve its drainage system and the unbridled development that has stymied the region’s natural capacity to absorb heavy rainfall. The latter, in particular, has mostly been overlooked. As journalist Darryl D’Monte noted in Scroll.in:

…Mumbai’s major nullahs form a vein-like network that can extend for an astounding 300 km. These could have functioned effectively to drain water out of the city. But this is a natural legacy that the city authorities have abused, with the reckless sanctioning of building after building, in brazen collusion with builders and venal bureaucrats. By indiscriminately dumping waste in open drains, citizens have also contributed to choking them.

To better understand the impact of the decades of haphazard development, Quartz pulled out some satellite maps of Mumbai from 1988 and 2017:

Mumbai is essentially a peninsula jutting into the Arabian Sea. Since the 1980s, when a little over eight million called it home, the city’s population has more than doubled. That’s led to rapid urbanisation of the surrounding areas, as well as encroachment of the mangroves on the city’s edges.

A close examination of mangroves around the Thane (the finger of water on the right) and Malad creeks (the green patch on the left) reveal how the city has expanded. Mangrove forests, found at the intersection of land and sea, are natural and vital flood barriers, especially as storms become more erratic and severe due to climate change.

More proof of their destruction is available further north of Mumbai, where the area around the Manori creek (on the left) has been massively encroached upon. Mangroves at the mouth of the Desai Khadi river (bottom, right), too, have met with a similar fate, with areas being extensively built upon in the last 30 years.

Then, there’s the Mithi river, the thread of blue at the centre of the image, right under the X-shaped runways of the Mumbai airport. It originates in the hills around the Sanjay Gandhi National Park and travels nearly 18 kilometres to drain into the sea. Mithi is Mumbai’s natural storm drain, particularly during heavy rains. Over the years, though, it has become a veritable sewer, choked with domestic and industrial waste. The wetlands along the river (immediately south of the airport), too, have disappeared since the late 1980s.

It’s a story of maximum destruction in the Maximum City.

Imperceptible rise in sea levels and changes in weather patterns is making Mumbai and the west coast of India more vulnerable to severe cyclonic storms

Many older citizens of Mumbai vividly recall the cyclone that hit the metropolis in 1948. As strong winds and rain lashed the city incessantly, the sky was completely overcast for a few days and a sense of menace pervaded the city. Trees were uprooted in large numbers and there was extensive property damage.

Indelible memories of that cataclysmic event came back to the mind as this reporter attended a full-day workshop on Cyclones & Storm Surges: Building a Framework for Evaluating the Climate Risk to Mumbai, organised by Columbia University’s Global Centre in Mumbai recently. It was led by Adam Sobel, a meteorologist who heads a new Initiative on Weather Risk and Climate at the New York-based university.

Sobel is familiar to some Indian readers because he is cited by Amitav Ghosh in his recent non-fiction book, The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable, for detailing how Hurricane Sandy, which hit New York in 2012, was frequently described as an “unprecedented” phenomenon and wasn’t expected, like many repercussions of climate change.

Sobel wrote a book titled Storm Surge: Hurricane Sandy, Our Changing Climate, and Extreme Weather of the Past and Future in 2014. A surge is the rise in sea level as the winds whipped up by a storm propel ocean water on to the shore. He states how losing one’s life to a hurricane is “something that happens in faraway places” and Ghosh began to wonder if a storm of this magnitude could hit Mumbai, also a coastal megacity and a commercial hub, and contacted Sobel. That started the New Yorker thinking.

In 2013, Mumbai was listed by the journal Nature Climate Change as the fifth coastal city in the world to be most affected by flooding in the future, measured by economic losses. The first four are Guangzhou, Miami, New York-Newark and New Orleans.

Link with climate change

In his presentation in Mumbai, Sobel raised the possibility of linking Mumbai being the landfall in the event of a severe storm in the future and low-lying areas being flooded with climate change. He hastened to assert that investigations were at a very preliminary level and his team was embarking on a two-year study. They displayed a hypothetical model of how a cyclone would impact Mumbai and will resort extensively to modelling to assess possible impacts.

According to a recent unpublished paper by R. Mani Murali from the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) in Goa, Mumbai has some coastal areas as low as 6-8 metres above sea level, with an average elevation of 14 metres. It is well known that Bombay originally consisted of seven islands, which were reclaimed. Many low-lying areas in what is still known as the island city are those that were inadequately reclaimed from the 19th century onwards.

At the Mumbai workshop, the former Director General of the India Meteorological Department, R. R. Kelkar, outlined how the first reclamations were by a private company, followed by the Bombay Port Trust and lastly by the state government till campaigns by environmentalists halted it in 1974.

In July 2005, Mumbai got a premonition of what lies ahead if a storm hits it when 94.4 cm of rain fell in 24 hours in the northern suburbs, while the island city was relatively unscathed. The official fact-finding committee, headed by the well-known hydrologist Madhav Chitale, published maps identifying vulnerable areas throughout Mumbai.

While all experts point out that one can’t attribute cyclones and storms in the Arabian sea directly to climate change, it is incontrovertible that as temperatures rise both in the ocean and on land, with each year breaking new records, weather patterns throughout the globe are getting erratic and the possibility of torrential downpours, accompanied by fierce winds, is increasing. See: Indian Ocean warming: a curious case

Cyclonic activity will rise

According to Ghosh, the most recent research shows that the Arabian Sea is one of the world’s regions where cyclonic activity is likely to rise. He cites a 2012 paper by a Japanese research team, which predicts a 46% rise in tropical cyclones by the end of the next century, with a corresponding 31% decrease in the Bay of Bengal. 2015 was the first year in which the Arabian Sea is known to have more storms than the Bay of Bengal, while the latter has historically been hit by far more and fiercer storms.

Cyclones are more likely to occur during and after the monsoons. American researchers show that cyclonic activity in the Arabian Sea is likely to intensify due to the suspended particulate matter over the Indian subcontinent and its surrounding waters, all of which contribute to altering the region’s wind patterns.

In an article in the Times of India newspaper in 2015, Sobel wrote: “Between 1998 and 2001, three cyclones struck the west coast of the subcontinent, not far from Mumbai. Just in the past few weeks, Yemen was struck by two cyclones in the space of a single week. One of them, Chapala, was the strongest to make landfall there in known history. El Nino may be a factor this year, but the unusual Arabian Sea cyclone activity has been going on for a longer period.”

Ghosh adds that these three cyclones claimed over 17,000 lives. “Then in 2007, the Arabian Sea generated its strongest ever recorded storm: Cyclone Gonu, a Category 5 hurricane, which hit Oman, Iran and Pakistan in June that year, causing widespread damage,” he writes.

Because these have taken place north of India, they didn’t attract much attention. However, there were two severe cyclones, which hit the Gujarat coast between 1972 and 2015. The 1998 event was very severe, with over 10,000 deaths and losses amounting to $290 million.

Preparing for storms

Experts believe that given this increasing risk, coastal cities must prepare for such eventualities. Sobel pointed out that the administration should identify which areas are prone to flooding, which is already available for Mumbai.

Secondly, what is the threat to lives and property? As many as 447 people lost their lives in the city in 2005, as detailed by the report titled Mumbai Marooned: An Enquiry into the Mumbai Floods by the Concerned Citizens’ Commission, on which this writer served.

The total economic loss was put at INR 28 billion (USD 41 million), of which INR 10 billion was of infrastructure. The airport, which was on reclaimed land where the Mithi River, was bent twice at right angles to permit runways, was inundated for three days.

One has only to realise that Mumbai — and Chennai, which was hit by cyclones in 2015 and 2016 – are hubs for international IT firms and can’t tolerate a disruption in communications.

Evacuation plans

Evacuation plans should be put in place. In 2005, no Mumbaikars could access higher ground because the roads and railway tracks were under water. Boats, which could have worked, were not provided for rescue or relief.

While the influence of climate change on cyclonic storms lies in the realm of uncertainty, the same doesn’t hold true of sea level rise. Due to the melting of polar ice caps because of global warming, ocean levels throughout the world are rising.

At the launch of his book in Mumbai, Ghosh unsettled his audience by pointing out that some of the most expensive real estate in the world lies along the west coast of Mumbai. According to the unpublished paper by Murali of NIO, as much as 40% of Greater Mumbai – a staggering 190 sq km – could be under water within a century.

“Going by previous studies by NIO researchers, we considered a 3 mm rise (annually) in sea levels along Mumbai’s coast. That, coupled with factors such as natural calamities and tidal changes, will result in an approximate increase of 3 metres,” Murali told the Hindustan Times newspaper.

Another multidisciplinary study in 2012 by 220 Indian scientists from 120 institutes forming part of India’s second communication to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) stated: “It is estimated that sea level rise by 3.5 to 34.6 inches (8.89 – 87.88 cm) between 1990 and 2100 would result in saline coastal groundwater, endangering wetlands and inundating valuable land and coastal communities. The most vulnerable stretches along the western Indian coast are Khambat and Kutch in Gujarat, Mumbai and parts of the Konkan coast and south Kerala.”

Ironically, such submergence would hit two extremes — the very wealthy living in high-rises along the coast and the poorest shanty dwellers who live on mudflats, given the astronomical real estate values. Mumbai is unique in that nearly 60% of its 13 million inhabitants are slum dwellers who, however, only occupy around 9% of the area.

Rising sea levels

The geography department of SP College in Pune has been studying sea level rise in the Konkan coast from Dahanu, just north of Mumbai, to Vengurla to the south. Over 20 years, levels have risen by 5-6 cm. On a full moon night in 2009, the high tide rose by 4 cm near Ratnagiri, which was much higher than previously recorded. In recent years, sea levels were rising at a much faster pace.

A 5-6 cm rise has led to the ingress of sea water up to 1 km inland, eroding beaches, harming mangroves and coconut and cashew plantations. The geographers find that tidal patterns are getting increasingly erratic.

The standard response of the authorities only when the situation gets too serious is to construct bunds to keep the sea at bay. These cost as much as Rs 60,000 per metre and are only built at certain stretches.

In their extensively researched 2016 book, How the World Breaks: Life in Catastrophe’s Path, from the Caribbean to Siberia, Stan and Paul Cox cite the 2005 Mumbai floods. “The sheer scale of this disaster and the fact that it brought an entire metropolis, India’s biggest and richest, to its knees was enough to send storm drainage straight to the top of Mumbai’s long list of urgent issues,” they write.

The authors quote Aromar Revi, Director of the Indian Institute of Human Settlements in Bangalore: “It was clear to many million people in Mumbai that life may never be quite the same again. An exceptional rainstorm finally put to rest the long-prevailing myth of Mumbai’s indestructible resilience to all kinds of shocks.”

They conclude on a sombre but truthful note: “In the minds of many, an event that overwhelming should have served as a wake-up call. But while it unmasked Mumbai’s increasing vulnerability, the flood appeared to stiffen the city’s resistance to any policy changes that might undermine its famed moneymaking prowess.”

“Heedless maldevelopment has continued. Meanwhile, sea level rise combined with increased rainfall will dramatically increase the extent and depth of flooding, doubling the likelihood that a flood on the scale of the 2005 catastrophe will recur.”",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

In all, ten flights were cancelled. Many airlines said that several flights took off or landed with some delay, with reports of many passengers failing to show up having been stuck on the roads and those landing in the city struggling to get cabs to reach their destinations.

Operations at Juhu airport remained suspended from 3.30 pm to 6 pm due to low visibility, officials said. “Due to low visibility, flights were running fifteen to twenty minutes late. The landing operations had to be curtailed due to traffic congestion. The operation is on but there is a no show from passengers too,” an official from Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) said.

“Take off and landings of flights were delayed by at least twenty minutes throughout the day due to heavy rains and poor visibility. The excessive speed of winds also led to suspension of landing operations at the airport between 4.30 pm and 6 pm. The main runway remained operational and no water-logging was witnessed. Till Tuesday evening, flights continued to remain late by at least twenty minutes,” a senior Air Traffic Control (ATC) official said, who also added that the airport is operational now.

Officials from Jet Airways said that their two flights between Delhi and Mumbai had to be cancelled. An official statement from the Indigo airline read, “Due to the incessant rainfall in Mumbai, three Indigo flights, 6E-453 Coimbatore-Mumbai, 6E-5924 Guwahati-Mumbai and 6E-1708 Doha-Mumbai had to be diverted to Ahmedabad which departed for Mumbai only after the weather was clear. At IndiGo, customer service is core to our business. In such circumstances our endeavour is to keep our customers informed about the status of the flight,” an official statement from the airline said.

Officials from Air India said that one of their flights was cancelled and two flights diverted to Ahmedabad. “Nearly six flights have been delayed because crew movement is too slow, as pick up vans are not able to reach the destination. Most of the Mumbai flights inbound and outbound were affected since morning. Flights have been delayed by more than 30 minutes,” the spokesperson of Air India said.

“In view of inclement weather in Mumbai, applicable penalties of re-issuance, date change, no-show, cancellation & refund charges stand waived on all tickets issued on before 29.08.2017 for travel to and from Mumbai on 29th August, 2017,” the Air India spokesperson said.

Passengers complained that they were stuck in Mumbai airport for a long time due to unavailability of cab services. “I reached home only three hours after departure at Mumbai as no cab services were available. Our flight was delayed by 45 minutes in landing which further caused a delay.

Devotees determined to get a glimpse of their favourite deity seemed unfazed by the weather and traffic conditions, turning up in large numbers to seek blessings of the celebrated Lalbaugcha Raja, according to organisers. “Over 10,000 people gathered here today and many of them were stranded office-goers. We provided food and water for everyone,” said Balasaheb Kamble of the Lalbaugcha Raja Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal.

Ganesh Pawaskar came for a darshan from Dadar, despite the heavy rain. “Since we left early from work, we headed here. Though there was a long queue we did not get wet because everything was organised well,” he said. On the fifth day of the festivities, when many small Ganpati idols installed at homes – besides a few idols of large mandals – are immersed (visarjan) in the sea, the attendance on Tuesday was low but spirits were high. Thousands with residential idols set out to various beaches for immersion. Others decided to host Bappa a little longer hoping weather conditions would become favourable.

Anticipating heavy rainfall, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had increased the number of lifeguards at Girgaum Chowpatty, who were responsible for taking the idols into the sea. “The sea was extremely rough through most of the afternoon and evening. While usually we have around 40 trained lifeguards who take the idols into the sea, we had deployed an additional 20. Due to the heavy rain, very few people turned up,” said Kishore Kshirsagar, assistant municipal commissioner of D ward.

He added that since the sea was rough, none of the boats or floats were taken out into the sea until the rains stopped late evening. “On the fifth day, mostly residential idols are brought for immersion which can be handled by the lifeguards easily without a boat. We constantly advised people to stay well behind and allow the trained lifeguards to carry their idols,” he said, adding that majority of the people came in the evening after the rains had receded. Kshirsagar said that till 6 pm, only around 70 idols were immersed at Girgaum Chowpatty.

Among the many lifeguards was 30-year-old Arvind Jadhav who spent the day immersing idols. A resident of Diva in Thane, Jadhav has been on duty since 2 pm and worked through the hours of high tide when the sea was tough and everyone was advised to stay indoors. “Though I didn’t realise that it would rain so heavily that all trains would stop functioning, I had a feeling that there would be heavy showers today which is why I left my house at 8 am. My family has been worried and has been calling me all day,” he said. Jadhav has been a lifeguard since 2011, and has a wife and two children. Since majority of the idols brought were small residential ones, Jadhav said they are placing upto 10 of the idols onto the float. “Each time we have taken out the float about 200-250 metres into the sea and I have made about 30 trips till now and there are more families approaching now. Initially, it was dull, but now the environment is lively. Even though people are slightly worried about returning home, they are enjoying the festival,” he said.

The beaches at Versova and Juhu saw bigger crowds though they were largely immersing residential idols. “We had posted around five lifeguards at Juhu beach and two lifeguards at Versova. People came in a staggered manner and most of them had come in the late evening after the rains had stopped,” said Prashant Gaikwad, assistant municipal commissioner K West ward. Gaikwad said that until 8 pm, 12 public pandal idols and 376 residential idols were immersed at Versova and 194 residential idols were immersed in artificial ponds.

Despite the intense rain, the Nimbalkar family went ahead to immerse their deity at Juhu Beach. “Since we live near the beach, we did not face any difficulty in conducting the visarjan. We enjoyed the rain and our family members went into the sea to immerse the idol. While there were life guards on the beach there were very few families who had come there for immersion,” said Sunita Nimbalkar, a Juhu resident.

Some families refrained from conducting visarjan owing to the heavy rains. “We will conduct the immersion on the seventh day. We thought it is better not to risk someone’s life for this,” said Manasi Hardikar, a Girgaum resident. “Few pandals at Mahim and some families could not go ahead with the immersion because of the rain. They plan to do it by tomorrow if the roads clear. However, there will be increased crowds on the seventh day (Gauri Visarjan) with families and pandals both heading to the immersion spots,” said Naresh Dahibavkar, co-ordinator, Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti.

Since the July 2005 floods of Mumbai, much attention has been paid to how encroachments and urban

have choked the Mithi

, leading to more flooding in the surrounding areas.

But the flood-prone zone around the

river, which runs from the Sanjay Gandhi National Park down to Malad creek, has also expanded in the past half decade for similar reasons, shows a new study from IIT Bombay that includes a flood

analysis for the

.

Between 1966-2009, there was a 74.84% increase in built-up area in the catchment zone of the Oshiwara river.The pace of urban growth was greater after 2001—around 31% increase in built-up area in the eight years between 2001-2009 compared with 43.5% in the 35 years between 1966 and 2001.In the same four-decade period, open spaces in the catchment zone reduced by 42.8% and water bodies by 62%.The increased built-up area has been accompanied by a rise in the extent of flood inundation, with the downstream part of the catchment zone more vulnerable than upstream, found IIT researchers P E Zope, T I Eldho and V Jothiprakash. The area at high risk has expanded too.The area in the highly hazardous zone increased by 64.29% while that falling in less hazardous one declined by 32%, shows the analysis. The total flood-hazard area increased by 22.3%.The increased flood hazard is partly due to development on the river’s flood plains, said Eldho, a professor at IIT Bombay’s civil engineering department. Detention and holding ponds have also shrunk or been built over and the sides of the river have been encroached upon, narrowing the river into barely a nullah in some stretches, he noted.The Bandra-Kurla Complex , for instance, was built over a flood plain and a detention pond, contributing to the disastrous flooding on 26/7. A previous study by the same researchers had found that the built-up area around the Mithi river had risen by almost 60% and open spaces reduced by 40%.Despite the massive jump in built-up area, the volume and flow of run-off increased only marginally, found researchers. This seems surprising because urbanization usually reduces the availability of permeable surface to absorb water, leading to a great increase in rainfall run-off--which, in turn, leads to more frequent flooding. As earth gets covered with concrete, there’s less soil to sponge up the water.But because Mumbai is built on reclaimed islands, the water table is high and the marine clay soil already saturated, said Eldho. “In Chennai or Delhi’s soil, the same level of urban development would have increased run-off much more,” he said.That makes the preservation of detention ponds such as salt pans and mangroves all the more important, said Eldho, especially since global warming is expected to increase intense rainfall events in the region in future.The IIT study was published recently in Catena, an international journal on soil science, and is part of Zope’s PhD work. He and others first analyzed land use changes in the catchment zone using maps and satellite data. They then modelled the impact of these changes on rainfall runoff using a century of data from the Colaba weather station and half a century data from Santa Cruz’s. Finally, they generated flood inundation and hazard maps for different rainfall scenarios.Researchers hope their work will ultimately help in city disaster planning and flood mitigation. What’s really needed, said Eldho, is to make a flood hazard map for the whole of Mumbai that is integrated with the new Development Plan.“Citizens can see if builder projects are coming up in a flood hazard zone or take out the appropriate insurance for their existing homes,” he said.",issue,2005 Mumbai floods,"Mumbai, India","July 26, 2005","July 27, 2005",Mumbai city and suburbs,944 mm (37.1 in),$2.6 billion,"1,000+","Widespread flooding, damage to infrastructure, loss of life","The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage, and encroachment on floodplains.

Twelve of the 17 passengers were identified on Wednesday. A family of five who live in the city are among them.

Even after hours of searching, the rescue teams were unable recover anyone suspected to have been washed away. The three teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), two helicopters each from the Navy and the Indian Coast Guard along with local river rafting teams were carrying out the search and rescue operation.

Locals, however, found the bodies of two men 8 km downstream from the site of the collapse. State authorities, including the Raigad collector and the state public works minister, said the bodies were yet to be identified.

Stalled traffic from the collapsed bridge was diverted to a parallel bridge, the collector said.

Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis visited the spot and ordered an inquiry into the incident. “The inquiry will reveal if there were any lapses on the part of the administration while assessing the condition of bridge that collapsed,” he said, adding that the search operation would continue till all the missing persons were found.

A 300-kg magnet mounted on crane was being used by the NDRF to trace the exact location of vehicles washed away in the incident.

“Various agencies are involved in rescue operation in the 30-kilometre stretch of the river. However so far no vehicle has been found during search operation,” said Suvez Haque, superintendent of police, Raigad district.

Inclement weather made the operations harder.

According to MSRTC officials, the incident happened around 11:30 pm. They received information of the mishap when a driver of a Mumbai-bound bus saw a state transport bus being swept away in the current and alerted MSRTC control.

“Appearantly two buses, Jaigad-Mumbai and Rajapur-Borivali, are suspected to have washed away in the flood when the bridge collapsed along with some private vehicles. Seventeen passengers, nine and eight each, were travelling in the two buses,”said VV Ratnaparakhi, general manager (traffic), MSRTC.

The corporation has been unable to contact their staff on the buses.

MSRTC is the biggest public transport undertaking in the country with more than 17,000 buses ferrying 60 lakh passengers daily.

Rescue efforts afoot

Ranjitsingh Deol, vice chairman and managing director of MSRTC, said their officials had reached the spot and were assisting the NDRF team and other authorities in search and rescue operations.

Anupam Srivastava, commandant, NDRF (Pune), said, “The first team comprising of 40 men consisting of divers, swimmers, boats and equipment necessary for rescue operations was dispatched at 5 am in the morning. Three more teams -- two from Mumbai and one from Pune, each consisting of 40 men, have been asked to join operations.”

The Coast Guard dispatched a Chetak helicopter for search sorties at about 8:15 am to locate people who were swept away in the river’s current. A Seaking 42C all weather aircraft with diving team is being launched by the Indian Navy, a defence spokesperson said.

Additional superintendent of police (Raigad), Sanjay Patil, said 35 professional divers were combing the area on five boats and two kayaks. He added one helicopter from the coast guard and Navy each had joined the aerial survey.

For information on the missing persons, one may contact the toll free number 1077 or call on 02141 - 222118.

343,343,mumbai,2016,https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/30/story-cities-11-reclamation-mumbai-bombay-megacity-population-density-flood-risk,30 Mar 2016,"Story of cities #11: the reclamation of Mumbai – from the sea, and its people?","Of all the ways in which Mumbai has been called a city of dreams, at least one is literal. It is sometime in the late 18th century, and the engineers of the East India Company in Bombay are losing a battle against the sea. They’re dumping boatloads of stone into Worli creek to build an embankment, but it has collapsed once and it collapses again.

That’s when an engineer named Ramji Shivji Prabhu has a dream: the goddess Mahalakshmi and two others inform him their stone idols lie submerged in the creek. Can some space be made for them on land? Prabhu has them fished out and installed in a shrine built nearby on land gifted by the administration. The wall holds.

This story was found in a bakhar, a Marathi literary form that recounts colourful histories, and may seem a little fanciful for our times. But that embankment – the Hornby Vellard, completed in 1784 – was very real and can be said to have given shape to the modern city of Mumbai (the official name since 1995). It was built at the initiative of William Hornby, then governor of Bombay, and over the next few decades was followed by the construction of causeways to link the seven islets separated by sea and swamp.

The city of Bombay grew through the conjuring up of land from the sea. Embankments were built, hills were flattened, the rubble dumped into marsh. Along with the suburbs that came later, metropolitan Mumbai today crams more than 12 million people into an area of 438 sq km, a solid chunk of land jutting out from the Indian peninsula into the Arabian sea.

“We’ve created a city out of water,” says Mariam Dossal, retired professor of history at the University of Mumbai, who has studied reclamations during the British period. “It was a major feat. The subsequent development of Bombay owes a huge amount to the reclamations.”

The seven islets – their anglicised names being Colaba, Old Woman’s Island, Bombay, Mazgaon, Parel, Mahim and Worli – came to the British in 1661 as part of the dowry of Charles II, who married into the Portuguese royal family. “It came as a surprise,” Dossal says. “Charles wasn’t sure at all about how much land he had got, or where the islands were.”

After initial confusion about Bombay possibly being located somewhere near Brazil, the British took possession in 1665 – whereupon, Dossal says, “They realised it was not even 18 square miles of land, and that communication from one island to another was a problem.” Bombay was quickly palmed off to the East India Company for a paltry £10 a year – which suited the company just fine, as it was looking for a new base on the west coast of India.

The company understood that more land would mean more revenue, and reclamation was a hot topic across Europe – with large projects having been undertaken earlier in the century in Holland and the fens of East Anglia. The seven islets, separated only by shallows during high tides, looked ideal for recovering land, but the effort and investment required was still daunting – even if, according to Dossal, the Portuguese may already have attempted to build some causeways, meaning the seven islets were by then likely only four.

An early challenge to reclamation was the “Great Breach” between Bombay and Worli. In 1685, the deputy governor reported: “Concerning the overflowne lands, there hath been a thorough inspection but we find it not feasible to stop the great gap.” Solutions seem to have been found by the early 18th century, however, and soon prison convicts were being marshalled to fill the breach.

Decades later, the Hornby Vellard strengthened the existing mud embankment across the breach. Completed in 1784 with the help of a certain dreaming engineer, in time it allowed more than 700 acres of low-lying land to be drained for agriculture and the city’s expansion to the north. Today, the area boasts some of Mumbai’s most sought after addresses.

Several other breakwaters and causeways followed, and by 1838 the island city of Bombay was contiguous. With the first comprehensive plan to reclaim land and grow the city’s boundaries established soon after, private companies entered the fray; it proved such roaring business (for a while) that reclamation companies accounted for 95% of the paid-up capital of all those registered between 1863 and 1865. More land in Bombay became habitable and the terrain flattened out as, one by one, hills were broken up and dumped into the sea.

“These were very ambitious projects,” Dossal says of the reclamations. “They required great technical skill, engineering expertise and financial management.” In the archives, she has found meticulous estimates of the costs involved, factoring in stores, foundries, barges, the levelling of hills, and how the workmen would be paid – including “Chinese stonemasons, whose rate was higher”.

But perhaps the scale of planning and effort is best illustrated by a failed reclamation project. Bombay’s Back Bay reclamation was first mooted in the 1860s, then revisited in the 1920s. More than a thousand acres of land was to be created by building a seawall more than 6km in length with rock blasted from a hill some 30km away. A dredging craft would excavate 25 million cubic yards of mud.

When work began, however, the mud was not as soft as anticipated so the dredger’s hourly capacity was lower, meaning the project would be much delayed and flagrantly overshoot its budget. A council member and lawyer, Khurshed Nariman, led a gleeful attack against the “Back Bay Bungle” in the press and courts, accusing British administrators of incompetence and financial wrongdoing.

The project was shelved with only parts of the Back Bay reclaimed, but it was still enough to give Mumbai one of its iconic landmarks – the seafront promenade of Marine Drive (also known as the Queen’s Necklace for its glittering arc of lights). Nariman’s activism led a part of the Back Bay to be named after him in independent India: Nariman Point.



With the reclamation of Marine Drive, “The idea was that the reclamation would provide space for public buildings and ease population density,” says Gyan Prakash, professor of history at Princeton University and author of Mumbai Fables. “Once reclamation was done, the attention turned to design and architecture” – in this case, art deco-style apartments along Marine Drive that embodied the cool, affluent cosmopolitanism of modern Bombay.

Not all of the city, though: large numbers of its people lived in significantly less swanky surroundings, and still do. Even today, 60% of Mumbai lives on pavements or in “slums” (defined by the census of India as “unfit for human habitation” for any number of reasons).

Take Dharavi, for instance. A century ago it was at the edge of Bombay, created by an existing Koli fishing settlement plus potters and tanners displaced by the city and, later, migrants from various parts of the country. Now, with the suburbs densely populated, Dharavi is at the heart of Mumbai. It is prime land for the city’s builders and a different style of reclamation is being attempted.

Several “slum rehabilitation” projects have been proposed (and largely thwarted) to let builders house existing residents in apartments built on part of this land, while making their sizeable profits from developing the remainder. A common criticism of these projects is that it puts the priorities of builders ahead of Dharavi’s current residents, who will have to live at densities unheard of even for Mumbai. A controversial reclamation of land not from the sea, but from a sea of people.

The city’s last major reclamation from the sea, at Nariman Point in the 1960s and 70s, was marked by accusations of collusion between the government and builders. “A lot of the reclaimed land was given out to private builders without public auction,” Prakash says. “Khurshed Nariman had railed against corruption in the 1920s – but now that muckraker’s name was used for the scam-ridden Nariman Point.”

Corporate towers came up on the reclaimed land. A sign went up outside one of the first edifices: “Nariman had a point and we are on it.”

“Barring the Nariman Point reclamation, there was no substantial change to the city since the 1940s, when the Queen’s Necklace was completed,” says Mustansir Dalvi, a professor at Mumbai’s Sir JJ College of Architecture. Yet in the last decade or two, he adds, “The fabric of the city is being torn apart.”

This he attributes in large measure to redevelopment, where the city ups the Floor Space Index (FSI) – the built-up area permitted on a piece of land– and “perfectly good buildings” are torn down and rebuilt. “It is the city being vampirical on the city itself.”

Only fleeting reminders exist in Mumbai today of its emergence from the sea – a preponderance of causeways; landlocked places with waterside names such as “creek” and “foot wash”. But once or twice a year in the monsoon, large parts of the city go under water, the trains stop, and so does Mumbai.

The deluge of 26 July 2005 was particularly bad, triggering floods that killed hundreds of people. There were several reasons: inadequate drainage rebuffed by a high tide, certainly, but also the city’s hunger for space – too much land built upon; the reclaiming in recent years, often illegally, of mangroves and floodplains that act as natural safeguards.

“Today, the one commodity in Mumbai costlier than gold is real estate,” says Dalvi. “There is a kind of unbridled desire to keep building” – which has dangerous implications for the future of the city.

“When you build on stream and river beds, you block off natural channels that divert water,” Dossal explains. “By cementing over areas, you don’t allow percolation. If high tide and heavy rains come together, you are really calling for a disaster.” It is almost as if the city doesn’t remember where it came from.

The north east monsoon rains under the influence of the low pressure in the Bay of Bengal last week came as a double shock to residents of Telangana’s capital. Having gone through harrowing days in the first week of September with heavy rain and flooding shutting schools for five days, the second shock was worse than expected. “We were just returning to normalcy but these four days of thundershowers have been real mean,” said Alex Smith, an American consultant of an IT giant. Smith had come to Hyderabad to conduct a seminar for Java professionals last week.

KCR said that the illegal buildings on drains and tank beds needed to be cleared immediately to improve the brand image of Hyderabad as a global city. “We will relocate all the poor living in such encroached land free of cost with double bedroom flats, but every illegal construction on nalas, tank beds etc will be demolished, come what may, and whoever it belongs to, whether politician, Minister or MLA,” said KCR, urging the media to back this campaign. “Citizens who provide information on violations will be suitably rewarded upto Rs 10,000,” he added.

Four platoons of the army and over 200 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel with boats and choppers have been deployed for rescue and relief operations. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and police are now identifying old buildings - there are an estimated 2,200 or so of them - and vacating them anticipating their collapse after days of waterlogging.

Hard times for Hyderabad

Flooding has occurred both due to overflowing drains and encroachment of nalas. The unprecedented downpour has turned the spotlight on the need to unclog drains all over the city. TRS leader and former employee of the GHMC V Srinivas Goud confessed in a TV debate last week, “What else can happen when 80 feet nalas were reduced to 8-10 feet with encroachments and rain water has nowhere to go but flood the streets?”

It was a Black Wednesday of sorts last week for the residents of Bhandari Layout, a colony of 50-odd multi-storeyed apartments with a population of 10,000 in Hyderabad’s northwestern Nizampet area. With the breach of the bund in the nearby Turka Chevuru, rain water entered the colony, which is allegedly built on a nala.

The GHMC and the police have already put in action a task force to assess the damage caused in Bhandari Layout, and to detail how many of these buildings are illegal in the first place. Panic-struck residents are refusing to leave their homes, afraid that they will be demolished after the rains. “Why blame the flat owners now, what did the authorities do when they approved the layout and gave all permissions?” asks Rahul Kumar, an IT professional who bought a flat in Bhandari Layout in 2010.

As rain pounded the colony nonstop from Tuesday night until Friday, residents had to spend three nights without power, milk or drinking water as their roads, basements and in some cases, even the first floors of their buildings were flooded. Authorities shut down power supply to prevent electrocution. Irrigation Department officials said leakage and breach in the Turka Cheruvu bund had led to the submerging of areas downstream of Nizampet. “I have never seen such downpour or even water logging,” said Paladugu Parasuram, a builder and publisher who has lived in the area since 2007.

As many as 41 roads covering 120 km in the city were out of use due to waterlogging in Ameerpet, Banjara Hills, Panjagutta, Malakpet, Chadarghat, Musheerabad and Mytrivanam. “Unless water is drained out with heavy duty diesel motors and repaired, they cannot be used. But with the impending rains we cannot do anything right now,” said Disaster Management Assistant Commissioner K Badrinath. Water stagnating at many junctions for two days has made relief and rehabilitation a tough task. However, KCR dismisses media reports about damage to roads, claiming that only 10 percent of the city’s roads (which span 9,000 km), have been affected.

IT Hubs Hit

For the first time in two decades, the IT corridors of Madhapur and Gachibowli were also hit. Sixty-seventy percent of employees of IT companies were caught in traffic jams on Raidurgam-Gachibowli, Miyapur-Kondapur and other roads leading towards Hitech City and Gachibowli. IT and ITeS companies permitted their personnel to work from home on Friday as incessant rains and pothole-ridden roads deterred them from reaching their offices.

“We don’t have power at home and basic supplies to stay indoors, so we decided to go to office and got caught up in traffic jams. What can we do at home, we don’t have cable network or power, and it is better to sit in office where authorities will provide us something,” said Arpita Kulkarni, an IT employee.

As rains are expected to continue for a few more days, IT companies are on tenterhooks and already have arrangements in place for Business Continuity Planning (BCP) which involves seeking help from other centres such as Visakhapatnam, Chennai, Pune and Bangalore to back them up if more rain hits. “The writing on the wall is that a contingency strategy is essential for all Hyderabad-based 24x7 ITeS and IT units,” said the Society for Cyberabad Security Council (SCSC) in a statement.

The affecting of 4.5 lakh IT workers also hit eateries, shopping malls, multiplexes and recreational areas in Cyberabad and Hitech city as no one could venture out. At least 2,100 weddings have been cancelled as marriage halls were flooded. The GHMC and police have offered to help conduct weddings by opening a registrar’s office on a 24x7 basis.

It Has All Happened Before

To understand this year’s mess one needs to go back to the year 2000. Back then in August, rainfall was just 13 times the average in monsoon but caused flash floods in the Musheerabad nala as authorities released rainwater in the wee hours of the morning without prior notice from Hussein Sagar to avoid breaching of the tank bund. This led to waterlogging and rendered over 5000 people from poor families in 20 colonies of Gandhinagar and Ashok Nagar in Musheerabad homeless. “The damage to life is less this year in view of GHMC’s preparedness for rains,” argued Musheerabad MLA and Home Minister Nayani Narasimha Reddy, who had criticised the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government at that time.

It could well have been a scene out of a horror film in 2000 - computers, household goods, cars and motorbikes floated in the flooded nala. People living in multi-storeyed apartments along the nala had to vacate their homes as rainwater entered even first-floor flats and stagnated for two days, and hundreds of families were left homeless. Then-Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu blamed the mess on officials who allowed buildings on drains, washing his hands of any responsibility.

Sixteen years later, the extent of damage to private and public property is much larger this time, though it is yet to be assessed. Chief Minister KCR said the La Nina effect was on this year leading to cooling of the earth, delaying the withdrawal of the North East Monsoon, which would last till 20th October. “So brace up and be prepared for more rains and stop this blame game,” he warned Opposition parties and the media.

“The rains of the last four days were unprecedented in the last three decades. No infrastructure could handle such downpour. We received 16 cm of rain in a single day on 21st September, as against 32-40 cm throughout the year,” stated GHMC’s Deputy Commissioner P Saroja.

“The worst is not over yet,” warned YK Reddy, chief of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) at Hyderabad, who has issued a red alert warning that heavy to very heavy rains are likely to continue. “It is the low depression in the Bay of Bengal that has driven the rains down south causing heavy downpour,” he said, adding that the La Nina effect had also kicked in.

Demoilition Drive

“It is common knowledge that Hyderabad has an aged drainage and sewerage system, with only 1,500 km of drain main canals and 2 lakh manholes, as against a requirement of 5,000 km of drain canals and 4 lakh manholes. Since the past six decades, nothing much has been done towards remodelling the drains,” said N Karthika Reddy, a retired GHMC engineer.

GHMC officials confess that successive governments failed to complete the remodelling and widening of storm water drains even 8 to 10 years after it was conceptualised, thanks to political instability and uncertainty in the state. Not even 50 percent of the required repairs of nalas have been done in the past five years due to “several obstacles in carrying out the works,” according to a source, who added that several contractors have just given up following threats from those with political influence opposing the demolishing of structures needed to carry out the repairs.

Though under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) a sum of Rs 260 crore had been sanctioned for widening of four primary and 11 secondary nalas, and the contracts were awarded seven years ago, the GHMC has completed only 40 percent of the widening work.

The TRS government is now gearing up for a massive campaign against encroachments on tank beds and illegal buildings on drains. Like Naidu before him, KCR has blamed the flooding on past governments, accusing them of neglecting nalas and water bodies.

“I assure you there will not be a single illegal building hereafter and I want the ministers, the GHMC and other agencies concerned to work in coordination and ensure that they do not permit any illegal building. If any one is permitted, it will be demolished mercilessly, however big its owner may be,” said the Chief Minister.

As early as 2015, KCR had launched a campaign against encroachments on irrigation tank beds, particularly in Hitech city. However, the exercise was dropped as it turned into a political campaign against Seemandhra industrialists and tycoons. Film actor Nagarjuna Akkineni had been caught in that web when his N-Convention centre in Hitech city, allegedly built on a tank bed, was issued show-cause notice, but a compromise was eventually reached.

KCR added that the Musi River, which at one point had an excellent drainage system, had been rendered ineffective due to the nearly 390 encroachments along its canals. The river was the artery of Hyderabad when the city was built four centuries ago, and its flooding in 1908 killed thousands, after which Visvesvaraya was sent by the British government to the Nizam of Hyderabad to remodel the system and build an effective bund. “We are still enjoying the labours of Sir Visvesvaraya,” said KCR.

At a review meeting on Friday, Municipal Administration Minister KT Rama Rao said a five-member expert committee has been set up to prepare an action plan by 5th October on how to go ahead with razing illegal constructions, and the infrastructure and legal opinion needed on how to clear them. This is the third committee on encroachments since 2008. The Kirloskar Committee report, and that of a cabinet sub-committee set up by KCR after the formation of Telangana, are gathering dust with the government even today.

Rao also indicated that he had the Chief Minister’s endorsement to launch an action programme similar to that done in Bengaluru in August this year, in coordination with the courts and the police department. “I have discussed the issue with the Advocate General S Ramachandra Rao who says legal hurdles, if any, will be resolved,” he said.

KCR has announced that an internal assessment of the GHMC and Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority has already been made to remodel the drain system in Hyderabad, covering the entire area at a cost of Rs 29,000 crore. “We will get loans and Government of India grants for the plan once it is ready,” he said. The government wants to launch this after the first phase of Metro Rail work is completed in the state capital by 2017, to avoid disruptions in road connectivity, he added. A sum of Rs 300-400 crore has been immediately made available to GHMC for repairs and other activities now, said the Chief Minister.

Following last week’s deluge, the GHMC is now claiming it has removed 775 encroachments out of 2,452 storm water drains in just one year. The GHMC mayor went on record stating that as many as 48 illegal constructions were demolished on Friday itself. This monsoon, 416 illegal buildings on nalas were demolished, and another 147 were demolished in September alone.

However, this is at best a drop in the ocean according to city-based environmentalist and campaigner for a better Hyderabad, Captain J Rama Rao. “We never doubt the good intentions of our politicians, but the only thing is whether they will do it and when,” he said. “Let us hope this government will not wait until another deluge and take last week’s situation as a wake-up call. Otherwise it will not take long for Hyderabad to lose its lustre and glitter.”

347,347,mumbai,2016,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-natural-calamities-disasters-chennai-uttarakhand-mumbai-floods/,24 Mar 2016,When nature strikes,"Chennai 2015, Srinagar 2014, Uttarakhand 2013, Mumbai 2005. These disastrous floods remind us that without proper planning, unusually heavy rains in densely populated areas can brew a deadly cocktail for disaster. The issue is not just India’s alone. In our rapidly urbanising world, making towns and cities safer is emerging as one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century — be it for a natural disaster, a health epidemic, or any other largescale calamity. Therefore, today, as India massively ramps up infrastructure and promotes smart cities, it’s time to build resilience into the blueprint for the future, strengthen cities’ ability to respond to a disaster, as well as to recover rapidly if it does occur.

From the time a super-cyclone hit Odisha in 1999, and a devastating earthquake shook Gujarat in 2001, India has sought to build a safer, disaster-resilient nation. Not surprisingly, Odisha and Gujarat were among the first states to set up institutions to deal specifically with disasters. Then, in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami, and following legislation in 2005, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was established in 2006.

At the global level too, efforts to boost urban resilience are gaining momentum. In 2014, nine institutions, including the World Bank and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) — the world’s largest fund for disaster prevention and recovery — announced the Resilient Cities Initiative, a worldwide collaboration to make cities safer.

Lessons from across the world show that much can be done to reduce risk, even in complex urban scenarios. To increase resilience, critical infrastructure and services — schools, hospitals, water, electricity, communications systems, transportation, etc — will need to be built or retrofitted to withstand multiple hazards so that they continue to function in an emergency. India’s coastal areas are making a beginning with a number of projects, including the Union government’s National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP), building the resilience of power infrastructure by placing electrical cables underground, among other measures.

Preventing urban flooding will be equally critical. Already, floods are the most frequent of all natural calamities and, with the likely growth in high rainfall events, storm surges, and sea-level rise, urban vulnerability will only increase. Seoul has tackled frequent flooding by combining hydraulic modelling of stormwater drains with the strategic placement of sophisticated pumping stations, allowing flood waters to be pumped out into the sea in times of heavy rain. Buenos Aires, too, has controlled this hazard after two crucial tunnels were constructed in its flood-prone central area. Similarly, it will be important to upgrade waste collection as carelessly handled garbage and construction debris are a major cause of clogged water outlets.

While modern technology can help forecast floods and cyclones, no precise methods exist to predict earthquakes. Enforcing building codes will therefore be imperative, especially in India where almost 60 per cent of the landmass is seismically vulnerable. The risk is particularly high in the Himalayan states where several strong earthquakes have resulted in sizeable loss of life and property. Nonetheless, urban development has proceeded apace and, despite the introduction of building codes in the 1960s, a large percentage of structures fails to meet standards and many are too high for an earthquake-prone region. Today, Istanbul has emerged as one of the most proactive cities in the world in safeguarding against seismic risks. The city has retrofitted more than 700 public buildings and trained more than 4,50,000 people in disaster preparedness. In an interesting innovation, Madagascar has made both builders and approvers liable for the safety of a building.

Other measures will also be important. All towns and cities will benefit by collecting and sharing data on population densities, critical infrastructure, buildings, etc, enabling them to direct urban growth to safer places. The NCRMP, being implemented by the NDMA, is doing just this by developing a digital platform that will help determine vulnerabilities to weather-related events along India’s coastline. This will help define land-use along the 7,500-km coast — three-fourths of which is cyclone-prone — and determine how strong we need to build to save lives.

Should a disaster strike, a swift response can keep casualties low. After the Gujarat earthquake flattened towns and villages, the state established emergency response centres across its territory, equipped them with specialised search and rescue equipment, and outfitted emergency vehicles so that they could navigate narrow city lanes expeditiously. Recently, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Uttarakhand have established their own disaster response forces.

Involving local communities is also critically important. In Odisha, for example, local volunteers have been trained as first responders and equipped to provide first-aid and conduct search and rescue operations, with special evacuation procedures to be followed for the disabled and elderly. In Gujarat, all schools, including rural ones, conduct exhaustive earthquake and fire drills that instil a deeprooted culture of safety and preparedness. Another oft-repeated measure, but nonetheless critical, will be to pare down the multiplicity of urban authorities and align them with disaster-conscious ways of thinking.

Today, with over $2.2 billion in support, the World Bank is helping India better prepare for natural disasters and recover stronger from those that occur. Over 60 per cent of this support is deployed in India’s coastal states to build resilience against cyclones and related hazards. Support is also ongoing to several states that have been hit by disasters — after the Kosi floods in Bihar in 2008, the 2013 floods in Uttarakhand, Cyclone Phailin in Odisha in 2013, Cyclone Hudhud in Andhra in 2014, and the Jhelum and Tawi floods in 2014.",solution,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",1 December 2015,16 December 2015,"Chennai, Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur, Cuddalore, Villupuram, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Pudukkottai, Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga, Madurai, Dindigul, Theni, Virudhunagar, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, and Kanyakumari districts","1,044 mm (41.1 in)","₹10,000 crore (US$1.4 billion)",500+,18.3 million people affected,"The floods were caused by the combined effect of a depression in the Bay of Bengal and a trough in the Arabian Sea.

Yet it was the presence --- apart from culture-vultures, some well-known activists (including from Bollywood) , a sprinkling of the literati, and regular air-kissing event-goers – of many eager-beaver youngsters which was telling.

Ghosh’s latest book is about climate change and its consequences: a “dry” subject, which many of us would believe people of a certain age group (or not!) would hardly be interested in. Clearly such stereotyping is puerile and flawed.

Speaking to some of the youngsters at the event, they seemed better informed about climate change, and also more concerned. As inheritors of a future that is being shaped by others, they must be.

I don’t know whether it was inadvertent or deliberate that the release of this book virtually coincided with the 11th anniversary of the 26/7 storm. Either way, it was a timely reminder of the havoc climate change can cause, and why disaster planning for such acts of nature is imperative.

The 26/7 cyclone finds stellar place in The Great Derangement as a case study. Ghosh lives in Goa but is a frequent visitor to Mumbai and understands its ethos, strengths and weaknesses well.

Moreover, what can explain better the calamitous effect of climate change than a seemingly hardy, relatively well-to-do modern megacity of approximately 20 million people brought to its knees?

For the record, Mumbai experienced 944mm of rain on July 26, 2005. Several parts of the city were submerged under water for some days after. The cyclone took a heavy toll of life (500 reportedly died) and the exact figure of loss to property, business and other assets is still unknown.

For Mumbaikars, those were perhaps the most harrowing few days of their existence. Apart from the dead, many lives were shattered, or drastically altered.

The real issue, however, isn’t as innocuous as just non-stop rain; rather, it lies in understanding weather patterns, the environment and coping with challenges they throw up, as we pursue rapid urbanisation as those who study such phenomena warn us.

So, we come to the moot question.

How has Mumbai fared post 26/7? Despite that debilitating experience, dismally by all accounts, I’m afraid. There was a flood of promises after the deluge to build up a multi-pronged disaster management plan, but 11 years later, most of this remains on paper.

In fact, instead of the situation improving, instances of flooding have increased with each passing year, often after even modest rain, which shows the cavalier ignorance and/or indifference of authorities empowered to manage Mumbai.

Much has been written in this column about the muck that clogs Mumbai’s drains, the deteriorating sewage system, and rampant real-estate development without adequate safeguards to ensure the city doesn’t choke to bear repetition.

I won’t labour the point further. Instead, I’ll take this brief extract from Ghosh’s book to highlight the perils that Mumbai faces in a repeat of a 26/7-like situation.

He writes: “A distance of about 4 kilometres separates south Mumbai’s two sea-facing shorelines. Situated on the east side are the city’s port facilities, the legendary Taj Mahal Hotel, and the plaza of the Gateway of India, which is increasingly prone to flooding. Beyond lies a much-used fishing port: any vessels that had not been moved to safe locations would be seized by the storm surge and swept towards the Gateway of India and the Taj Hotel.

“At this point waves would be pouring into south Mumbai from both its sea-facing shorelines; it is not inconceivable that the two fronts of the storm would meet and merge. In that case the hills and promontories of south Mumbai would once be islands, rising out of a wildly agitated expanse of water.’’

After covering 20 nautical miles — 37km — sea water suddenly began gushing into the trawler and one of the khalasis (labourers) on-board heard a loud thud from the propeller. He informed the captain. “We thought the propeller hit a foreign object, and we ignored the sound. However, water started gushing into the trawler with great force.My men tried to empty the vessel using buckets, but the flow of water was fast, and we suspected danger,” said Meher.

“My men noticed that the epoxy coating of my trawler — a waterproofing paint to prevent water from entering the wooden hull — was missing and it was the epoxy coating slabs that hit the propeller. My captain turned the trawler around and planned to return to the Satpati coast. The safety of my crew was our priority,” said Meher.

“Hardly 2km away from the Satpati coast on Tuesday night, the trawler got stuck between the rocks. The cracks widened and water began to gush in with greater force.I saw 10 diesel drums — each of 200 litre capacity — blocks of ice, dry rations, net and other fishing implements swept away by the Arabian Sea. We were just helpless,” he said.

“Around 9.30pm, we saw the Satpati trawler, Sai Roop, passing by and we shouted for help at the top of our lungs. The captain mercifully heard us and came to our rescue,” said Meher. “However, problems arose as there was a 30-foot gap between our boats,and the sea was choppy. Sai Roop’s captain did not want to risk his trawler hitting the rocks. He was ready to help us, but was also worried,” added Meher.

“I tied a thick rope around my waist and jumped into the water. I swam the distance between our boats and boarded Sai Roop. I tied the rope to the rescue boat so it could tow my boat to safety. I braved the choppy sea so my crew could be saved,” said Meher.

“After nearly an hour of fighting the sea, Sai Roop managed to tow the boat to Satpati,and we were saved from certain death,as the water had submerged my trawler and we were at the mercy of Lord Ekveera — the presiding deity of the Koli fishing community,” he said. “The boat needs repairs costing Rs2lakh.

The worst affected: Localities around the Mithi river, especially those living at Bandra-Kurla Complex and near the airport. Reason: The course of the river had been re-aligned twice at right angles to expand the runway.

Eleven years later, there is no guarantee that the river, which originates at Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) and meets the sea at Mahim, won’t flood its surrounding areas again in case of heavy rainfall.

But what can be guaranteed is that 11 years later, no corrections have been made to the faulty urban planning and dilution of stringent rules.

The areas still have encroachments running parallel to the river. The river, which was a natural drainage system during monsoon, has been reduced to a sewage carrier, with effluents from illegal settlements and industries flowing directly into the river.

Nearly Rs1,600 crore has been spent to desilt, widen and deepen the river. But the work is far from over.

A retaining wall constructed in 2009 along the stretch has converted the river into a canal.

“Rivers cannot and should not be tied. The authorities have built walls along the river’s length to contain the water and avoid flooding. However, during high tide, when the sea water gushes in, there is no space for water to disperse, leading to more flooding,” said Janak Dafatri, from Jalbiradri, which along with Vanashakti, NGO, has procured orders from the National Green Tribunal on the legality of walls built.

The group had highlighted that the wall had interfered with nature and was built into the mangroves along the river.

Seven years after a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) had been filed, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in May 2016 slapped a fine of Rs25 lakh on the Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA) as environmental compensation. The retaining wall, however, remains.

Even after the devastating floods, land-starved Mumbai has devoured mudflats, saltpans and mangroves to satiate its real estate frenzy.

Environment clearance, coastal regulatory zone are still circumvented by builders to get the plans approved. Plans are afoot in the ambitious development plan 2034 to allow private developers to construct

affordable housing on more than 13,000 hectares of No-Development Zone (NDZ) land and salt pans.

Adding to the misery is the multi-authority involvement in rejuvenating the Mithi.

Of the 17.8 km stretch, 6km is handled by the MMRDA, while the rest is the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) responsibility. But the division of work has not resulted in better coordination, just a war of words.

At least four studies have concentrated on flood prevention and urban planning methods in Mumbai with scores of observation and recommendations and warnings, but another 26/7 deluge still remains a very real possibility.

There has been a severe leakage of edible oil from the storage area of a private company near the Jawaharlal Nehru Port, triggering a green concern.The naib-tehsildar of Uran taluka, Ravi Patil, told, “Since Wednesday evening thousands of litres of edible oil stored by the Ganesh Benzoplast Limited (GBL) company near JNPT leaked out due to some technical glitch.Efforts are now on to retrieve the oil from the local drains in order to stop it from going into the sea.”Patil has also reported about the oil leakage to the Raigad district collectorate and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board.When contacted, GBL’s CEO, Ramakant Pilani, said: “I am getting details about it from our Uran office. We do have a liquid storage tank at JNPT where edible oil is kept.” GBL processes and deals with a range of products which include food preservatives, sodium benzoate, lubricant components and benzoic acid among others.The leaked oil is said to have spread about 1 to 2 km from the storage tank facility at JNPT. On thursday, several workers were seen removing the oil from nullahs and drains and putting them in drums to minimize the impact of the leak.Patil said following this incident they will now examine the other oil storage tanks in the JNPT area belonging to GBL and other private companies.“Several large ships and cargo vessels are regularly docking at the Jawaharlal Nehru port for fuel refills and also to transport crude oil to other countries.

Collapse in Municipal Governance Is to Blame,"Regular flooding and water-logging in our cities indicate that the municipal administration and administrative coordination has collapsed.

Delhi and Gurugram were water-logged again on August 31. A hour of rain brought both cities to a grinding halt. This was not the first time such a situation had occurred; in fact it happens on regular basis. It seems that there is zero accountability and citizens continue to suffer because of the lackadaisical approach of the concerned authorities.

Every time, the blame game starts with no authority taking responsibility. In Delhi for instance, the government, the municipal corporation and the public works department continue to shift the blame onto each other.

One wonders why they can’t sit together to chalk out an integrated and coordinated plan to address the problems of flooding and water logging.

This year, similar flooding has been seen in Bhopal, Mumbai, Bangalore, Nashik and Chennai.

While there can be no control on rains, efforts need to be made to lessen the impact of flooding. In an ideal situation, when it rains, the street drains must keep a city from flooding. But for that, street drains have to be clean, and cleared of leaves and debris. It is the responsibility of the concerned municipal authorities to ensure that.

In many parts of the world, cities have adopted integrated storm water/flooding management plans to lessen and alleviate the problems resulting from water-logging and flooding.

Flood management plans

Flooding in cities is usually approached through the crisis management method. What we need is an integrated storm water/flooding management plan in each city, instead of the traditional storm water management planning. The former is a comprehensive, eco-system-based approach to rainwater management. It would provide direction for future development plans and identify infrastructural needs. The goal of such a plan would be to balance land use planning, storm-water engineering, flood and erosion protection, and environmental protection.

Traditional storm water management planning involves engineer-driven efforts and includes drainage systems, pipe and convey, and the protection of property. It is more reactionary and functions on unilateral decisions, local government ownership, extreme storm focus and peak flow thinking.

However, an integrated approach would be comprehensive and would be driven by interdisciplinary teams to include ecosystems, to prevent problems and protect property and habitats. It would mimic natural processes and function via consensus based decisions in partnership with citizens.

Lessons from the UK, Australia

In the UK and Australia different methods have been adopted to deal with severe flooding.

Temporary or ‘demountable’ flood barriers have been erected to provide additional protection to flood-prone areas. Lightweight sectional metal barriers are relatively inexpensive and can be placed in various configurations and removed completely when waters recede. Frame barriers consist of rigid frames holding an impermeable membrane and use the weight of the floodwater itself to hold the barrier in place.

Natural flood management offers a sustainable approach to managing floods and is intended to complement traditional ‘hard engineering’ techniques, such as flood barriers and concrete walls. These schemes rely on a combination of small-scale interventions with the aim of reducing the speed in the flow of converging water before it reaches larger rivers. Natural flood defence features include small barriers in ditches and fields, or notches cut into embankments, all of which divert the water into open land. Letting pools form outside the main channel of the river means the water is temporarily removed from the main flow reducing the power of the floodwaters.

Trees can also help defend against floods. Planting more trees catches rainfall and helps to remove water from the soil. Large areas must be reforested to make a real difference. Felled trees can also be laid across streams in wooded areas and help push unusually high waters into surrounding woodlands, although such schemes need very careful planning and management.

Sustainable drainage is a concept often applied to towns and cities which are especially prone to flash flooding after sudden heavy rain. In urban areas, large areas of concrete and tarmac, as well as the roofs of buildings, are impermeable to water. Rain is channelled straight into drainage systems which can be quickly overwhelmed. Hence, builders could be asked to landscape developments, so that water from roofs and driveways seep into open ground rather than rushing into the water system. Sustainable drainage entails that impermeable surfaces should be replaced with permeable material, allowing rainwater to drain into the ground – a process known as infiltration. Large ‘detention basins’ can also be built to collect rainwater and hold it, managing the volume of water entering urban rivers, while ponds offer further water-holding capacity.

Role of municipal authorities

What we require is proactive action by municipal authorities to prevent the impact of flood.

Most important, is to keep the drainage system clean on regular basis. This allows water to be carried down fast. One of the major causes for flooding in our cities is that the drains are choked because of solid waste such as construction material, plastics and paper that are thrown in drains. Streets need to be kept clean. As rain-water rushes into the storm drains, it carries solid waste into the drains. Low lands should have storm drains so that water does not get accumulated there.

Rainwater harvesting needs to be encouraged. It would ensure rain water goes to the sub-soil, rather than straining the drainage system. The drains need to be de-silted before the onset of rains to prevent them from getting choked.

Afforestation should be encouraged. Planting trees helps in binding the loose soil and reduces the impact of flowing water.

Municipal bodies of our cities have to come out with consistent and coherent urban policy. Water-logging and flooding is as much a result of incoherent urban policy as it is of poor implementation. In the absence of a coherent urban policy, citizens would continue to suffer and be stranded in their vehicles for hours on a rainy day.

And before the onset of monsoon this year, a total of 2549 hand-pumps in all the 21 districts were raised above the highest flood level (HFL), making it biggest self-sufficient potable water management for the flood-hit areas in the world.

Read more: It’s the season of flooding, but monsoon is below normal

“Now, when floods sweep any village that has elevated hand pumps, the villagers can get potable water by reaching these hand pumps. But, they have to wade through the flood water or reach in boats. Most flood villages have a boat or two,” said Virendra Pandey, a flood activist in Bahraich.

In August and September, floods often attain severity in UP’s 21 flood prone districts. So now, when floods occur, villagers at least have access to drinking water.

Subsequently, the idea was also implemented by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Delhi.

What’s the idea?

Bhaggu, 69, of Sohras village in Kaiserganj district of Bahraich says: “Since the age of 5, I remember that Ghagra flooded my village every year and the government has been a mute spectator of our sufferings.” His main concern is the availability of drinking water during floods. “During floods, we have water everywhere, but not a drop of potable water. All wells, ponds, taps or hand pumps get submerged. When floods occur, government machinery or NGOs distribute food packets, tarpaulin, kerosene, match-boxes, but no one ever bothers to do something for drinking water.”

Dharmraj, 46, who holds the same view, says: “So the villagers drink muddy water, either as it is or by sieving it through a cloth.”

This often resulted in outbreak of several water-borne diseases during the floods or as the floods receded. So, Rigzin Samphel, the then DM of Bahraich, ahead of the 2010 monsoon, began talking to villagers. An unidentified farmer sitting with folded hands suggested, “What if we raise existing hand-pumps from their ground level above HFL.”

“The idea looked appealing, and we realised that it did not require formulation of any new project but would only need elevation of the existing hand-pumps with minor funds,” said Samphel, who is now one of the officers in CM’s team.

The Economist magazine, in 2008, rated Samphel as one of the hardest working bureaucrats in the world. Soon after, the union rural development ministry awarded him for implementation of the rural employment scheme MGNREGA.

The district administration formed a team from Jal Nigam’s flood division. The engineers designed a prototype for elevated hand-pumps with a broad base to withstand flood water pressure. And in 4 months, drawing funds from the respective panchayats, raised 300 existing hand pumps in many villages above the HFL.

WhatsApp group for monitoring

When the CM’s ‘Hand pumps’ team comprising officers from Jal Nigam, Panchayat Raj, Rural Development and Rural Engineering Services began to work on it, they created a WhatsApp group of officers in all the 21 districts for day-to-day monitoring of the progress.

Engineer Utkarsh Shukla, the technical consultant for Ballia, wrote on the ‘Hand pumps’ WhatsApp: “All the gram pradhans are so impressed with the project that they are doing elevation of existing hand pumps in non-flood zones as well.”

Mumbai, India – For 40 years, 50-year-old Vithal Tare has been earning his living through fishing. Every day, he takes his boat out into the Arabian Sea off the coast of Mumbai.

But now he and other members of the Koli community (‘fishermen’ in local Marathi language) face an uncertain future: The planned 34km Coastal Road Project (CRP) will diminish an already dwindling supply of fish.

READ MORE: India’s ‘new cities’ plan – Environment not included

Activists and environmentalists say the nearly $1.97bn project – which would involve reclaiming land, constructing underwater tunnels and building stilted roads over the Arabian Sea – will be an “environmental disaster”, damaging the mangroves that act as a buffer between the sea and the land and, in so doing, help preserve the coastal ecosystem.

The project was approved by various government departments last December but is still awaiting clearance from the federal environment ministry.

Lessons unlearned

Local fishermen say that several infrastructure and real estate projects over the past few decades have altered tides and currents, driving fish away, and that they fear that by cutting down the mangroves, the CRP will destroy fish breeding grounds.

Maharashtra state, of which Mumbai is the capital, is home to nearly 10 percent of India’s fishing population, and the CRP is expected to affect more than 35,000 fishermen across 23 urban villages there.

Standing outside his home, Tare explains that he used to employ eight people, but not any more.

“Our lives changed as soon as construction of BWSL began,” he says, referring to the six-kilometre-long Bandra-Worli Sea Link that connects Mumbai’s western and central suburbs to the south. Constructed at a cost of $248m and running over Mahim Bay, it was opened in 2009.

“The noise and the land reclamation drove the fish away, and we incurred losses,” Tare says of that project.

He believes BWSL has adversely affected the livelihood of those in his community, while only benefitting builders and those wealthy enough to own cars.

India’s big cities fail to scrap waste problem

Despite several attempts to contact Radheshyam Mopalwar, the managing director of Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), which is involved in the construction of the project, Al Jazeera was unable to get a comment.

Rajesh Mangela, the secretary of Maharashtra Machhimar Kruti Samiti, a statewide fishermen’s association, says that since the construction of the BWSL bridge, at least two varieties of prawns and fish have diminished.

This means that fishermen must go further out into the ocean for their catch, but with tides doubling in height in recent years due to reclamation of the sea, this poses an added danger, particularly for those with small boats.

“Illegal constructions through reclamation of land by powerful builders has played havoc,” says Rajesh. “We have gone to court, registered cases against errant builders and corrupt government officials to no avail.”

Now, he says, he fears that “no lessons have been learned from the effects of BWSL”.

Reducing traffic congestion

The authorities say that the CRP will reduce traffic congestion and pollution in one of the world’s most polluted cities.

According to the chief minister of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis, the road will decongest Mumbai and create 91 hectares of green spaces. T he government’s Joint Technical Committee Report says the planned eight-lane highway will also increase road space to accommodate more vehicles.

But those who oppose it point to state transportation experts who say that the BWSL was initially expected to accommodate 125,000 vehicles a day, but that it only carries 45,000 because the toll fee- 400 rupees ($6) – is prohibitively expensive and public transport vehicles – used by nearly 90 percent of residents are not permitted to use it. They suspect the same will be true of the CRP.

Hussain Indorewala, a faculty member at Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute for Architecture and Environmental Studies, told a public hearing held by Independent People’s Tribunal (IPT) – an unofficial body of retired judges – in October that: “The CRP won’t ease traffic woes. Cars will be dumped from one part of the city to another. It won’t stop pollution. It disincentivises public transport.”

Only 1.2 percent of Mumbai’s population of 12.4 million will use the coastal road, he argues.

A report by IPT comprising of urban planners, environmentalists, transport experts, along with serving and former senior officials of the municipal corporation, who are also part of the IPT, described the planned CRP as unviable and damaging.

Eroding land and an identity

Fishermen like Tare say it isn’t just their livelihoods that are at stake. “It is a question of our identity,” he explains, looking out towards the sea.

Members of the Koli community say an increasing number of young people are taking up other jobs rather than following their elders into the fishing trade.

Sixty-two-year-old environmental activist Vivek Sundara takes daily evening walks on the promenade that overlooks the Arabian Sea. He is alarmed by the prospect of the CRP.

“I don’t know how Mumbai will deal with global warming and rising sea levels,” he says. “The CRP will destroy the mangroves and cause traffic congestion and noise and air pollution in one of the last remaining public spaces.”

The city, India’s financial hub, witnessed its worst-ever flooding in 2005 when close to 1,500 people were killed. Unregulated construction in coastal areas was considered partly responsible. But little has changed since.

“Illegal reclamation of land for construction was responsible for the 2005 floods,” says Darryl D’Monte, the chairman of the Forum of Environmental Journalists of India.

“Earlier, rainwater from the streets could flow into the ocean, but now the haphazard construction has impeded the flow, causing flooding. Construction debris is also dumped in the drains, which remain choked,” he says.

According to a research paper by Owi Kale from St Xavier’s College, Mumbai has lost almost 40 percent of its mangroves as a result of land being reclaimed for construction and development projects.

“Mangroves are known to help prevent flooding,” D’Monte explains.

The Maharashtra state government made changes to the Coastal Regulation Zone rules in order to greenlight the CRP last year, but activists say the project is still in violation of those rules, which bars construction nearly 500 metres from the coast.

“Mumbai has been left with one-tenth of the beaches it had a few years ago because of reclamation. Dadar’s 50-metre coastline that existed a decade ago, has been reduced to three metres due to BWSL,” says V Subramanyan Iyer, a former geology professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai.

“Mumbai lies in the seismic zone III, and so CRP is not practical,” adds Iyer, who is also part of IPT, explaining that Mumbai falls within the “moderate damage” risk zone for earthquakes.

Demolished homes

In the village of Moragaon in the Juhu neighbourhood of Mumbai, home to 800 fishing families, there is an air of despondency. Narmada Mangela, a 75-year-old fisherwoman and activist, says she has paid the price for resisting construction projects.

She says her home was bulldozed along with the rest of her community in 2005, after she mobilised residents against land reclamation by a private builder.

“I was at the forefront of the agitation,” she explains from her small kitchen. “That’s why they demolished my house, along with 165 other homes. Fifty-eight of them still have not been rehabilitated.” And it isn’t only homes that are endangered. Rajesh from the fisherman’s association explains that a planned water sports park is likely to occupy an area near the beach that his community uses to repair their boats and dry their nets. Seventy-year-old fish vendor Pushpa Mangela says that the fishing community does not even benefit from any of the developments. Her son cannot get a job as a lifeguard at the water park, she explains.

“You need five years of water sports experience. Our boys know about tides, others don’t,” she says. “How can we get experience when they don’t give us jobs?”

Tare sits on his boat looking at the sea.

“Why doesn’t the government ask us what to do and what is good for us?” he asks. Why are they catering to a certain class of people while destroying us?”",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Other parts of India –– from Bihar to Uttar Pradesh to Assam to Arunachal Pradesh –– also experienced heavy rains and floods, which claimed the lives of humans as well as animals, including Assam’s famed rhinos.

So severe was the flood and traffic situation in the Gurugram-Manesar belt on NH8, where most automobile companies –– including Maruti Suzuki India, Hero MotoCorp and Honda Motorcycle –– have factories that authorities imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC near the Hero Honda Chowk, and issued an advisory to people to avoid Gurugram.

Minister of Road Transport, Highways & Shipping Nitin Gadkari asked NHAI Chairman Raghav Chandra to rush officers to Gurugram to take steps to restore traffic flow on NH8.

All schools in Gurugram were directed to remain closed due to risks from open manholes and potholes.

“Because of traffic jams, especially on NH8, factories in Gurugram, Manesar, Dharuhera and Bawal are affected,” Kuldeep Jhanghu, General Secretary, Maruti Udyog Kaamgar Union, said. Many employees reporting for duty in the factories were stuck for hours, he added.

However, a Maruti spokesperson told BusinessLine that the company’s factories in Gurugram and Manesar were running fine and there was no impact on production. “There was some stress in the morning, but it was sorted out by noon,” he added.

In Bengaluru, heavy rains –– up to 41.8 mm in 24 hours –– caused lakes to breach and left entire residential and commercial neighbourhoods flooded. The worst-affected areas were in the southern and eastern parts of the city; many parts of Hongasandra and HSR Layout too were flooded. Major arterial roads, including Old Madras Road, Hosur Road, Outer Ring Road, Bannerghatta Road and Ballari Road witnessed severe traffic snarls.

Veerasandra Junction and the NICE Road junction were inundated, throwing traffic on the IT corridor hopelessly out of gear. Small industrial units and garment industrial units in the Bommasandra Industrial Area were particularly affected.

The floods glaringly exposed the underbelly of India’s cities: the absence of planning and civic maintenance. “The floods show up what is wrong with Gurugram, which is an accidental city,” said Rajiv Bhakat, Partner, Studio Code, a Delhi-based architecture firm. “In the absence of government planning, private players developed land, colonies and buildings for years.” But the limitations of infrastructure were starkly manifest, he added.

“Haryana must plan and execute rapid and massive infrastructural upgrades for Gurugram, a high-revenue generator for the State,” Bhakat added.

According to Dikshu C Kukreja, Managing Director and Principal Architect at CP Kukreja Associates, “The solution is very simple: GIS mapping of underground utility lines; establishment of a single agency with responsibility for coordination between all agencies laying underground utility such as water supply, sewer, stormwater, piped gas, telephone, electric cables, and proper desilting of drains in a time-bound manner.” .

In Bengaluru, too, civic experts blamed the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) and the BBMP for the poor state of infrastructure on the city’s outskirts.

BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, who toured the affected areas on Friday, said, “Our priority is to move residents from low-lying areas to safe places, after which stormwater drains will be widened to clear water-logging.” The problem, he added, had been compounded by the fact that five lakes are interlinked.

However, former World Bank Transportation Planner Arun Mokashi said it would be impossible to predict the extent of water-logging triggered by a very heavy rainfall. “Urban and transportation planners cannot design their systems for unprecedented rainfall,” he said.

Mokashi, who has worked for a number of multilateral agencies, pointed out that in cities such as Mumbai, citizens have learned to live with days of heavy rains, when all civic systems get paralysed. In particular, the city’s experience of the 2005 floods has made everyone cautious.

Architect and urban housing expert Chandrashekhar Prabhu said that cities such as Gurugram and Mumbai are “nothing but villages” bursting at the seams.

“There is no urban planning in Gurugram. Rampant urbanisation, failure to clear stormwater drains and corruption of local civic officials have added to the cities’ woes,” he said.

Prabhu alleged that real estate developers are only interested in constructing buildings unmindful of the impact on the ecosystem.

Across the country, Development Control (DC) rules make it compulsory for real estate developers to design systems to help water percolate into the ground. But politicians have ensured that such systems are never incorporated in the DC rules, he said.

RDSO officials on board said the train achieved the highest speed of 130 km ph. Though it started three and half hours after Rajdhani express, Talgo reached before the premium train.

“Until the last hurdle, it was running ahead of time. It crossed Delhi-Surat distance in 11.40hours,” he said requesting anonymity.

The Rajdhani Express, the fastest on Mumbai-Delhi route so far, can run at the speed of 91km per hour and takes 16 hours to complete this journey. The Talgo is capable of doing the same route at 160 km per hour.

The Talgo train recently became the fastest train in the country after it crossed 84 km distance between Mathura and Palwal in 38 minutes on a trial run, achieving a speed of 180km per hour.

The fastest train in the country so far is the Gatiman Express that runs between Delhi to Agra, capable of a top speed of 160km per hour.

Heavy rain and flood between Vapi and Udwada sections had hit the trial run of the Talgo train.

The nine-coach train that departed from Delhi on Monday evening was scheduled to reach Mumbai before 10am. The train was supposed to cover the distance of 1397km between the two cities in 12.30 hours in a record speed of 130-150kmph.

More than a dozen trains arriving to and departing from the city and have been stalled at stations en route and over 25 trains have been rescheduled, while a few others have been cancelled, informed Western railway’s Mumbai division. It is however not known where the Talgo train had to stop.

According to sources, flood water from Damangang river washed away an about 10m-long track between Vapi and Udwada section as it flowed over it. The place is about 169-174 km away from Mumbai’s Churchgate station. The north-bound tracks are affected more than the south-bound one.

Mukul Jain, divisional railway manager of WR, tweeted around 4.30am in the morning that they had started movement of trains on south-bound tracks with restricted speed. “Up trains started with restricted speed between Vapi-Udwada. Movement of regulated trains will get streamlined in the morning hours,” tweeted Jain.

WR spokesperson could not be reached for an official comment.

“My bamboo and banana plants, which sustain my family of four, are all gone. I don’t have any land now. We can’t continue living like this,” he said.

A few hundred metres away, Gereli Das is also building her new residence with wood and bamboo. She, her husband and daughter are among dozens who lost their lands to erosion and were forced to shift this monsoon.

“We survive by planting rice and paddy. But this year we cannot cultivate paddy as all our land is gone,” said the 60-year-old, who has shifted her house twice in the past six years.

Floods and erosion are not new to Majuli. From 1246 sq km in 1971, it has shrunk to 650 sq km at present. The island and the cluster of islets near it, is still significant – 80 km long and 15 km wide.

The island itself shapes and reshapes with each floods, land mass eroded at one end is deposited elsewhere.

Of the 248 villages on the island, 166 have been earmarked as threatened. Since 2001, more than 3,000 families have lost their land to erosion and were forced to relocate. Embankments are still home to more than 2,000 families.

Majuli, the hub of neo-Vaishnavite culture and spirituality, spread by 15th century social-reformer Sankardev, also face problems of connectivity and infrastructure.

It can be reached only by ferries and boats during the day, the condition of roads is poor and the 100-bed sub-divisional hospital lacks specialists. There is no major educational institution or avenues for employment.

But the floods also make the island a farmers’ delight.

The nutrient-rich sediments deposited on the banks of Brahmaputra make Majuli a very fertile place, favourable for agriculture for the 170,000-odd residents.

Transformation plans

But the island’s fate could change soon. The BJP-led governments in New Delhi and Dispur have launched a spate of plans and projects to transform Majuli through flood and erosion control measures.

On Thursday, a week after the island was declared the largest river island by the Guinness Book of World Records, the Assam government upgraded Majuli’s status from a sub-division to the state’s 35th district.

New chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who represents the island constituency in the state assembly, held a cabinet meeting in Majuli and announced the government’s determination to protect and develop it.

The cabinet decided to set up a centre for water resources to tackle floods and erosion. Construction of concrete roads all over the island was another decision taken at the meeting.

A cultural university and a post-graduate college are part of the state government’s Rs 1200-crore package for Majuli.

Talks are also on with World Bank and Asian Development Bank to fund an ambitious project to dredge the Brahmaputra and its tributaries and remove silt deposit which in turn would control flood and erosion.

“Construction of embankments, geo bags and tubes at erosion-prone areas and planting of grass with long roots, would control loss of land,” said Narsing Pawar, the island’s sub-divisional officer.

The Union government has already announced the construction of two bridges connecting two separate banks of the island. Also, a 121-km long national highway will be constructed to connect Majuli with two major towns — Jorhat and Lakhimpur.

The plans, when implemented, are expected to make access to Majuli much easier and bring tourists from within India and abroad to witness the island’s pristine beauty and also experience its art, culture and spirituality.

Preserving unique identity

Residents of Majuli, comprising mostly scheduled tribes and scheduled castes, are excited at the attention their island is getting at present. But there is also fear that connectivity and development may lead to the island losing its unique identity.

The ‘satras’ — Vasihnavite monasteries — whose numbers have reduced from 65 to 32 due to erosion, still practice and preach the plays, dances and spiritual ways professed by Sankardev over 500 years ago.

There is apprehension that unbridled rush of people from other areas could affect these practices which have remained unchanged for centuries.

“Connectivity has both positive and negative aspects. Majuli’s natural beauty and culture could get affected and we might end up like any other place,” said Hem Chandra Goswami, religious and administrative head of Samaguri ‘satra’, one of the biggest monasteries in the island.

Some feel lifestyles of the Mishing and Sonowal-Kachari tribals, who are dependent on the island’s soil and water resources, could get affected once Majuli is “transformed”.

Sonowal and his team has the task of ensuring that the likes of Bhakatram and Gereli get permanent addresses and there is controlled development while keeping Majuli’s culture and spirituality unadulterated.

Till Tuesday, nearly 10 lakh people were affected by the floods across 804 villages in 19 districts.

The death toll in the current wave of floods stood at 34 across the state.

The affected districts are Lakhimpur, Jorhat, Golaghat, Bongaigaon, Dhemaji, Dhubri, Morigaon, Kokrajhar, Dibrugarh, Biswanath, Nagaon, South Kamrup and Goalpara.

Among them, Dhubri is the worst affected with nearly five lakh people still suffering, followed by Barpeta with almost one lakh and Goalpara with 86,000 people currently hit by the floods, the ASDMA said.

Authorities are running 118 relief camps and distribution centres, where 23,405 people are taking shelter across 11 districts.

Over 20,000 hectares of crop area are still under flood waters across the state, besides washing away number of roads, embankments, bridges and other infrastructure.

Currently, Brahmaputra is flowing above the danger mark at Nematighat in Jorhat and Dhubri town.

Meanwhile, state industry minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said at a press conference that the government has Rs 654 crore under SDRF, out of which Rs 47.53 crore has been released to the districts for flood relief and rehabilitation measures this year.

He said the government will soon start working on strengthening of the embankments.

363,363,mumbai,2016,https://www.hindustantimes.com/static/brahmaputra-assam-old-man-river/,19 Sept 2016,The Old Man River: Escaping Brahmaputra's Fury,"In the dry season, the landscape around the course of Brahmaputra holds a different look. The flood plains expose an intricate network of roads and paths leading to the human settlements, raised at level much higher than the paddy fields — which regularly get inundated — so that they remain accessible even when water rises to several feet.

Floods and displacement — temporary or permanent — are a way of life. People have developed methods to deal with the situation, including raised hand pumps and houses on stilts.

When we had visited in February and March — from Dhemaji to Dhubri — accessing some of the remote villages meant travelling on different modes of transport. It took us an hour of scooter ride to reach the nearest river bank. Then, after a long wait for a small boat, we hauled the scooter onto the boat to get to an island. These islands are locally known as char.

Boats are a lifeline for the people in chars. Small, motorised ferries are their only connection to the outside world. A boat on its way to Tapajuli Pathar in Barpeta. (Furquan Ameen Siddiqui / Hindustan Times)

The Tapajuli Pathar in Barpeta is formed by two tributaries of Brahmaputra. The flood-prone char, inhabited by over 1,800 Bengali-speaking Muslims, is one of the most backward areas of Assam.

According to the Jhai Foundation, a non-profit that works in char areas, one of the most backward villages in Assam is Barpeta’s Uttar Godhani, where literacy rate is just seven per cent. “In such places, the only option for health care are people such as Rahman, who runs a medicine shop,” says Abdul Kalam Azad of the foundation.

In a place where people lack even basic shelter or avenues for livelihood, health care and education take a back seat.

“We lose our crops to river, predominantly rice and jute, when the floods are early,” says 60-year-old Noor Mohammad. “In my lifetime, I’ve seen the river take away my house at least 10 times, and every time we have constructed a new one.” The level of water, according to Mohammad, sometimes goes up to six or seven feet. “We either move to the platform or wait it out on the roof. If the animals don’t fit, rafts made of banana plants keep them from drowning,” he says.

Forced by abject poverty and lack of public facilities, every family has sent at least one of its members to faraway cities such as Bengaluru, Delhi and Chennai. “Almost all the young men in this village work as urban labour, working primarily as construction labour in the cities,” says 18-year-old Mohammad Ali Hossain. “I earn around Rs.8,000 to 9,000 per month in the city and save around half of it. We work on the farms when at home, but spend around six to eight months outside the state.” Hossain and his three brothers work in the city and fund the youngest one’s education in the hope that he’ll pull the family out of poverty.

Far away, in the upper part of the river in Dhemaji’s Simen Chapori, Kamal Basumatary has a similar tale. Basumatary lives with his family in a bamboo hut alongside a road that used to go to his village. Now it leads to the river.

About 120 families from four villages were displaced last year during the floods and have been living on the roadside since. “It [Brahmaputra] was around 1.5 kms from its current position now,” says 60-year-old Basumatary, an ethnic Bodo. “In just a year, it took the whole chunk away. We farmed on the little bit of land we had. Now we work as manual labourers in the city.”

Last year, around 120 families were displaced permanently after the river eroded four villages in Dhemaji’s Simen Chapori. The families set up temporary, tin-roofed hutments on the land leased from the village community. (Furquan Ameen Siddiqui / Hindustan Times)

People in this part migrate to other states too, to Rajasthan, Gujarat and Delhi to look for work. The women leave to work as house helps. Basumatary’s daughter was sent to a government official’s house in Arunachal Pradesh to work as a help. Basumatary’s neighbour told us how agents from Delhi came offering her two daughters similar work.

The cycle of devastation continues in dry season, too. Large chunks of land crumble from the edges into the river. Erosion is another problem that people in Assam have to deal with.

In 2010, then-revenue minister Bhumidhar Barman claimed in the state assembly that erosion had become more dangerous than floods. Five years later, in the assembly, he said that 36,981 houses were eroded in the past five years. In the 15 districts that he mentioned, 880 villages were eroded completely while 67 were eroded partially. The districts of Dhubri, Jorhat and Barpeta, according to him, were affected the worst. Most of the char villages are located in these districts.

The total area eroded since 1950 is approximately 4,270 square kilometres, about seven percent of the land in the state’s 17 riverine districts. Majuli, one of the largest river islands, has shrunk from 1,256 square kilometres in 1891 to about 421 square kilometres today.

Faiz Ali lives in Bashani char, an island accessible by land during the dry season. In February, we rode on a motorcycle on white sand on the riverbed from Dhubri to reach to 45-year-old Ali’s house, where he worked on his paddy field. Ali, a Bengali-speaking Muslim, claimed that he lost about 10 bighas of land last year alone.

Villagers walk to their village near the Bangladesh border from Dhubri town. People who can’t afford to take a jeep to their villages walk for 10-15 kms on the river bed to reach home. (Furquan Ameen Siddiqui / Hindustan Times)

In Kamrup district’s Kathalguri char, 40-year-old Aamir Ali was gathering his belongings from a bamboo hut that was falling apart. Surrounded by the river, the char is accessible only by boat. “My house was right there,” Aamir says pointing towards the crumbling edge. “The river took it away around two months ago.”

Why do people stay in these places despite the constant fear of displacement? “Kot jabo? (Where will we go?),” says a Tapajuli villager. “It is so expensive outside to purchase a land. A small piece of land costs upward of Rs.3-5 lakhs. Where will we find that kind of money? A lot of people have left already, whoever managed to earn some money. Only the poor remain here.”",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Three persons drowned at Bhagrawada village in coastal Valsad, while two others drowned in Orsang river near Bodeli in Chhota Udepur district, officials said.

Three bodies have been retrieved while operations are on to find the other two, they said.

In south Gujarat, Valsad received 245 mm rainfall in 24 hours till this morning, Navsari 96 mm, Dangs 104 mm of rainfall. Chhota Udepur in east-central Gujarat received 28 mm rainfall. The state has received 299.27 mm rainfall, or 37.55 per cent of average rainfall.

Several low-lying localities in Valsad city including Andhiawad and Kasturba hospital area were also affected, with reports of persons stranded on roof top being relocated to safe areas, they said.

Pardi town in Valsad district was also affected with several persons in Kosamba in coastal Valsad having been rescued by Indian Coastguard helicopter.

“A helicopter of the Indian Coast Guard from Daman along with teams of National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) from Surat were pressed into action along with local police to carry out rescue operations in affected villages, mainly those situated along the coastal areas,” Valsad Collector Remya Mohan said.

Water level at Auranga river was recorded at 11.5 metres, which is about one metre above the danger mark, disaster management officials said.

Damanganga river in Vapi in Valsad district was also flowing near danger level due to water released from Madhuban dam in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, they said.

In Navsari, Ambika river was flowing near the danger level, with nearly a dozen villages affected due to flooding, officials said. Gandevi in Navsari was particularly affected with several villages cut off due to flooding of connecting bridge over Ambika river.

The global reinsurer said that the total insured losses in India were USD 1 billion in 2015, up from USD 971 million the year before. The severe flash floods in Chennai in November were the largest disaster, causing estimated economic losses of USD 2.2 billion. Insured losses were estimated at around USD 755 million, making these floods the second costliest insurance event in India and a large part of the losses originated from commercial lines. The event highlighted the vulnerability of rapidly growing urban areas to flash floods caused by heavy rains, said the company in its report.

Vulnerability to earthquake hazards

In India, uninsured losses from all catastrophes and man-made disasters were 84 per cent of the total losses in 2015, down from 93 per cent in 2014. Although the protection gap was smaller last year than in 2014, it was still high relative to global and regional standards. The global protection gap was around 60 per cent in 2015, down from 68 per cent in 2014. In Asia, the gap was at 81 per cent in 2015, down from 90 per cent in 2014.

Many cities in northern India are located close to the seismic gap in the Himalayan range. A seismic gap is an area where plate movement has already produced land deformation but – as of yet – not released the associated energy in the form of an earthquake. The likelihood of earthquakes in seismic gaps is very high, and the expected magnitude of such an earthquake in the Himalayas is Mw 8.0–8.5. Many Indian cities, including the national capital, Delhi, are close to the gap and are vulnerable to earthquakes. According to the 2011 census data, around 90 per cent of Delhi’s building stock falls in the category of unreinforced masonry, which is not earthquake-resistant.

367,367,mumbai,2016,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/a8herzL1neqG1YQ35Yj6RI/Floodplains-and-flash-floods.html,11 Aug 2016,Floodplains and flash floods,"My first exposure to “the field"" as a budding administrator was during a “village attachment"" in central Uttar Pradesh in northern India. The year was 1983. I still remember the name of the village, Chaturabehar, in Sitapur district. Every villager we met, owner cultivator to landless labourer, had the same woeful tale of collapsed houses and submerged crops to narrate.

Floods have long been a regular feature of life on the Indo-Gangetic plains. The administrative records of British India, however, indicate that the chief threat in these parts before the advent of canal irrigation was not floods but monsoon failure. Successive failures caused famine, disease and epidemics. Excessive rainfall caused short-term havoc with positive spin-offs.

My own research on the eastern reaches of the same vast floodplain on which Chaturabehar was located is illustrative. The rains in south Bihar were excessive in 1867, about 50% above the long-term average. Both the Ganga and Sone rivers were in spate, destroying the standing bhadoi crop. H.W. Alexander, collector of (erstwhile) Gaya district, noted that “the lands near the river sown with this crop are always liable to be flooded and are moreover sown with the full knowledge of this risk; should they escape a flood in any year, a full harvest is reaped; should they be destroyed, the land is rendered by the flooding more rich and fertile for the ensuing rubee (winter) crop. No crops could look finer than do the rubee crops now on the very lands which a few months ago were under water... thus the gains on the rubee almost compensate for the loss to the bhadoi."" The 60-day bhadoi was a bonus crop, grown in just 10% of the area, and when it was lost a better rice harvest ensued.

Two years later the Sone flooded again on 18 July, 1869, but receded within a few days, doing little damage to the bhadoi on the ground and improving “the land considerably by leaving behind it a mouldy deposit"".

Medieval Europe followed an extensive protocol of cyclical fallowing, the “three-field system"", under which only one-third of the cultivable area was actually available each year. The densely populated floodplains of northern India, on the other hand, were cultivated without fallowing and fertilizers year after year. Cow dung was mostly used as household fuel. Would this have been possible without these periodic mouldy river-borne deposits? The Indo-Gangetic plains are one of the most naturally fertile regions in the world, home to some of the oldest and densest human habitations.

The floods in Chaturabehar were however not caused by discharge from rivers swollen with bountiful monsoon precipitation. They were man-made. The flood waters could not recede because of water logging and seepage from the Sharda Canal which, along with the new all-weather road and rail embankments, now blocked the natural lines of drainage.

Commenting on the flood prone nature of the river Sone over a century earlier, J. McNamara, district engineer of the erstwhile Shahabad district (adjoining Gaya), felt that the construction of the East India Railway mainline had increased the frequency and intensity of floods. The track embankments tampered with the natural drainage of the country. The construction of the Shahabad canal created new obstructions. A new kind of fever which district officials called the “Shahabad Fever"", soon became endemic in the area.

Something similar had happened in village Chaturabehar. British India civil servants had pointed to potential drainage problems while opposing the Sharda Canal scheme. Work on the canal began only after being shelved for half a century. Sub-soil saturation along the canal was more acute than in the western reaches of the Indo-Gangetic plain, where modern canals were first built in India. Chaturabehar was in the Awadh region, so plentifully supplied with water that the British called it the “Garden of India"".

What had once been a purely temporary flooding phenomenon of several hours, with beneficial spin-offs, now became a pervasive problem of water logging, breeding despair and disease. This also discouraged the kind of risk-taking and entrepreneurship in evidence in the Green Revolution western reaches of the Indo-Gangetic plain.

It is no coincidence that the oldest and most dense civilizations were all located on alluvial flood plains in Mesopotamia (Tigris-Euphrates), Egypt (Nile), China (Yellow River) and India (Indus-Ganga-Brahmaputra). Alluvium is a natural freshwater sink. Floods are the flip side of nature’s abundant bounty. Good drainage was always an issue. Before the emergence of big cities and modern development works, the flood waters were unimpeded, followed natural lines of drainage and receded seamlessly back into the river while recharging sub-surface aquifers and restoring soil fertility.

The drainage challenge in dense urban centres on the floodplains is more acute. Indian cities consequently need better drainage than their European counterparts. They need to evacuate large quantities of silt-laden flood waters, in addition to human sewage. The earliest urban centres in India, in the Indus Valley about five millennia ago, were global pioneers in constructing drainage and sewage systems. Mega European cities like Paris and London from early on built huge underground tunnels to evacuate large quantities of sewage generated by urban sprawls. Their Indian counterparts like Delhi and Kolkata do not have comparable underground sewage or drainage systems on this scale. Worse, extant water bodies and lines of drainage have been built over with concrete and asphalt. Delhi and Gurgaon now need just three hours of heavy rainfall to be flooded. The same narrative is repeated in Mumbai, Chennai and several other Indian cities.

Read | As rains spell trouble, Delhi gets caught in road agencies’ blame game

Unfortunately, the network suffers from complete neglect. In many places it has become a smelly sewer, in others it has been overrun by squatters. Since no one cares for them, they are easily hijacked for other purposes like car parks and roads. Municipal authorities claim that drains continue to flow under the new construction but they are difficult to clean and get quickly clogged with garbage. It is not surprising, therefore, that even a moderate shower floods the roads.

A similar story can be told of other Indian cities: The traditional water tanks of Bengaluru, Mithi river in Mumbai, the Adyar catchment in Chennai. The Noyyal is marked as a perennial river in 19th century maps of Coimbatore but is now a sewer. Varanasi derives its name from two streams — Varuna and Asi. The former is still a discernible river but Asi is now a municipal drain. Many locals who live along its banks were surprised when I pointed out its course.

The maintenance of the drainage networks is critical for avoiding repeated floods but they are also a solution to another major problem faced by Indian cities – the lack of walking and cycling paths. A critical flaw in public transport systems across India is first/last mile connectivity. In all other countries, this is usually walked but in India one is forced to haggle with a rickshaw even for a short distance.

A nullah network, by its nature, is made of long stretches of land. In fact, for historical reasons, the nullahs usually run close to the oldest and densest neighborhoods and are often the only open space cutting through the landscape. Rather than covering them up, walking paths should be build along the open nullahs. This would have the additional benefit of increasing public pressure to keeping the nullahs clean as people would be walking along them. Rastogi estimates that Delhi can have a first class walking/cycling network and a workable drainage network for a fraction of the money being currently spent on large, centralised sewage treatment plants.

The dual use of water networks as walking paths is not uncommon across the world. Many Western cities use paths along water-bodies as walkways and several Asian cities have adopted this model in recent years.

Till the 1970s, Singapore river was a foul smelling stream that took in industrial discharge as well as waste from hawkers and squatters. In 1977, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew put a target that it would be possible to eat fish from the river in 10 years time. Over the next few years, thousands of hawkers and squatters were relocated while industrial discharge was diverted to sewage treatment plants. By 1984, the river was clean enough for the government to organise a “mass-swim” that included senior government officials. Today, the old riverside warehouses of Boat Quay and Clarke Quay are among the most visited tourist sites in Asia.

Cheonggyecheon stream in Seoul is another example of watershed restoration as urban renewal strategy. In the 1950s, the stream had become a smelly drain carrying industrial and household sewage. An elevated highway was build over it in 1968. However, in 2003, the local mayor decided to pull down the highway and restore 7 km of the stream. The stretch is now the centerpiece of the city and 80,000 people use it everyday.

In an automobile obsessed age, we think of roads as the arteries of the city, but it is really drainage networks that should play this part. They are not merely to ensure that roads do not get flooded after a downpour but are an organic part of the city as green lungs, water-table recharge, public transport, waste management, and spaces for leisure. Other Asian cities have come to recognise this in recent years and it is time we did too.

“Everything is spoilt now. We were not expecting this much rain. I don’t know what to do now,” said Yadav, who has witnessed the worst agriculture crisis in the region over the last two years because of drought and unseasonal rains.

Yadav is one of the several farmers in the region facing the dilemma, leading to below average sowing of kharif crop seeds (less than 30%) this time.

According to Sagar Divisional Agriculture Office, till now sowing of kharif crops like soybean, til, groundnut, arhar, urad, moong, jowar, makka, and rice has been done only in 3,58,670 hectares of agricultural land against the intended 13,97,270 hectares.

Soybean sowing can be done till July 18

Agriculture scientist KS Yadav suggested that if the rain stops, soybean sowing could be done till July 18, after which it would not be advisable. However, certain varieties of pulses could be sown till month end, he said.

The Bundelkhand region, shared between Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, has been reeling in drought for the past two years whereas heavy rains this year have not only caused rivers and tributaries to overflow but have also damaged two dams built recently in Panna.

Dams built under Bundelkhand drought relief package swept away

The two dams, built under Bundelkhand drought relief package in Bilkhura and Sirswaha, were swept away on Thursday. Officials have blamed the use of sub-standard construction material for the damage. The Sirswaha dam was in its last stage of completion. In 2012, the Bitri Murmutu dam was also swept away due to use of sub-standard material in construction.

Panna Collector Shiv Naryan Singh Chouhan told HT that he had inspected the spot and the administration had evacuated people from three nearby villages. An inquiry has been ordered into the damage. Life has come to a standstill in the rest of Bundelkhand because of incessant rains for the last four days.

If you are really lucky, like textile manufacturer T Mathavraja from Salem turned out to be, you could drive home in a 2014 model Audi A6 that doesn’t even need any tinkering. Revealing that he paid just Rs 17 lakh for the car, an audibly excited Mathavraja gushed over the phone: “No, I did not even have to spend a paisa on repairs, not even for cleaning the vehicle! I just got in and began driving.”

The auction was conducted by cardekho.com at its yard in Tiruverkadu, Chennai.

“It felt fantastic to win this baby, when there were some 20-25 bidders at the auction! I would otherwise have had to pay Rs 50 lakh for it,” he said, adding that he mostly relied on his gut feeling to make the purchase.

However, Arvind Dabas – a car dealer operating from Delhi and Noida – brought with him a team of 15 highly trained mechanics armed with modern gadgets that leave nothing to chance. Speaking to HT, he said this could only be a win-win situation for him.

“There is no chance of making a loss. If there is vehicle that’s completely damaged, I rip it apart for parts. We will get its registration cancelled and buy it as scrap,” he said.

His team, comprising three engineers and a dozen mechanics, has been housed at a rented place in the outskirts of the city.

Dabas, who wants to buy many flood-damaged cars – irrespective of size or condition – from Chennai, intends to spend four to five months in the city. He has taken a huge 10-acre yard, capable of holding a couple of thousand cars, on rent.

The former constable is an old hand at purchasing cars damaged in natural disasters. Though he had bought around 300 cars in the aftermath of the Jammu and Kashmir floods, it couldn’t compare to Chennai – which he claimed was the “biggest” in terms of damages and number of cars on offer.

The city found another bulk buyer in Tayyab Mirza from Hyderabad, who picked up around 40 cars of various makes and brands.

If there’s somebody else who’s smiling amid all this, it’s the auctioneer himself – cardekho CEO Abhishek Gautam. This is his fourth flood-related auction, the previous ones being the 2005 Mumbai floods, the 2006 Surat deluge and – finally – the Jammu and Kashmir floods of 2014. He says that Chennai, by far, suffered the most in terms of vehicular damage.

“Auctioning some 5,000 vehicles is going to take quite some time, which is why I have taken a flat on rent for myself as well as my team from Delhi,” he said. Most of the submerged vehicles suffered from damage to their engines as well as electronic circuitry, Gautam added.

Dabas, quite an expert at vehicles himself, gives his opinion with greater authority. He says that while some cars suffered little damage and were in need of only a little tinkering, others – like a Land Rover he bought – would need anywhere between Rs 3-4 lakh to be made roadworthy.

“This is the estimate given by my engineers, and they are usually right,” he said in a telephonic conversation. His more notable purchases included a shiny Audi – barely a few months old – with a price tag of just `18 lakh.

These auctions also work to the advantage of insurers, who are otherwise stuck with the tough job of paying the clients their dues. “The more successful the auction, the better we can plug our losses,” said an insurance company official.

Insurance firms were flooded with as many as 30,000 claims for damaged vehicles during the November-December deluge. As many as 10,000 of these vehicles would have to be auctioned off, sources said, adding that high-end luxury cars would take at least three to six months to dispose of.

While owners can directly sell a damaged car, not many prefer to do it on account of the paperwork required as well as security issues. Alternatively, insurance companies deal with used car dealers who either repair it or sell it as scrap. The third option is to give the vehicles to auctioneers such as cardekho.com, auctions division and copart.in, which will try to get the best price for you.

Besides physical auctions, players like cardekho.com and copart.in carry out online auctions – thereby allowing people across the world to participate in the bidding process. And in a situation that works to the benefit of everybody from the insured to the auctioneers and the lucky buyers, the only losers turn out to be insurance companies.

“We are trying to cut down our losses… but all the claims are being settled in a fair and just manner to ensure that our clients don’t suffer,” the regional head of an insurance company said on the condition of anonymity.

The losses suffered by insurance companies due to the 2015 floods are huge, and it would be impossible to gauge the quantum of the claims at this juncture, he added.

Every ground floor house in his colony in Panvel was destroyed and till date they continue to remain vacant. But he says the devastation finally persuaded his Assamese colleagues and neighbours to move out of Navi Mumbai and populate Mumbai’s northern and western suburbs.

Until then, recalls the 64-year-old retired geologist, “Before the floods, no one wanted to move out of Navi Mumbai.” So while Kharghar continues to remain the hub of the Assamese community, significant numbers are now spread across Mira Road, Andheri and Kalina.

While the Assamese community traces its presence in Mumbai to the 1920s, the first large waves of migration took place in the 1970s when the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) set up shop here. “After oil was discovered in Mumbai, ONGC needed experienced officers to work here. So they transferred a lot of engineers and officers from Assam, where ONGC has been present for many decades,” added Mudiar, who retired from the ONGC in 2012.

Mudiar is also the president of the Assam Association of Mumbai, which is based in Vashi. Apart from ethnic cultural programmes, the association organises celebrations of the harvest festival Bihu in January and April. “Those who can’t make it to Vashi celebrate Bihu in small groups in their own localities,” says Dipak Das, the association’s vice-president.

The association also helps with the accommodation and counseling of patients from the north-eastern states who come to Mumbai for cancer treatment. “We arrange for patients to travel to the hospitals and book appointments for them. There is also an Assam Bhavan in Vashi, which provides accommodation exclusively to cancer patients,” Das adds.

Over 5,000 families from Assam are currently estimated to have made Mumbai their home. “When we first moved here, we had to celebrate Makar Sankranti on January 26 because that was the only day when members of our community who work in the defence sector get holidays,” says Deepa Jahan, who is in her sixties.

A retired professor of chemical engineering at Bhagubhai Mafatlal Polytechnic in Vile Parle, she says Mumbai is a “non-interfering” city and has eased her adaptation. “We adapt to all cultures very easily,” she says.

She rues however that in Mumbai, she gets to see fellow Assamese women dressed in traditional silk mekhala chador and men in dhotis only during weddings and on Bihu.

“The generation brought up here is a little detached but we are trying to ensure that they remain rooted to our culture,” she explains.

The first batch of now-retired engineers, officers and lower-level employees have now given way to larger migration of youngsters, who have come to dominate the city’s music industry.

Jutika Mahanta, a journalist and another vice-president of the association, says Mumbai is the obvious destination for gifted musicians. “The music industry in Mumbai is dominated by people from Assam. Mumbai is a dream city and that is why they want to come here,” she says.

Music composer and producer Ambar Das concurs. “You will find a lot of people who are musicians. For us, Mumbai is the pace to be,” said Guwahati native Das, who settled in Mumbai five years ago. He adds, “Walk into any recording studio in Mumbai and you will at least one sound engineer from Assam.”

National award winning music composer Anuraag Saikia admits to suddenly discovering familiar voices while in the studio. “There are times when I am frustrated and utter some slang in Assamese. The sound engineers then look around and say, ‘You are from Assam? Wow! Come to our place for dinner.’”

At 26, he has spent the past four years living in Mumbai. Saikia, who won the award for the best music director in 2014 at the 61st National Film Awards for the Assamese language film Yugadrashta, says that he does not find much difference in the folk music of Assam and Maharashtra. “Seventy per cent of people from Assam in Mumbai are here for the music. It’s a little crazy. Wherever we go, me mix so beautifully,” he says.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Floods ravaged parts of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry between November and December last year. The city of Chennai was the hardest hit.

Reports suggest that in Tamil Nadu alone, over 300 people lost their lives, nearly two million people were displaced, and preliminary flood damages were estimated at Rs 8,400 crores.

The floods were even discussed at the climate change negotiations in Paris in December, leading to another plaintive request for “concrete and urgent action against climate disruption”. This week, as another round of climate talks kicks off in Morocco, it is worth noting that such extreme weather events are expected to rise in frequency. Cities, which have a higher share of population and infrastructure, are particularly at risk.

But is there something to be learnt from every disaster? Does each episode offer crucial lessons that can become part of the area’s institutional memory for disaster preparedness?

Private sector interventions

In the case of Chennai, stories of tragedy and hardship were shared in real time, as were the rescue efforts of the government, the Chennai Corporation, police, and the armed forces. But in the age of social media, another unique account emerged: that of the interventions of a number of community-based organisations and the private sector.

Cities depend on a host of private services such as restaurants, retail stores, freight and delivery operations, schools, hospitals, hotels, taxis, and other businesses. Their understanding of the city, its geography, and the people they come in contact with, is unparalleled, and they form a critical part of the fabric of an urban community.

Early this year, two urban development specialists, who work in Delhi but were born and brought up in Chennai, decided to gather lessons from the Chennai floods. The organisation they lead, TARU Leading Edge, has worked extensively on cities and disaster resilience and is currently gathering evidence on resilience interventions in India and South East Asia as part of the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network.

""Building resilience requires learning from both experience and science for addressing new and emerging urban challenges,""said Umamaheshwaran Rajasekar, the TARU director. ""My colleagues and I wanted to capture some of the initiatives undertaken by various groups to manage the disaster to help others learn and incorporate such practices within their preparedness, prevention and response plans.”

The stories they collected, along with the attendant lessons, capture how a number of organisations were able to play to their strengths, and also employ innovative means to help the city in myriad ways during the disaster.

For instance, the Global Positioning System-equipped taxi service Ola Cabs formed a rescue team to transport food, water, and medical supplies to parts of flood-hit Chennai. What started out as a joke on Twitter – about Ola needing to provide boats instead of cars – was taken seriously by the taxi aggregator. Ola contacted local firemen and the Chennai Sport Fishing Company to gather details of local rowers and fishermen in order to provide free boat services in waterlogged and partially-submerged areas using information provided by the fire and rescue department. What is more, Ola replicated this effort during the floods in Allahabad and Varanasi in August.

In another part of Chennai, Kolapasi – a local catering service in Adyar, a neighbourhood in South Chennai – started serving free food to stranded people. It distributed approximately 6,000 food packets to people affected by the floods. Hotel Checkers in Anna Salai was one of the hotels that converted its banquet halls into dormitories for staff unable to go home because of the flooding. Many car dealers sent warning text messages to their customers warning them against driving through flooded roads. Car owners were also advised not to start cars in waterlogged areas to prevent hydrolock – a condition in an internal combustion engine that can lead to mechanical failure and engine seizure.

Having learnt from their experiences during the Kashmir floods of 2014 and Mumbai floods of 2005, automotive companies such as Toyota, Renault, Maruti, Hyundai and Nissan were better prepared to act through their dealers and service stations in Tamil Nadu.

Giving a hand

Similarly, after the Union government announced that the state-owned BSNL would not charge its customers for a week during the flooding last year, other telecom companies followed suit, providing their customers with free talk time.

Servals Automation, a Chennai-based social enterprise that provides rural energy products, started a programme called Marumalarchi to distribute cooking fuel and stoves to migrants and slum dwellers so that they could cook food and boil water, two critical requirements, in a flood-hit area.

For every account of hyper-inflated costs of water, vegetables, and airline tickets, and the government’s intervention to check these practices, there were stories of positive efforts by private entities, driven, no doubt, by civic responsibility, but also positive brand implications in the long run.

There is an untapped potential for the private sector to provide skilled services in the form of technical manpower or in-kind donations of their goods or services during emergency situations. In addition, in a situation when timing is key, a number of these agencies have local knowledge and distribution networks to help fill crucial gaps in government efforts. Rather than a one-off exercise in volunteerism, therefore, a greater collaboration between the public and private sectors is merited.

In the case of India, the newly drafted National Disaster Management Plan talks about private sector inclusion but from the perspective of businesses integrating disaster risk into their management practices and providing technical support during reconstruction efforts. Their role during emergency response is not spelt out. Through incentives and mandates, relevant businesses – not just national but also local entities– can be co-opted at the state and municipal level in disaster management initiatives.

Helping themselves

But what is in it for these companies? Businesses themselves are at risk from climate impacts during extreme weather events, in the form of supply chain disruptions, structural damage, and impacts on employees and thereby operations.

According to the CDP Global Cities Report, it is estimated that 80% of the global Gross Domestic Product is generated in cities, and assets worth $4 trillion are at risk from climate-related events in cities.

In Chennai, micro, small and medium enterprises lost an estimated Rs 1,700 crores due to the floods last year. Moreover, persistent rainfall and flooding forced several major automakers in the region to shut operations, thereby also incurring losses. It is evident that private sector efforts and investment in disaster risk resilience at every stage would not just aid cities, but help their businesses in turn too.

In May, barely five months after the floods, Chennai received 20 cm of rain in 24 hours, leaving parts of the city waterlogged. People feared the worst again. Although Cyclone Roanu, which caused the conditions that led to this excessive rain, ultimately did not hit the region, Chennai was better prepared this time with Indian Administrative Services officers, medical teams, and equipment like water pumps on standby. Such efforts at preparedness can be further complemented by co-opting private sector organisations – they are intrinsically linked to cities and have much to lose during extreme weather events, but also have much to offer to help the city get back on its feet.

The blue line of the river is 60,000 cusecs. Experts say that if 60,000 cusecs of water is released from the dam, then all these societies would be under water.Blue flood lines are the boundaries along the main river bed enough to carry one-and-a-half times the normal water flow during average floods, which occur once in 25 years. Constructions within this line are prohibited.Following a state government circular in 1989, the irrigation department in 2008 defined the high floodlines (HFL) of the Mutha river running through the city. The department surveyed the 27km stretch of the river from Khadakwasla dam to Kharadi, and came up with a detailed report mentioning the high floodlines along the river.However, a number of residential constructions had already come up within the high floodlines.""The irrigation department had sent the flood line survey to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). But the civic body did not superimpose the floodline in the Development Plan (DP) of 23 villages merged in civic limits. The PMC earmarked survey number 13 in Vitthalwadi Hingane on Sinhagad Road as a residential zone, when actually it came under floodline, which is a prohibitory zone. The Gram Panchayat had also already given many building permissions in the floodline,"" said environment activist Sarang Yadwadkar. He added that the irrigation department issued ""erroneous"" No Objection Certificates (NOC) to these buildings.""People who bought flats in these societies are not to be blamed because the land title was clear, PMC and the irrigation had issued NOCs and nationalize banks gave them loans. The PMC has to take responsibility and relocate these people,"" Yadwadkar added.""We will not move out of our flats. PMC and the irrigation department must take some steps so that there is no flooding in our societies. Why should we be punished for no fault of ours?"" resident Shravani Bobade said. She added that local MLA and corporators give assurance every year that they will do something to stop the flooding, but it never bears fruit.PMC officials and the irrigation department, meanwhile, have been passing the buck. A senior PMC official said that the irrigation department has not submitted its floodline survey as per survey numbers and hence there is confusion about marking floodlines in the DP.Irrigation officials said that they have ""fulfilled"" their responsibility of marking floodline and now the PMC must ensure that the floodline is not violated.On the ground, the actual floodline is not clearly demarcated. In 2011, the PMC and the state irrigation department together decided to mark the floodlines of Mula and Mutha rivers to demarcate river area and facilitate disaster management.As per the proposal, the PMC and the irrigation department constructed pillars in the two rivers at a distance of 200m for a stretch of 27km from Khadakwasla to Kharadi. These pillars were to have floodline marks to help the PMC incorporate the river area in the DP.""The floodline is violated and encroachments are rampant here.

On December 1, just as most residents of Defence Colony were fast asleep, flood water gushed into their homes. “Even before we could realise what was happening, the water level rose up quickly and we lost almost everything,” A.V. Bhaskar, a resident of Defence Colony in Ekkatuthangal, recollects.

Ekkattuthangal, Mana-pakkam and Ramapuram would prominently appear on the list of one of the worst affected areas during the floods last December with water submerging the ground floor of all houses.

Residents said that they were terribly disappointed and angry since they never received an alert about the release of water from the Chembarambakkam reservoir.

“Imagine water entering our premises at midnight and submerging everything in the area in less than three hours. The next morning, we could see only terraces of houses around us with everything under water; we were marooned. We dread the coming northeast monsoon,” he says.

Niranjhani Rengaraj, a resident of Manapakkam said they went without food for two days.

“Luckily, our apartment doesn’t have a ground floor and so only cars suffered damage. But we struggled without food; a hostel nearby that had stocked up food came to our rescue later,” she adds.

Residents of Manapakkam felt one of the major reasons the area suffered was because of the the Chennai airport’s secondary runway bridge which, they claimed, had prevented the free flow of water. Flood water completely inundated the runway, which lead to cancellation of several flights and left 1,500 passengers stranded.

Authorities apathetic

But even after such a major disaster, authorities seem apathetic to the crisis as much has not been done since the calamity.

“Several roads which were damaged are yet to be relaid; and if anything, in the name of carrying out work, many roads have been dug them up again. Even street lights have not been replaced yet,” Ms. Rengaraj complained.

There are a few residents who are reluctant to replace their damaged furniture fearing another deluge is in the wait. Sruthi Nakul Betarbet said, “Even months after the floods, the walls are still moist. We painted the house few months ago, but it is already peeling off.”

She said her family had insured several household items in the event of another flood. “From phones to cupboards, we have insured everything. We have even bought waterproof beds this time,” she said.

Officials of the Chennai Corporation said that they were already in the process of desilting waterbodies such as Porur lake, Kundrathur lake and Adyar river. “We have constructed stormwater drains in several areas and it is still on in many of the areas,” an official said.",flood,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 5, 2015","['Ekkattuthangal', 'Manapakkam', 'Ramapuram']","['100 mm, 150 mm, 200 mm']","['$10 billion', '$1 billion', '$500 million']","['500, 100, 50']","['10 lakh people were displaced', '1 lakh houses were damaged', '10,000 km of roads were damaged']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Monsoon rain saga continues over Pune, as weather conditions remain favourable for more spells of rains.

Rain bearing clouds have been engulfing the entire city since early Friday morning and at present, moderate showers are lashing several parts of the city. In span of mere three hours from 8:30 am to 11:30 am, Pune has recorded 25 mm of rain.

According to Skymet Weather, sky remains overcast and on and off scattered showers of varied intensity will continue over the city throughout the day. Few heavy spells are also likely in between. Nearby areas are also expected to record heavy to very heavy rains.

With this, flood threat has returned to the city. Just 24 hours back, a high alert was sounded over the city after the state irrigation department had released tons of water from the overflowing Khadakwasla Dam into Pune’s Mutha river.

However, we expect intensity of rains is likely to decrease gradually after the next 24 hours.

They also receive much less government and community support for recovery. The result: the impact of a storm, flood, drought or earthquake is more than twice as significant for poor people than anyone else.

For example, when unprecedented floods affected Mumbai in 2005, poor people lost 60 percent more than their richer neighbors—and when poor people lose the little they have, there are immediate and sometimes irreversible consequences for their health. In Ecuador, poor children exposed in utero to El Niño flooding in 1997-1998 were found to have relatively lower birthweights, shorter statures, and impaired cognitive abilities.

Proposing a new measure for assessing disaster-related damages—one that factors in the unequal burden on the poor—Unbreakable shows that natural disasters currently cost the global economy $520 billion (60 percent more than is usually reported) and force some 26 million people into poverty every year.

But there is hope. Governments can prevent millions of people from falling into extreme poverty by enacting measures that better protect the poor from natural disasters.

The report proposes a “resilience policy” package that would help poor people cope with the consequences of adverse weather and other extreme natural events. This includes early warning systems, improved access to personal banking, insurance policies, and social protection systems (like cash transfers and public works programs) that could help people better respond to and recover from shocks. Unbreakable also calls on governments to make critical investments in infrastructure, dikes, and other means of controlling water levels, and develop appropriate land-use policies and building regulations. These efforts must be specifically targeted to protect the poorest and most vulnerable citizens, not just those with higher-value assets.

The report assesses the expected benefits from these policies in 117 countries. If Angola, for example, were to introduce scalable safety nets to cover its poorest citizens, the government would see gains equaling $160 million a year. Globally, these measures combined would help countries and communities save $100 billion a year and reduce the overall impact of disasters on well-being by 20 percent.

“Countries are enduring a growing number of unexpected shocks as a result of climate change,” said Stephane Hallegatte, a GFDRR lead economist and lead author of the report. “Poor people need social and financial protection from disasters that cannot be avoided. With risk policies in place that we know to be effective, we have the opportunity to prevent millions of people from falling into poverty.”

Efforts to build poor people’s resilience are already gaining ground, the report shows. Only last month, thanks to an innovative insurance program, Haiti, Barbados, Saint Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines received a payout of $29 million in support of recovery efforts after suffering the effects of Hurricane Matthew.

Unbreakable is a roadmap to help countries better adapt to climate change, and boost the resilience and prosperity of their most vulnerable citizens. By equipping the most vulnerable with the means to cope, rebuild and rebound we can increase the chance for millions to stay out of extreme poverty.",solution,Mumbai floods,"Mumbai, India","July 26, 2005","August 11, 2005",Mumbai,944 mm,$2.6 billion,"1,000+",26 million people into poverty,Proposed a new measure for assessing disaster-related damages—one that factors in the unequal burden on the poor—Unbreakable shows that natural disasters currently cost the global economy $520 billion (60 percent more than is usually reported) and force some 26 million people into poverty every year.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Their research focused on creating a database of the city where the extent of vulnerability of each area could be outlined and categorised into zones, and the reasons behind the risk could be classified so that targeted action could be initiated.The overlay analysis of floodplain and impervious surfaces shows that 5.4 square km of urban development has taken place in high-risk flood zones. The researchers warn that there should be no further developments in these areas and there must be preparedness for rescue operations during intense rain. The researchers have also created a geographical information system (GIS) map, which shows the areas which have been subjected to flash floods over the last several years.“Large-scale land conversions, loss of lakes and occupation of floodplains have resulted in many problems like urban heat island, depletion of groundwater and, more importantly, flash floods in the city. The dumping of solid waste, laying of cables in the channels, under-potential culverts and allotment of the floodplain for housing purposes has developed vulnerability to frequent flooding,” said researchers in the study.“Increased urbanisation with intensified vertical growth of the city has led to the liquid waste disposal along storm water drains, making the run-off models unpredictable. The breach of lake embankments and overflowing lakes at the initial monsoon rains is the widespread phenomenon as the lakes are silted and saturated with sewage. The recent flood on July 29 at Kodichikkanahalli is one such example,” said the researchers, whose findings have also been published in the journal ‘Annals of GIS’.MAPping the threatThe researchers used Survey of India maps, Bhuvan web portal, open street maps, handheld GPS to identify flood locations and prepare the flood-affected zones. “The flood vulnerability map generated by us will help in the improved understanding of flash floods for local planning. It will aid in the design of remedial measures according to flood zones. It is high time for authorities to wake up and use the city’s rain by converting it as a resource and reducing surface run-off,” the researchers told Bangalore Mirror.Their assessment further shows that 65.1 square km of urban development has been done in the moderate flood-risk area. A total 136 flood locations lie in moderate flood risk zone. Among them are Anand Rao Circle, Anepalya, Begur Road, Kaval Byrasandra and Ashwath Nagar. The moderate-risk zones arise due to dumping of solid waste in drains and alteration of stream morphology. Another 68 identified locations fall in the low-risk zone. These areas could see flash floods owing to drainage congestion by solid waste dumping or use of storm water drains for wastewater disposal, faulty construction of medians and under-capacity culverts and drains. Among them are Binny Mills, BTM Layout, Konena Agrahara and Gurappanapalya.Flooding at 27 locations fall under the safe zone, said the findings. Flash floods in these areas could be attributed to engineering flaws like under-capacity bridges and culvert and improper maintenance of drains in subways. Among them are Akkipet, Mysore Bank Circle, Abbigere, Majestic and JP Nagar.",flood,Bengaluru Floods,"Bengaluru, India",2023-07-29,2023-07-30,"['Adugodi', 'Horamavu', 'Mysore Road', 'Lakshman Rao Nagar', 'Ejipura', 'Silk Board Junction', 'Indiranagar', 'Koramangala', 'Sarjapur Road', 'Shivajinagar']","['100 mm', '150 mm', '200 mm']","['Damage to property', 'Loss of life', 'Disruption of transportation']","['10', '20', '30']","['Economic loss', 'Social disruption', 'Environmental damage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

“I pray for the safety and wellbeing of those in areas affected by floods in parts of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh,” the prime minister’s office tweeted on Monday.

Madhya Pradesh is the worst-hit with over 101 people dead and around 350,000 affected. The state, which was reeling under drought until the monsoon arrived, has received more than double the normal rainfall for the period. Unprecedented rain triggered floods in 30 of its 51 districts.

The central state’s rain fury spilled over to neighbouring Rajasthan. The excess water flowing from MP has flooded the border districts of Kota, Jhalawar, Chittorgarh, Banswara and Pratapgarh.

Chittorgarh collector Inderjeet Singh said the situation was normal on Monday, but the administration is preparing for any eventuality as the weather office has predicted heavy rain for adjacent Neemuch in MP.

In Bihar, which has received less than normal rainfall, the danger comes from its rivers. The overflowing Son, which flows into the state from MP to join the Ganga, has flooded large tracts in the state.

The river has breached its banks at several places after excess water from Indrapuri Barrage was released. The situation aggravated after a spell of heavy rain on Sunday night.

“Villagers would be shifted to a safer place as the water level is rising continuously. We have provided 15 boats to affected villagers for evacuation,” said Amit Rajdeep, district disaster management officer, Sahibganj.

A fresh spell of downpour has affected over 35,000 people in Jharkhand.

In Uttarakhand, around 80 people have died this season with the latest victim being a woman said to be missing in Chamoli district following a cloudburst on Monday.

The discussion on running Mumbai as a sustainable city revolves around two major civic requirements and functions: the collection and disposal of about 9,000 tonnes of waste, and a peak power requirement of about 3,500 MW a day.

Rather than seeing them as two separate issues, the aim of civic authorities should be to find a solution that mitigates both burdens. The solution I proposed here is a model of Waste to Energy (WTE) technology that will attempt to do just this.

These solutions recognise a growing concern: the existing method of waste disposal — dumping tonnes of waste in landfills every day — is hazardous to both the environment and to the health of those living in Mumbai. A caveat too: the successful implementation of this model requires, first and foremost, effective and efficient segregation of waste at source by citizens.

Achieving this will require a system of incentives and disincentives, a carrot-and-stick approach, which I will also attempt to explain in this piece.

The garbage problem

Mumbai generates approximately 9,000 TPD (tonnes per day) of municipal solid waste (MSW), or nearly 0.475 kg per person, according to data provided by the BMC. This is expected to exceed 10,000 tonnes per day by 2025.

Most of this gets transported to three dumping grounds at Deonar, Mulund and Gorai. (A new site is proposed at Kanjur Village to accommodate the increase in waste.) At present, Deonar receives about 4,000 TPD of waste from the eastern suburbs, dumped without any treatment; Mulund receives around 600 TPD from the city and eastern suburbs; and Gorai gets about 1,200 TPD from the western suburbs. These sites are nearing the end of their usable life and carrying capacity.

The recyclable components in this waste are mainly plastic, paper, cartons, polystyrene (what we inaccurately call Thermocol or Styrofoam, which are brand names), glass, rubber, leather, and metals. Some of these are combustible and have a significant calorific value (heat content). After separation of recyclables at source and at secondary storage, around 18.6 per cent remains.

In India, the major portion — around 56 per cent — of urban MSW is organic matter. (The actual percentage of recyclables discarded as waste in India is unknown due to informal picking of waste, which is generally not accounted for.) Organic matter is suitable for aerobic digestion where the waste can be used to create compost, or anaerobic digestion and fermentation under controlled conditions, where it can be diverted to produce biomethane. This, in turn, can be used for electricity generation.

Biogas technology has emerged as a key environmental technology for integrated solid and liquid waste treatment concepts and climate protection in both industrialised and developing countries. With anaerobic conversion or fermentation, over 90 per cent of the energy available in the wastes is retained within the biogas as methane, and the rest is sludge. This process takes place in enclosed reactors called digesters. A digester can turn a tonne of MSW into 100 m³ of biogas for electricity production.

The power problem

Mumbai has a unique power requirement and load curves. The average daily requirement of electricity is about 60 million units (MU). The peak power demand is almost 3,500 MW and average demand is about 3,100 MW. Mumbai’s own generation is about 2,200 MW, produced by two generation utilities in Mumbai city, Reliance Infra (capacity: 500 MW) and Tata Power (1,700 MW), and distributed by them as well as the BEST Undertaking (which has no generation capacity).

Being India’s financial capital, Mumbai’s needs 24/7/365 electricity supply. The supply-demand shortfall is met through external power purchases, which are very costly. Hence, the overall retail tariff for power is very high compared to other Indian cities, which is a very serious concern for citizens.

Setting up Waste-To-Energy plants

The gap between Mumbai’s peak power demand (3,500MW) and generation capacity (2,200 MW) can be bridged with WTE plants. The Waste to Energy (WTE) can be configured in many ways, and the best current option has the following components:

Use the existing landfill site areas to set up a solar water preheating platform to preheat water to 90 degrees Celsius.

Transport this hot water to the power generation plant (offshore).

Set up an anaerobic digester to digest the segregated wet waste for the generation of biomethane (or use the existing matured landfill sites for tapping the generated methane).

Transport and burn this methane in a boiler (part of the offshore power plant) to produce superheated steam from the solar preheated water platform.

Run the steam turbine connected to the alternator to produce electricity to be fed to the grid.

The cost of generating green energy from waste is around Rs. 2/kWh. Energy from WTE plants can partially fulfill the city's peak energy demand. Our daily green energy generation potential is about 3.5 MU. This can save the city the cost of about five per cent of external power it currently purchases. An annual generation of 1,300 MU (million units) of energy can be achieved.

Where will we find the space for WTE plants, considering the extreme paucity of space in Mumbai and the resulting high cost of land?

Assuming the successful implementation of the carrot-and-stick model (described below), effectively segregated municipal waste will be deposited in the existing landfill sites. Their total area of 322 hectares (Deonar 132, Mulund 25, Gorai 24, Kanjur 141) can then be used as solar water-heating platforms in addition to being waste collection centres.

In this proposal, existing landfills are used as part of a solar heating platform. Two WTE power plants can be set up at locations in the sea in the vicinity of the existing landfills, which will make getting boiler water to the WTE plant very easy. And this will not disturb either the existing city infrastructure or the transportation of collected MSW.

Moreover, preheating boiler water by using solar energy will further reduce the overall carbon footprint. Of course, the overall efficiency of the plant can and will be improved as technology advances.

The carrot-and-stick model

Anaerobic digestion is an ideal method for exploitation of electric power from the organic part of MSW. To do this, waste must be segregated first. To achieve this, sorting and separating organic and inorganic waste must be done at the first stage, i.e., where waste is generated. This is why it is important to incentivise segregation at the citizen level.

Several waste segregation initiatives have been attempted, with little success.

What if stakeholders were assigned different tasks and responsibilities? What if financial incentives were to be included with each task? And what if there were some concrete disincentives for defaulters?

For example, if BMC generates electricity from waste, it would be in its interest to encourage segregation. It could do this with a combination of incentives, sharing the benefits with citizens, and penalties.

Each unit of dwelling or commerce — buildings, housing colonies, hotels, restaurants, shops, markets — must register itself with the BMC at local ward offices. These ward offices will then distribute garbage bags — grey for dry waste and green for wet — in proportion to the number of people in each of these units. Every day, everyone must fill their bags correctly. The BMC’s existing network will collect these bags and will also keep a daily record of the number of bags collected. At the end of each month, the total waste collected from each unit colony, as recorded by the local BMC officer, will get converted into credit points for the units — one credit point for every 10 kg of green bag waste from dwelling units and one credit for 15 kg of waste garbage from commercial units. Then, 10 credits would be exchanged for one unit of electricity.

At the same time, those citizens and enterprises who fail to separate their dry and wet waste will be penalised. The garbage of such defaulters will not be collected from their premises. A BMC-authorised officer will warn such defaulters, and then stop collection from them if they fail to comply.

Mumbai can lead the way

Through selling the electricity to the Mumbai grid and providing citizens with credits with which they can pay their electricity bills, our local government can earn profits, which in turn can help them incentivise other primary public services like education, health and transportation within the city.

This case for a sustainable Mumbai has a large implication on policy. The city could be the ideal platform for a WTE project that partially meets peak demand of electricity. Learning from here can help to establish effective similar models across the country. As ever, Mumbai can help, literally and metaphorically, electrify India.

What is the city's waste made of:

*54% Biodegradable wet waste (Food leftover)

*15% Biodegradable dry waste (Wood, cloth etc)

*12% Sand, stone and fine earth particles

*10% Paper, metels,and other reusable waste

*9% Plastic

Mumbai’s garbade pile

*9,000 TPD (tonnes per day) of municipal solid waste (MSW) approximately generated by Mumbai, or around 0.475 kg per person

*10,000 TPD expected increase by 2025

*4,000 TPD Deonar receives waste from the eastern suburbs

*1,200 TPD Gorai gets from the western suburbs

*600 TPD Mulund receives from the city and eastern suburbs

The power scene

*2,200 MW Power generation

*Peak power demand: nearly 3,500 MW

*Average demand: about 3,100 MW

Power producers

*500 MW Reliance Infra

*1,700 MW Tata Power

The gap between peak power demand and generation capacity can be bridged with WTE plants.

City can generate 3.5 million units of green energy generation a day, and save 5% in external power costs.

A spectre, to misquote Karl Marx, it appears, is haunting India’s new urbanisation — the spectre of agrarian pasts. In the last 15 years, it has repeatedly stalked Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Guwahati, Srinagar in the form of urban floods. Again, to take liberties with Marx, all the powers of politics, business and technology have apparently entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre — recklessly code named as “nature”. The code serves to absolvea us of guilt. We just need to build smartphone apps to give us early warnings of nature’s mischief. In the worst case scenario, we have the favourite whipping boys — planners — to take all the blame. Neither is nature autonomous from human action, nor is there any masterplan which is free from politics and corporate interest. The fault lies in forgetting our agricultural past and ignoring climate change. It took us centuries to develop the complex systems of values assigned to lands in the agrarian settlement. These values are based on soil conditions, gradient, location relative to other geographic and geological features such as ground water, surface water, drainage patterns etc. Lands were strategically exploited for production, left fallow to recover, left unoccupied to provide buffers against the cycles of excesses of nature. Urbanisation alters this agrarian imprint with new logics of efficiency and economy of service delivery. This is why cadastral maps of an agrarian settlement show fluid zigzag boundaries of property. After land use conversion for urbanisation, the boundaries change into rigid geometric patterns. New logics of revenue categories, new processes of record maintenance, reservation of land parcels for new purposes and installation of new infrastructure erase the agrarian birthmarks of land. Urban policy has, till now, remained oblivious to this dynamic.

During the past few days, several areas in East as well as Central India have witnessed flood like conditions. In fact, the state of Madhya Pradesh has been reeling under intense floods as heavy to very heavy rains continued to lash the state.

Now, it is the capital city of Bihar, Patna’s turn to face the flood fury as River Ganga has swollen. On Saturday and Sunday, flood waters entered many parts of the city. The bad news doesn’t end here.

In fact, as per the Central Water Commission, the water levels in the Ganga River will continue to rise for at least the next 3 to 4 days. On Saturday, many apartments built in the low lying areas were submerged in water as water entered the LCT Ghat in Mainpura.

The Indrapuri barrage in Rohtas district discharged 11.67 lakh cusecs of water into the Sone water adding to the already grim situation in Patna and adjoining districts of Bihar. As per state authorities, 13 people have lost their lives until now.

These conditions have affected about 50,000 people in Patna alone. So much so that 10,000 people were rescued as water entered homes and buildings. Other districts to have been affected include Samastipur, Vaishali, Buxar, Bhojpur, Lakhi Sarai, Khagaria, Begusarai, Munger and Katihar.

Several teams of both the State Disaster Response Force and the National Disaster Response Force have been deployed. At least a 1,000 country boats have also been put to use adding on to the inflatable boats used the by the Disaster Response Forces.

Conditions are expected to remain grim for the next 24 hours as well because several parts in Bihar are expected to receive more rains due to multiple weather systems.

But now it has emerged that as the city expanded, more than 150 water bodies, that were part of a flood mitigating system in the city and its suburbs, were encroached and turned into human habitation. The result was there to see: Plum real estate ventures in Mudichur and Tambaram went under water.According to a study done by CareEarth Trust (a Chennai-based biodiversity research organisation), only 15% of the city's wetlands are left, down from the 80% when Chennai's area was lesser.The researcher, Prem V , has analysed the spatiotemporal variations, specially focussing on wetland and built-up land of the Chennai metropolitan area from 1980 to 2010.As per the findings, the built-up area of the city was 47.62sqkm in 1980, only 20%, while the wetlands were spread over 186.30sqkm (see maps). In 1991, the built-up area increased three-fold, 152.33sqkm, and almost equalled the wetland spread which in the 11 years had come down to 159.41sqkm.The IT boom at the turn of the millennium triggered a construction boom in the southern parts of the city to accommodate offices; and to house techies the real estate business flourished in the vicinity. Over the years, the city expanded and outskirts like OMR and Perungudi transformed. As concrete replaced the shrublands and dry lake beds, the built-up area increased. In 2000, it was 250.58sqkm (68%) when compared to the 117.48sqkm of the wetlands. A decade later, the built-up area touched 402.10sqkm (85%) and the wetlands had shrunk to 71.05sqkm (15%).The study found that most of the water bodies affected were in the southern and western suburbs. The areas where the water bodies were encroached, some institutionally, included Tambaram, Perungalathur, Vandalur, Ramapuram, Manappakkam, Valasaravakkam, Ambattur, Alandur and Adyar. Incidentally, several of these areas were hit hard by the December deluge.According to the study, buffer areas of a lake are the first casualties of rapid urbanisation. Known as odai porambokku and yeri porambokku in Tamil ­ meaning rivulet across a wasteland and lake on a wasteland respectively - these buffer areas connected lakes and drained excess water from one water body into another. These channels formed an integral part of a natural flood mitigating system, but over time, with the lakes dry, these were encroached upon, the study said. Also, pastoral land adjoining the lakes acted as floodplains during monsoon. With the channels and farmlands gone, flooding was imminent.As a conservation-oriented study, the research provides a road map for the government to protect the wetlands from further degradation. Six years ago the Union ministry of environment and forests enacted Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules 2010. One of the key features of this legislation was powers vested in the state machinery to determine the “wise“ use of water bodies.

It was still raining but not in the city-stopper way of July 26. Electricity was erratic, phones were still down, and the floods of groundwater had contaminated our underground tank. We collected water in buckets from the torrents streaming down our rainwater pipes. Clean, sweet water. The days past had washed our terrace and pipes, again and again. We could drink this water. We were among the lucky ones.



Unlike us, there were so many who were caught in transit – in trains, in buses or in private vehicles who had to stick it out, some for more than 24 hours, without water or food or access to toilet. There were some who had to scramble to the upper deck of a double-decker BEST bus to escape the rising waters. Ditto for the trains, though in come cases passengers were forced by the rising tide to get off and wade their way to higher ground. This was a particularly risky exercise. They made their way slowly, in human chains, both to avoid invisible pitfalls and to brace themselves against the force of the flowing floodwaters. Boats were pressed into service as well as rafts, anything that floated, essentially. Benevolent citizens selflessly rescued those trapped or brought flood and water to those who could not leave their vehicles.



When it was all over, the rains left behind detritus and carcasses – animal and human. People died. By drowning, or by asphyxiation in cars with auto locks that failed to open. In vehicles that were overwhelmed with floodwater. In an attempt to navigate waist-deep water and not being able to detect open manholes or pits. By being washed away by the force of the deluge. Through electrocution. Through mudslides. Garbage floated alongside the dead. The sea returned the rubbish we had put into it.



Caught unawares



The deluge of July 26, 2005 did take most of the city unawares. By 2.30 in the afternoon, most of us had reached a slow awareness that this was not your average Mumbai rain day. We are used to the washouts that occur every monsoon. Indeed, even in 2005, there were some bad days. The combination of one day’s unforeseen downpour with an afternoon high tide, combined with less than optimum drainage, ended up with the city overwhelmed in several places. The trains were the first to stall.



The architecture college where I teach is on relatively higher ground. Even so, water swept through our campus, though it did not accumulate. The high plinth was enough to keep our shoes dry. The area around Crawford Market was spared the worst. Even the Irani and Udupi cafes remained open, as along as their supplies lasted. Higher ground meant everything, and on that day we got a glimpse of what rising sea levels would probably mean in a changed climate.



Some of us who thought best to leave early for home that day reached the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus only to find it full of passengers and devoid of trains. We made our way back to the campus with our tail between our legs. Over the next two days we would try to attempt this again, unsuccessfully. By the night of July 26, there was a motley presence in the college, a bunch of teachers and students, administrative staff and watchmen. The rooms, studios and offices were all left open to those who had the good sense not to attempt the journey home.



I slept for two nights on the vast colonial era desk of the principal’s office. The principal, a diminutive gent, did not take this amiss, preferring a small sofa that ergonomically accommodated him. I did keep an eye out for some large rats, nearly the size of bandicoots, who also sought refuge in the building. For us, these were two days of minor inconvenience and some adventure. Not so for so many others.



No lessons learnt



A decade on, this year, we had one bad rain day on June 19 and the city surrendered abjectly. For a while it seemed like July 26 had revisited us. In the end it was only hubris in full display. The combined learnings of the Great Mumbai Flood and its aftermath had come to nothing. For the first time since 2005, all trains – on Western, Central and Harbour lines – stalled simultaneously. Even the main arterial roads were rendered unfit for buses and other vehicles. What prevented this day from becoming worse was that this time the rains peaked the night before, and most Mumbaikars sensibly decided to call it a day before it had even begun.



The enthusiasm of bringing change that erupted a decade ago has long since evaporated. Desilting and removal of garbage from the storm water drains was, as always, found wanting. The much-vaunted BRIMSTOWAD, or the Brihanmumbai Storm Water Disposal System, which was to increase the diameter of the storm drains and install strategic pumping stations, has been implemented only fitfully. What has been seen most clearly are project cost increases.



Back in 2005, it seemed as if nothing was spared. Fifty kilometres from south Mumbai, the ravages of the two days in July were seen in Panvel. With the waters coming down with relentless force from the Sahyadri peaks surrounding this end of Navi Mumbai, the floodgates of the Morbe dam had to be opened by the afternoon of July 26, leading to inundation of the old town of Panvel. Once again elevation got the advantage, as the eastern parts of the New Panvel node were spared. The old city, its lakes and temples and marketplaces all went under.



A month later, I was able to see some footage of that day, mostly recorded by amateurs and some local TV channels. At the main road of Panvel Gaon, popularly called Mahatma Gandhi Road, the waters lapped buildings' first floors 10 or 12 feet high. The 160-year-old Beth El Synagogue had only its sloped roof out of the water. Later it would have to be restored extensively and all the objects of worship replaced. Devastation was total. The footage continued the day after, recording receding waters.



An enterprising cameraman walked the street, recording the aftermath, talking to acquaintances he encountered. At one point, he entered a house that had just been drained of the floodwater. As he took in the smashed furniture, kitchenware and mattresses, his otherwise steady hand shook. “Ram,” he said as light fell upon swollen bodies – householders, who had not been able to escape in time. “Ram,” he kept repeating, his voice trembling as he recorded, “Ram...”

But are we certain that we would be safer, better protected and more informed if the city were to again receive rainfall as it did on that fateful day in July 2005, a record 944mm in 24 hours? Going by the status update we receive from the government and media every July, it appears that Mumbai could be rendered just as helpless and unsafe as it was then. Has Srinagar learned its lessons, will Chennai learn? As long as urban floods are defined as these once-in-a-century events, the lessons will be missed.

The extremely intense floods such as Mumbai 2005 and Chennai this year may be unusual phenomena brought on by a rare combination of meteorological, hydrological and human factors, but urban flooding is more common than we realise it to be. Indeed, repeated incidences of urban floods in the last decade are as follows: Mumbai (nine times), Chennai (six times), Hyderabad (five times), Ahmedabad (seven times), Kolkata (five times), Bengaluru (four times) and Surat (thrice). This does not include Delhi, Srinagar and other metros, which have experienced floods fewer times.

That urban flooding is significantly different from rural flooding, calls for an altered flood management approach, and its management must be dovetailed into urban planning itself were recognised five years ago in the exhaustive guidelines developed, after years of consultations with multiple central and state agencies, by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). It reaffirmed the causes of urban flooding: Rampant land-use changes, unregulated construction without accounting for natural water flows (such as the airports in Mumbai and Chennai), encroachments, sealing off natural drainage systems such as rivers and lakes, ageing storm water drains, improper waste disposal, and ineffective warning and information systems.

The guidelines have remained on paper. The separate nodal unit that the NDMA had recommended to be set up within the Ministry of Urban Development to deal with urban floods is not yet a reality. While the ministry goes about making smart cities with a ferocious energy, it misses or overlooks the need to account for urban flooding in a methodical manner, and get states and urban planning agencies excited about it.

The relationship between urban flooding and human encroachments on natural eco-systems is now too obvious. Mumbai has nearly 60% more built-up land today than it did 90 years ago, its river systems are seen more clearly on a map than in reality, and its lakes are smaller than ever. The story of urban development is similar in Srinagar, Chennai, Hyderabad, Guwahati and other cities that witnessed frequent urban floods in the last decade.

To continue to rapidly urbanise and expand our cities without factoring in urban flooding now would be a foolish thing to do indeed. With climate change phenomenon making urban floods the new normal, urban development plans would have to include ways to prevent such floods as well as create flood management systems. There is little evidence of this in Mumbai’s planning. The 2005 flood is treated as a one-off episode. Nothing could be more disastrous.

It took a fair while for the Indian media, particularly television, to move attention away from the usual stories. Some of these were of consequence of course. But mostly it was the predictable cacophony of the inane and the asinine.

The story on the floods was swept away, perhaps because there was little scope for ‘outrage’, I suppose.

It is not the brief of this column to critique the media. This would also tantamount to self-flagellation so I’ll leave it at that. But a comment from an Aussie journalist, when we discussed the floods, was quite profound: “So much of what we call ‘natural tragedies’ are preventable, if we understand nature and learn to live with it.”

From a Mumbai perspective, the devastating floods in south India can only ring many alarm bells. It’s almost as if this was to be expected. The unimaginable rains of July 2005 aside, flooding, destruction and disruption are recurring.

As is now emerging, the problems for both Mumbai and Chennai seem distressingly similar as well: unpreparedness of authority, rampant construction and complete lack of foresight.

Even as several nations are arguing over the effects and responsibilities of climate change in Paris right now, citizens of Chennai are feeling the brunt of a planet that is hitting back. And we in Mumbai can’t afford to be casual: nor indeed any city in the country.

Years ago, we were warned of extreme weather events by climate change experts but too many governments decided to ignore the warnings or to dismiss them. To be fair, this was not restricted to India, but across the world.

Yet the argument in India changed subtly to a pernicious logic – if you spoke up for the environment, you were anti-development.

Why being circumspect through knowledge and experience is anti-progress has hardly been explained.

And frankly, this need not necessarily be the responsibility of enterpreneurs and businessmen. Except for the most conscientious, their focus understandably will be to find opportunities for profit or creating wealth and move on to the next project.

The power to provide clearances for these projects lies with civic/state/national authorities. These must be held to account. For reasons of ignorance or hubris, they’ve been the most culpable. Consequently, every big city and small town in India faces the same issues that Chennai is now suffering from.

Our civic authorities are unable to comprehend that if you destroy mangroves, marshlands, wetlands, block nullahs in the inner city from their natural path into the sea (in the case of Mumbai and Chennai, certainly), litter the city with non-destructible waste, among other things, then there is nowhere for floodwater to go and disaster beckons.

In the Mumbai context, the issue is not just about the land reclaimed from the sea or the salt pans on which new suburbs have, and continue to be built; it is also about how the existing city is being recast.

It is, therefore, as much about mid-town areas like Grant Road and Bhendi Bazar for instance, as it is about Mira Road, Bhayander, Virar et al.

The message is clear from Mumbai on July 26, 2005, and Chennai now: If you do not take geographical and geological factors into consideration in the race to develop and destroy natural checks and balances without study or remedy, the consequences could be catastrophic.",,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",1 December 2015,5 December 2015,Chennai city and suburbs,494 mm (19.4 in),"Rs. 10,000 crore (US$1.4 billion)",464,"18 lakh people were displaced, 10,000 houses were damaged or destroyed, and 50,000 vehicles were damaged","The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage, and deforestation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

A row of aircraft sits in a carpet of grey, water lapping their nose cones. The airfield is inundated, with the red-and-white traffic control tower craning its neck out.If it hasn’t already, the image of the submerged Chennai International Airport should set the alarm bells ringing in the offices of CIDCO, or the City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra. A town planning agency wholly owned by the Maharashtra government, CIDCO is building a “world class” airport near Panvel, an extended suburb of Mumbai, despite loud protestations. Environmentalists have long warned that constructing the Navi Mumbai International Airport on ecologically fragile terrain, over one river and close to another, could spell disaster.Perhaps CIDCO will pay attention now.As an intense downpour lashed Chennai, its airport runway disappeared under water and all operations were fully suspended on December 2. Operations resumed on Monday, five days later. Economic losses are yet to be calculated, but they’ll likely run into crores. The India Meteorological Department has warned that rains may continue for a few more days due to a “trough of low” pressure over southwest Bay of Bengal, off the Tamil Nadu coast.Environmentalists say they had cautioned against the flooding of Chennai airport, which is built on the floodplains of River Adyar. Its second runway runs over the river itself, with a bridge constructed across Adyar extending the runway’s length by 1,400 metres to a total of 3,445 metres. “The bridge accommodates the runway and a taxiway, making Chennai Airport the only international airport in India to have a runway across a river,” boasts the airport’s Wikipedia page The bridge was constructed above the water levels during the 2005 flood in the southern city, but it failed to take into consideration freak weather events. So, when the skies opened up in November and Adyar overflowed, it spread the excess rainwater on the airport runway to reclaim its original path.“Chennai is not an isolated example,” said Parineeta Dandekar, associate coordinator of the South Asian Network on Dams, Rivers and People. “All our cities, such as Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Pune and Delhi, have encroached upon their water bodies and riverbeds, leaving very little space for water to flow. Freak weather events are on the rise and when it rains very heavily, it is natural for the river to carry the excess water and follow its original course.“Floodplains are an integral part of the river ecosystem. During heavy rain, floodplains come alive and absorb the floodwater. They not only regulate floods but also maintain hydrograph of the river by slowly releasing water into the river [thus mitigating drought] and purifying water through riparian vegetation.”

CIDCO says the Navi Mumbai International Airport will be among the world’s largest greenfield international airports, offering world-class facilities to passengers and airlines alike. To be built at a cost of Rs 14,574 crore, the core area of the airport requires 1,160 hectare.The planned airport has been embroiled in controversy from the beginning. For its site, the authorities chose a site 60 kilometres from Mumbai that falls under coastal regulation zone, where construction activities are banned or regulated.In June 2009, the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests had raised objections when it found that the airport will come up on 150 hectare of mangroves and 340 hectare of coastal marshland, including 118 hectare of water body. The proposed site is a low-lying land and has two rivers – Ghadi and Ulwe – flowing through it before draining into the Panvel creek. Whereas Ghadi river flows along the boundary of the proposed airport, Ulwe cuts rights across the two proposed runways.As per the environmental impact assessment conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay and Pune’s Central Water and Power Research Station, Ghadi river would be “trained”, while Ulwe river would be “diverted” at a right angle (see map below). A 90-metre hillock that is obstructing the safe landing and take-off of aircrafts would also be flattened , and the soil and debris from the hillock would be used to reclaim the low-lying marshland.



The proposed development plan of the Navi Mumbai International Airport.

Source: CIDCO website

Raising serious questions on the project, the Environment Ministry had informed the then Union aviation minister, through a letter dated June 17, 2009, that the identified area was of great ecological value and “…no compensatory afforestation is possible to substitute for the loss of these mangroves”.A year later, on May 5, 2010, a public hearing was held in Panvel, which was boycotted by all the 18 villages affected by the airport project. They were demanding due compensation and an attractive relief and rehabilitation package. Still, in November 2010, thirteen years after the project was first proposed, the Environment Ministry cleared the Navi Mumbai International Airport with riders for CIDCO, including compensatory plantation and protection of 615 hectare mangroves.CIDCO missed the 2014 deadline for the first phase of the airport and the pre-development work – levelling the ground, cutting the hillock and reclaiming the marshland – is yet to begin. The deadline has now been pushed to 2019 as land acquisition is still incomplete. Nevertheless, a mangrove park that was to be developed adjacent to the airport has been relocated , and CIDCO is demanding exemption from the coastal regulation zone norms.Despite the warning signs from Chennai, Sanjay Bhatiya, managing director of CIDCO, insists that “there is no problem at all with Navi Mumbai airport”. “We are constructing proper drainage systems, holding ponds, etc which will drain excess water into the sea,” he said. “We got a very high level scientific study done by an institution which has recommended flood control mechanisms and other precautions. We are following those.”Nevertheless, environmentalists want a review. “Keeping in mind the recent flooding of Chennai’s airport, the delay of NMIA appears more like an opportunity to rethink the environmental costs of the proposed airport project, which will tweak two rivers, flatten a hillock and destroy mangroves,” said Rishi Aggarwal, a Mumbai-based environmentalist.Aggarwal cautioned that mangroves are the best natural protection against floods and provide localised benefits. “Just because IIT-Bombay has conducted EIA [environmental impact assessment] of the Navi Mumbai airport, it does not make the project sacrosanct,” he said. “The solutions of IIT-Bombay are heavy engineering solutions and don’t include the ecosystem services provided by rivers and mangroves.”In July 2005, when Mumbai was inundated , the city airport was flooded and shut down as the Mithi river, whose course had been changed to build the runway, breached the airport wall and started flowing through the airport.Dandekar says the flooding of Chennai airport should serve as a wakeup call for the Union Environment Ministry, which is sitting on the river regulation zone notification for the last six years. “The proposed RRZ would divide river courses into various ecozones depending on the climatic conditions, state of degradation, human use and potential for restoration,” she said. “It would restrict construction activities on the floodplains and regulate other activities along the rivers.”Several developed countries have realised that urban floods cannot be controlled by heavy engineering solutions alone. The Netherlands, a low-lying country, has a unique Room for the River Programme whose aim is to give the river more room to to manage higher water levels. Its government is spending €2.3 billion in over 30 crucial river locations, protecting 4 million people living in flood-prone areas.Similarly, the United States Department of Agriculture has an “Emergency Watershed Protection Program–Floodplain Easement Option”, which restores, protects, maintains and enhances the functions of floodplains while conserving their natural values. Structures, including buildings, within the floodplain easement are removed, or relocated outside the 100-year floodplain or dam breach inundation area.Chennai floods are a strong reminder that we, too, must learn to make room for our rivers.Nidhi Jamwal is a Mumbai-based freelance environment journalist.

Across India, city after city has experienced floods, while some others live with the fear of impending disasters. In Mumbai, flooding was caused by wrong developments at the Bandra estuary and negligence along the Mithi river, and in Uttarakhand the disaster was caused by unplanned regional development and the unholy nexus between the land mafia and politicians. The Srinagar valley suffers from an unfortunate geographical disadvantage of being the recipient of water from an enormous watershed above the valley. Water bodies in and around Chennai have been filled up, leaving no space for rainwater to escape when it pours. The deluge and the repercussions have lessons for us for future urban planning.(Reuters File)

Meanwhile, in Delhi, the two governments are merrily building on the city’s flood plains, ignoring the ministry of environment, which is supposed to protect the Delhi Ridge and the Yamuna river. Calcutta’s new growth is entirely in the wetland area, creating multiple infrastructure barriers for surface water flow from the mother city, which in any case has a lower elevation than the Hooghly river. In the past decades, Bangalore’s expansion had been at the cost of an elaborate pond system in the sub-region, a majority of the scattered ponds being built upon by land sharks. The Bruhat Bangalore Development Plan came too late, while artificial land values were created by project-driven infrastructure. In other words, all our metropolitan cities have ignored watershed management and environmental planning to their own peril. This is the juncture in India’s urbanisation when thousands of crores are being poured into the urban centres, coupled with a policy shift in the Environmental Impact Assessment in order to facilitate ‘growth’ for easing the sanction process. All these are also ‘Smart Cities’, ‘AMRUT Cities’ and investment destinations for ambitious metro projects and they are identified as new growth centres of our ‘surging’ economy. In the absence of a proper National Policy for Urbanisation, our metropolitan cities are sitting ducks for all sorts of natural disasters. Spineless local planning organisations, which are subservient to their administrative and political masters, are not willing to put their technical know-how on the table, for fear of punishment transfers and mafia-induced pressures.

The Chennai floods show all these problems can surface in other Indian cities. The geography of South India demonstrates how rivulets, ponds, streams and rivers emanating from the Western Ghats flow towards the East to the Tamil Nadu coast. On the other hand, this coast is also highly vulnerable to storms, depression, tsunami and floods. Chennai is one such area where an enormous watershed finally drains into the sea through its rivers and canals. Has any regional planning exercise recognised this primary natural layer on which urban development forms the secondary layer? No. On the contrary, the watershed on the west of Chennai has been the major venue for industrialisation in corridors going up to Kanchipuram further to the west.

Traditionally the sub-region surrounding Chennai had big and small ponds connected by a working overflow system. The water was allowed to spread into fields and thousands of smaller ponds, with the entire region acting as a ‘sponge’ to absorb the excess water, supporting paddy fields and fish farming. These overflow systems and multiple canals finally find their way to lakes that surround Chennai city. Finally the rivers in Chennai absorb this flow.

In Tamil Nadu’s hurry to industrialise, these watershed areas have been ravaged, with all the major industries, new educational institutions, housing estates, etc. coming up in the past two decades. Thousands of smaller ponds and streams have been filled up, increasing the surface water flow manifold. The major tanks are silted and the amount of water flowing into them has increased. This increased run-off has found its way into the city. Unprecedented rain, induced by climate change, has compounded the problem. While the disaster has been caused by nature, the impact would not have been so severe but for the man-made factors.

The second dimension of Chennai’s flood is another man-made (read planning-made) problem. The Adyar river in the south of the original city had a wide estuary and also a wide flood plain. Many areas south of the river have been marshy and low-lying, serviced by small rivulets and canals. Most submerged areas with floor-high water are on this part of the city, including the IT Park and many multinational corporate headquarters, paralysing business not only in Chennai but across the country and outside.

All the swamps, marsh lands, low-lying areas and streams that these big corporations, middle class housing and slums have built on are inundated as they are at the receiving end of overflowing large regional tanks.

The planned developments along the Adyar river that reduced its capacity as a water outlet are largely government-sponsored as the river bed was in government ownership. In the past three decades, massive housing, planned and unplanned, has cannibalised the river bed, leading to increased flooding, and damaged Chennai’s technology nerve centres and put millions of residents in danger. Chennai is indeed a sordid story of all the ills that plague India’s subservient planning system. Our inability to enforce environmental laws and insatiable greed for land grabbing by both national and international commercial interests are in full play in Chennai. The silver lining, however, is the enormous outflow of altruism, public mindedness and compassion Chennai’s citizens have displayed in the face of this calamity.

Pinning responsibility for faulty planning and political decisions, preparing a scientific watershed management plan, putting in place a disaster warning system, and addressing the immediate problems of the urban poor are the first steps forward. Chennai’s citizens have a resurgent spirit. That indeed is the human capital to build on.

103: Water bodies facing encroachment, dumping of waste and summertime evaporation loss

On June 20 this year, when Mumbai got 283 mm of rain in 24 hours and the Mithi River was at the danger mark, 25-year-old Kiran Shinde received an advisory from a non-governmental organisation to vacate his home. Shinde, who stays in a colony along the Mithi in the city's north-west, considers himself lucky the rains stopped in a few hours.On the same day, Aslam Sheikh, who stays in the flood-prone areas in Kurla in north-east Mumbai, was making desperate calls to friends and family for urgent help to move his wife to a hospital in Thane. His neighbours arranged for a makeshift boat to transport his wife to a nearby taxi stand.Shinde, Sheikh and many others in the city's commercial capital say every time they see dark clouds, their minds go numb, courtesy the July 26, 2005, floods when a little over 1,000 people died in the city. The overarching fear is that such disasters could again strike, unless the state government and the civic body implement a detailed disaster management plan on a war footing. The Chennai floods have compounded that fear.Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's (BMC) former commissioner Sitaram Kunte says a lot of work on improving storm-water drainage (SWD) has been done after 2005, based on the recommendations of a high-powered committee chaired by water expert Madhav Chitale. However, he adds the full effect will be felt ""only after all the components are fully completed"".That last bit of comment is not unfounded. A civic official admits unplanned rampant urbanisation, loss of water bodies due to encroachments, dilapidated water drainage systems that lead to silting and choking can lead to flooding in heavy rain. Landfills, reclamation and quarrying of hills to meet so-called development needs have altered the city's topography completely.The core of the city's present SWD system is about 70 years old, comprising 400 km of underground drains, which can handle 25 mm of rains per hour at low tide. If the rain intensity is more and high tide occurs, there is always a possibility of heavy waterlogging. However, Kunte says all new SWDs have been designed to absorb 50 mm/hour rainfall intensity and a master plan for drains' construction is being implemented but he says the main constraint is the slums and structures along the alignment of these drains.""The entire BMC area has been contour-mapped. Computer modelling of all watersheds has also been done. Thus, a lot of work on improving SWDs has been done after 2005,"" says Kunte.The reality is more complex. BMC's much-debated Brihanmumbai Storm-water Drainage (Brimstowad) project, which aims to upgrade the old system, is behind schedule. The project was proposed and planned after the floods in 1985, when the entire city was flooded due to heavy rain. Meanwhile, the project cost has escalated to Rs 4,000 crore from the initial Rs 1,200 crore estimate. Eight pumping stations with heavy duty pumps to discharge storm-water were also planned, of which four have been commissioned, two are under construction and another two are awaiting various clearances.Conservation Action Trust executive trustee Debi Goenka says Brimstowad is not going to solve the drainage problems of Mumbai's suburbs; in fact, he contends, this would make it worse. ""Brimstowad is essentially converting the natural creeks into concrete canals. Walls have been built on the sides that are stopping sea water from spreading into the mangrove areas, killing them. New buildings and slums are sprouting along these canals, as roads have been built along the walls on both sides. In the event of a flood, the sea water will now penetrate deeper into the city and aggravate the flooding,"" he opines.Mithi's development and its protection are also moving at a snail's pace. The poor state of the river (also known as the Mahim River) in 2005 was blamed by many for exacerbating the flood disaster. Officials at BMC and the state urban development department say the storm-water drainage for the Mithi's catchment areas is disturbed due to encroachment of hutments, processing industries, workshops and scrapyards situated along its banks. ""Direct discharge of untreated sewage, wastewater from unauthorised settlements and industrial effluents along the river's course are a cause of concern,"" an official notes.Government officials hope the Mithi River Development and Protection Authority's proposal to increase the catchment height of the Powai Lake in north-west Mumbai by up to four metre in places might well keep floodwater away from the river in times of heavy rainfall. About Rs 1,200 crore has been spent till now on development activities of the Mithi but the work remains non-satisfactory.Recently, State Environment Minister Ramdas Kadam reviewed the Mithi rejuvenation plan and pulled up the departments concerned for continuing use of the river as a dumping ground for sewage, industrial waste and garbage from those living along its banks.Kunte says Mumbai 2005 and Chennai 2015 are warning signs we all should heed.

Floods are bad news for vehicle owners because if the water levels rise so high that it enters the vehicle, from the upholstery to the engine, serious damage may be caused. Plying vehicles face the same danger. Even your homes can get damaged. But if you have a comprehensive car insurance or house insurance policy, there is help at hand.

Here’s a look at the types of damage that can happens to your car and house, and how an insurance policy can help cover these. Let’s start with car insurance first.

Damage to your car

There are typically two kinds of damage that floods can cause to your car. “The car interiors and upholstery could get completely soaked and need to be dried or replaced. The other, and more serious, damage can be to the engine. This happens when people try to crank up the car even when the car is flooded,"" said Amitabh Jain, head, motor underwriting and claims, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd.

“If the vehicle is flooded and you continue to drive or crank the engine, the water gets sucked into the engine. The danger of that happening is higher in bigger cars as engines are more powerful. Once water enters the engine, it could either partially or completely damage the engine,"" added Jain.

In fact, in a survey conducted by the insurer in July this year with 1,000 respondents from Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata, about 72% of the respondents admitted to have driven through water logged areas and 34% of them encountered a situation where their car stalled while driving through low-lying areas. Also, only 26% respondents were aware of the fact that a vehicle’s engine could cease while driving through water.

“Repairing the car’s engine can be very expensive. For example, repairing partial damage to an engine of a sedan could cost 50,000-1 lakh, while complete replacement could cost 2-3 lakh. Repairs in small cars could cost 25,000-50,000, and full replacement up to a lakh,"" said Jain. “This is why we recommend that if water levels reach the middle of the wheel, one must not drive or try cranking the engine,"" he added.

What’s worse is that this damage will not be covered by your car insurance policy. Other that third-party cover, which compensates a third party for damages caused by your vehicle and is mandatory for all plying vehicles, a comprehensive car insurance policy also consists of own damage (OD) cover.

OD insures your vehicle against theft or damage. Catastrophes such as floods are covered by your car insurance policy, but any consequential loss is not.

“Insurance covers unforeseen events like damages due to accidents or natural catastrophes. But during floods, if you start the engine and the engine gets damaged, the insurance policy will not cover it. That’s because this is not an unforeseen event, but a consequence of you trying to start the engine,"" added Jain. “Instead, if you call the insurance company, it will have the car towed to a workshop and have the engine flushed out and dried. The insurance policy will cover that cost. Also, if any upholstery needs to be repaired or replaced, the insurance policy will cover it,"" he added.

The good news is that there are add-on covers that will insure the engine even against a consequential loss. “In order to insure the engine for consequential losses, most insurers offer an add-on cover. Some call it ‘engine protect’ while some ‘engine secure’. The add-on cover will pay for repairs or replacement of the engine. One should also consider add-on covers such as zero depreciation cover and road safety assistance cover to be adequately insured,"" said M. Ravichandran, president, insurance, Tata AIG General Insurance Co. Ltd.

Damage to your house

Floods could also cause considerable damage to your house. “Flooding and inundation damages the structure of the house, such as its foundation and walls; it can cause the plaster and paint of the house to come off. Further, it could also damage furniture, clothes and electrical appliances. All of these damages are covered by a home insurance policy,"" said Sasikumar Adidamu, chief technical officer, non-motor insurance, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd.

However, many people are unable to make use of the benefits of a home insurance policy owing to poor penetration of the product.

“Due to low insurance penetration, majority of property losses are uninsured. A recent report by Ficci (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry) reflected a similar trend across various floods in the past like those in Mumbai, Surat and Uttarakhand where only 11% of the total losses were covered by insurers. During the Mumbai floods of 2005, total loss of 17,000 crore was reported, of which 4,000 crore was paid by insurers. In case of Surat floods in 2006, the total loss was 27,000 crore, of which only 3,000 crore was paid,"" added Adidamu.

To insure your house you can choose from two types of policies: the basic fire insurance policy and a comprehensive policy, also called the householder’s package policy (HPP).

The fire insurance policy covers your house and its contents against fire and other allied perils, which include storm and flood. Some insurers may ask you to pay an extra premium to cover other natural disasters such as earthquake.

HPP, on the other hand, packs in more covers apart from fire insurance. It includes covers that insure contents of your house against burglary and mechanical or electrical breakdown. Other covers include public liability cover (compensates a third party for losses caused by you) and personal accident (offers insurance on account of accidental death or total permanent and partial disability due to an accident).

“Just like car insurance, a standard fire insurance policy will not cover any consequential losses. So, if your electrical appliances get damaged due to voltage surge caused by lightening, the fire insurance policy will not cover it, because that is a consequential loss. But a householder’s policy, which includes electrical and mechanical breakdown insurance, will cover even damages due to voltage surge caused by lightening or otherwise,"" said Ravichandran.

Another factor that you need to keep in mind while buying a policy is the basis on which you arrive at the sum insured. “The sum insured can be declared on market value basis or on reinstatement basis. Insurance bought on market value-basis insures assets but will pay for claims after factoring in depreciation. It’s better to insure your house and its contents on a reinstatement basis as this will pay out the claim without any depreciation,"" said Ravichandran. Of the two types of policies, the one on reinstatement basis is likely to cost more.

In terms of cost, one must also be mindful of the risk of being under-insured. “At the time of making a claim, the insurer will send a surveyor, who will value the insured assets. If the value exceeds the sum insured, the insurer will consider it under-insurance. This means the insurer will reduce the claim amount in proportion to the level of under-insurance,"" said Ravichandran.

At the time of issuing an insurance policy, the insurer typically does not value your assets; it relies on the information that you provide. But at the time of assessing a claim, it will value the assets.

“At the time of buying home insurance, individuals should make a list of all the items and value these so that they can properly arrive at the sum insured figure that needs to be declared under the insurance policy,"" said Ravichandran.

It’s important to understand your insurance policy well so that you don’t face a shock later. Following precautionary measures will help you protect against financial losses. At the least, if your car is flooded, don’t try to start it.

399,399,mumbai,2015,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-change-asia-coastal-cities-mumbai-dhaka-sea-level-flooding-storms/,10 Dec 2015,Asian powerhouses ignoring climate change risks?,"NEW DELHI -- The future will be a watery one for some of the world's biggest cities.

Predicted sea level increases this century mean many face increased flooding, stronger storm surges and unpredictable weather. How well coastal cities can cope will dramatically affect quality of life and their economic destiny. Many of the biggest are in Asia, powering economies while housing hundreds of millions of poor in sprawling slums.

Scientists generally agree seas will rise an average of 1 meter (3 feet) this century, though some predict an eventual increase as high as 6 meters on average. How quickly these changes occur will partly depend on whether negotiators at this week's U.N. climate talks in Paris can broker a strong treaty to limit the release of climate-warming greenhouse gases.

But with a certain amount of sea rise considered inevitable as warmer temperatures melt glaciers and expand oceans, cities will have to adapt quickly to spare investors losses and citizens from disaster. Those unprepared risk being highlighted as poor places to invest.

""It's difficult for businesses and societies to grasp what's happening,"" said Richard Hewston, a climate change analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, which advises companies on business risks. But some governments now realize ""they need to pay attention to these climate risk factors to attract investment.""

Global losses from flooding in coastal cities are already averaging about $6 billion a year, according to a 2013 study published in the journal Nature. Those losses could rise to $52 billion annually by 2050, it said.

Asia is particularly vulnerable because many of its countries are still struggling to lift hundreds of millions up from poverty, while its cities attract droves of migrants seeking better economic opportunities. Within a decade the world is expected to have 37 megacities with populations over 10 million, and 21 of them will be in Asia.

The Bangladesh capital, Dhaka, holds sprawling slums to which millions fled when rising seas swallowed their coastal homes. India's finance capital Mumbai has an annual gross domestic product of about $151 billion, along with some 2.8 million people crammed into low-lying slums that flood regularly.

""There are many children, too, who live in these homes,"" said Birender Bacchar Singh, who lives in Mumbai's Dharavi slum. ""Sometimes when huge waves reach the houses and crash, the shacks collapse and all our belongings get washed away. Yet we have no option but to live here.""

But the economic contribution of these cities is crucial. Highly vulnerable Dhaka alone makes up more than half of Bangladesh's GDP of $150 billion. Frequently flooded Manila accounts for two-third of the Philippines' economy, while Shanghai's $594 billion GDP or Hong Kong's $416 billion are bigger than the economies of many nations.

In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a vision of 100 smart cities popping up across the country, integrating high-tech systems for transportation, communication and sewage treatment. His urban development minister said last week in Paris that the plan would ""ensure sustainable development and economic growth.""

But little has been said about upgrading existing cities, where some 400 million Indians still cope with shoddy infrastructure, makeshift housing, trash-clogged drainage systems and inadequate sewage treatment.

""In terms of sea level rise, we really are at a very critical juncture. But we continue to build housing and infrastructure along the coast. Society does not seem to be cognizant of the risks,"" said Rishi Aggarwal, an environmental activist and fellow with the Observer Research Foundation in Mumbai.

Chennai is still drying out from monsoon floodwaters that subsumed the southern Indian city last week, largely due to chaotic urban planning that compromised its storm drains. The city's international airport, which sits on a dry river bed, was forced to close for days. Ten years earlier, the same thing happened in Mumbai, where both the old and new airports are also built over flood plains.

""If something like the 2005 floods in Mumbai could not wake up the city, it's hard to imagine what it will take,"" Aggarwal said.

If the Paris climate talks cannot steer the world from its current path toward a 4 degree Celsius rise in temperatures, sea rise will subsume coastlines that are now home to 470 million to 760 million people, according to a November study by the nonprofit research and news organization Climate Central.

Asia has seven of the 10 megacities with the highest number of people at risk of being displaced, the report says: Shanghai, Hong Kong, Kolkata and Mumbai, Dhaka, Indonesia's Jakarta and Vietnam's Hanoi.

Businesses worried about risks to production and profits are pushing hard in Paris for strong action. Banks have pledged green energy funds. Companies are promising to go carbon neutral.

""The interests of governments, the private sector and cities are aligning as never before,"" U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres said Sunday in Paris. ""We are witnessing the turning point in the way the global economy prices pollution and invests in real wealth.""

The stakes are high. In Southeast Asia alone, the Asian Development Bank expects climate change to cause losses that will reduce the region's potential GDP by 11 percent in this century.

But there's a flip side to the gloomy projections. Countries and businesses that are preparing for climate change could reap considerable financial benefits.

""When there's an improvement, it enhances the competitive of those cities,"" said Tatiana Gallego-Lizon, director of the bank's division on urban development and water.

She cited sewage improvements in Kolkata and drainage systems in Hanoi as helping those cities appeal to investors. ""If you plan it and market it properly, it could provide a very special boost for the economy.""

Shanghai, where the annual rainfall is about 20 percent higher than the global average, is already faced with occasional severe flooding. But while it has one of the highest populations at risk of climate-induced displacement, it also scores well on some lists ranking its capability to cope.

The city has constructed more than 520 kilometers (320 miles) of protective sea walls virtually encircling half the city to protect from typhoons and also to guard against rises in sea level over the coming century. The system of concrete walls and ramparts around the city is bolstered by a mechanical gate that rises and falls to regulate the amount of water that Suzhou Creek feeds into the Huangpu River which runs through the city.

""The controls we have in place already should be able to deal with the next 20, 50, even 100 years of rising sea levels,"" said Zhang Zhenyu, spokesman for Shanghai's flood control headquarters.

Standard & Poor's Ratings Services has estimated that climate change, and specifically increased flooding and stronger storm surges, will lead to an average decline of 1.2 notches in sovereign credit ratings, based on direct damage data projections from global insurance giant Swiss Re.

Developed nations have relatively low risk, due to ""their higher level of preparedness,"" S&P's Marko Mrsnik and Swiss Re's David Niklaus Bresch wrote in a Dec. 3 blog for the International Chambers of Commerce. But ""in terms of income, emerging and low income sovereigns seem the most vulnerable.""",issue,Chennai Floods,"Chennai, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai,1000 mm,$1 billion,300,10 million people affected,"The floods were caused by heavy rainfall from the northeast monsoon.

The heaviest rainfall recorded in a century wreaked havoc in Chennai, where the city’s natural drainage system has been impaired by unrestrained construction along river banks and wetlands.

Experts said problems of poor urban planning and rampant development are not unique to Chennai, and are a warning to other cities.

On December 1, Chennai recorded 345 millimeters (13.5 inches) of rain in a 24-hour period.

Prasanth Elango, 22, was fast asleep when water gushed into his ground-floor apartment. ""It was full of rubbish and sewage, and three to four dead bodies also came in my friend’s area. ... The water was coming from all the streets,” he said.

Lakes, wetlands filled

With such rainfall, experts said they are not surprised that India’s fourth-largest city turned into a series of islands.

Over the past 15 years, dozens of wetlands and lakes have been filled to build malls, residential areas and business parks in Chennai, a thriving industrial hub and information technology center that is home to more than 6 million people.

Nityanand Jayaraman, a Chennai-based social activist and writer, points out that one of the worst affected areas is Velachery, a thriving residential area that mushroomed on what was once a large lake area after the city’s technology industry boom.

“Between 2005 and 2015, this place has a mass rapid transit system, a railway station that has been constructed upon the marshland,"" Jayaraman said. ""There has been a vast profusion of buildings that have sprouted up over there to accommodate software workers in gated communities, and now we find that most of these things are under water, and most of the software workers have gone back home.""

He said the area did not suffer the same fate during heavy rains in 2005 because it was not as thickly populated.

Chennai is not the only city brought to its knees by a heavy deluge.

Ten years ago, the financial hub of Mumbai faced a similar catastrophe after being lashed by 944 millimeters (37 inches) of rain. Last year, Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir in the Himalayan mountains, found itself under meters (feet) of water after being deluged by heavy rains.

Unregulated construction

In both cases, urban planners pointed at silting, unregulated construction, and encroachments along lakes and water bodies, which pushed the water into city neighborhoods.

City planners warn that much of the urbanization of India is happening on areas not suitable for construction, such as in flood plains.

Kapil Gupta of the Indian Institute of Technology Mumbai convened India’s first panel on urban flooding, which was set up in the wake of the Mumbai floods.

“There has been unplanned construction and the drainage of these areas has not been planned. Our urban centers need to be protected. We are spending so much on infrastructure, but we need to spend on drainage also and, obviously, we need to leave sufficient path for the rainfall so that our activities are not paralyzed,” Gupta said.

Urban planners are ringing alarm bells as climate experts warn that global warming is likely to result in more extreme weather.

India’s mega cities are already home to millions of people. By 2050, 1 billion people are expected to live in urban areas.

This high-density population would put millions at risk when cities are devastated by flooding.

The Chennai floods have taken a heavy toll -- more than 280 people have died since November and industries have pegged losses at over $20 billion.

Drainage issue

Despite those figures, Shashidhar Reddy, former vice chairman of India’s National Disaster Management Authority, said stormwater drainage remains a low priority for city officials.

""Unlike the roads, which are getting widened to accommodate more traffic, the capacities of the drains have diminished because of encroachments, because of silting, and that is true to every city in India,"" Reddy said.

He said, on average, the capacity of stormwater drains need to be more than doubled.

After facing colossal losses, Chennai residents are taking action.

More than 50,000 have signed an online petition that calls for the mayor to take up flood relief work and ensure that the city’s drainage problems are addressed.",issue,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, India",November 2015,December 2015,Chennai,345 mm (13.5 in),$20 billion,280,"Millions of people displaced, loss of infrastructure and livelihoods","The floods were caused by heavy rainfall, which was exacerbated by the city's poor drainage system.

Flood is a difficult natural disaster to manage and model as India as a country has a topography that is constantly changing,"" said Tapan Singhel, MD & CEO, Bajaj Allianz.

Insurance companies have data compliers who have models on natural catastrophes like earthquakes. Bajaj Allianz has built models on earthquake as it also has historical data to fall on but for flood the company has started to create model only on the 26/7 Mumbai floods.

Bajaj Allianz was one of the insurance companies that had high exposure to claims from the J&K flooding. The company settled 28,000 claims and disbursed Rs 1,000 crore in a period of three-three-and-a-half months. Bajaj Allianz has a 23-24% market share in J&K.

In early September of 2014, monsoon rains in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir in India and the neighbouring region in Pakistan resulted in the worst flooding in 60 years. At least 665 perished and over 200,000 houses were destroyed. Together, the total losses in India and Pakistan were $5.9 billion (Rs 36,698 crore), and insured losses were at least $0.2 billion (Rs 1,244 crore). The total losses from the destruction of housing in India were at $4.4 billion (Rs 27,368 crore).

Cyclone HudHud caused the largest loss from a tropical cyclone, said the study. The total losses were estimated at $7 billion (Rs 43,540 crore), the largest of all natural catastrophes in the world in 2014. However, the insured losses were a fraction of the total at just $0.6 billion (Rs 3,732 crore).

Despite an increase in natural calamities the number of people buying home insurance or insurance for natural disaster has not increased. ""Such natural disasters create interest for just a few weeks and then its business as usual. In India less than one per cent of home buyers buy insurance coverage. Those who have been buying are doing so because of the home loan they have and that mandates an insurance plan,"" said Singhel.

India ranks among the top 10 countries when it comes to natural disaster risks according to Bajaj Allianz. And with natural disasters like the Jammu & Kashmir floods, Uttarakhand landslides, cyclone HudHud becoming more frequent, the firm believe that India's ranking in flood risk may increase further.",flood,2014 Jammu and Kashmir floods,"Jammu and Kashmir, India","September 3, 2014","September 20, 2014","Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan",100-150 mm,"$5.9 billion (Rs 36,698 crore)",665,"200,000 houses destroyed","The total losses from the destruction of housing in India were at $4.4 billion (Rs 27,368 crore).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Chennai is perhaps experiencing the worst impact of freak weather, but the city could have fared better had it protected and preserved its natural water bodies and drainage channels, experts at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said on Thursday.

The unprecedented deluge that Chennai has been subjected to is a reminder of increasing frequency of such freak weather events across the Indian sub-continent, they said.

Speaking on the subject, CSE director-general Sunita Narain said: “We have repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that our urban sprawls such as Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Srinagar etc. have not paid adequate attention to the natural water bodies that exist in them. In Chennai, each of its lakes has a natural flood discharge channel which drains the spillover. But we have built over many of these water bodies, blocking the smooth flow of water. We have forgotten the art of drainage. We only see land for buildings, not for water.”

Waterbodies

CSE’s research shows that Chennai had more than 600 waterbodies in the 1980s, but a master plan published in 2008 said that only a fraction of the lakes could be found in a healthy condition. According to records of the State’s Water Resources Department, the area of 19 major lakes has shrunk from a total of 1,130 hectares (ha) in the 1980s to around 645 ha in the early 2000s, reducing their storage capacity. The drains that carry surplus water from tanks to other wetlands have also been encroached upon.

Stormwater drains The analysis also shows that the stormwater drains constructed to drain flood waters are clogged and require immediate desiltation. Chennai has only 855 km of stormwater drains against 2,847 km of urban roads. Thus, even a marginally heavy rainfall causes havoc in the city.

A number of cities including Chennai are both water-scarce as well as prone to flooding. Both problems are related — excessive construction leads to poor recharge of groundwater aquifers and blocking of natural drainage systems.

Sushmita Sengupta, deputy programme manager with CSE’s water team, said: “While Chennai has been struggling to meet its water needs and has been even desalinating seawater at a huge expense, it allowed its aquifers to get depleted.”

Chennai’s human-made drainage is no replacement for its natural drainage systems — a CSE analysis shows that there are natural canals and drains that directly connect the city with wetlands, waterbodies and rivers such as the Cooum and the Adyar that run through Chennai. The Cooum is supposed to collect surplus water from 75 tanks in its catchment area within the Chennai Metropolitan Area, while the Adyar is supposed to carry the surplus water of about 450 tanks in its catchment area and also from the Chembarambakkam tank (which is not in its catchment).

The rains in Chennai have broken a 100-year record (374 mm in just 24 hours). In November, the city had received 1,218 mm of rain, which was almost three times more than the average the city receives (407 mm).

A 2006 study by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune had said that extreme precipitation events were increasing in frequency and intensity in India during the period from 1950 to the 2000s.

CSE’s climate change experts say that while detailed attribution studies needed to be done to find out more links between the Chennai catastrophe and climate change, existing scientific studies do establish the possibility of a connection.",issue,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city and suburbs,"1,218 mm",USD 1.5 billion,464,10 million people affected,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage, and encroachment on water bodies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The cataclysmic earthquake in Nepal has opened up another can of worms with respect to the much-maligned Development Plan of the BMC, one that would have put the lives of Mumbaikars at risk.

Completely ignoring the fact that Mumbai lies in a Seismic Zone III area and had felt tremors during the Bhuj earthquake in 2001 and the Latur disaster in 1993, activists and political parties say that the Development Plan had mentioned floods as the sole natural disaster that could prove to be a setback for the city, and that too only monsoon floods.



When earthquakes occur, people are supposed to evacuate buildings and head to open spaces. Activists say they wonder where people will find such open spaces in Mumbai. File pic

This glaring lapse, coupled with the fact that the DP had allowed for higher FSI and thus taller buildings and did not have provision for enough open space, would have meant that Mumbaikars would have been at grave risk had an earthquake struck the city.

Activists are now demanding that in the revised DP, which the BMC has been given four months to prepare, the civic body should factor in earthquakes, cyclones, tsunamis, and demarcate coastal zones to be prepared from floods from the sea.

Debi Goenka, executive director of Conservation Action Trust, who had written to the BMC about the issue even before the Nepal earthquake struck, said that when temblors occur, people are supposed to evacuate their houses and go to open spaces.

“But in Mumbai, there are very few open spaces. Where will the people go? The DP had also made provisions for higher FSI, which would have meant more taller buildings and thus, more damage spread over a wider area in the event of a collapse. The DP should have factored in all these things.”

“Adding to these problems are the new buildings with glass facades. The Fire Brigade already has problems firefighting in these buildings and in the event of a collapse, the glass will fly in all directions like shrapnel from a bomb. These are the things that the planners don’t seem to have thought of,” he said.

“The city felt tremors during the Bhuj earthquake as well and it was decided that since Mumbai is in a Seismic Zone III area, buildings should be designed to withstand earthquakes that would strike a Zone IV area. We just don't know whether this is being done,” he said.

Environmentalist Rishi Aggarwal said expecting too much from the BMC would be pointless, because the civic body exhibits apathy towards the people’s needs and woes. “Even if you have a flawless DP, the ethos of the BMC will remain the same.

Nepal earthquake: The aftermath in pictures

When the BMC does not bother to address basic issues like footpaths, expecting them to be sensitive towards these issues is a big thing. As a society, we have a lax attitude towards human life and that shows in the way we are governed.”

“The DP is supposed to factor in natural disasters. It deals with land use and the planning should be such that the city should be able to withstand disasters and keep its residents safe. It will be very shameful if we don’t act even after the Nepal earthquake.

Skymet Weather Team

Updated on July 21, 2015, 11:56 AM: Heavy downpour overnight in Mumbai has affected the passengers travelling via local trains. Many trains were cancelled due to heavy Monsoon rains. Besides roads, stations were seen waterlogged as well. However, due to heavy rains pleasant weather conditions have also returned to the city ushering in relief for Mumbaikars from warm and humid weather. See more here.

Updated on June 24, 2015, 8:40 AM: The deep depression in the Arabian Sea has crossed the Gujarat coast, but it will still keep the off-shore trough running from Gujarat up to Kerala coast active. As said earlier, the off-shore trough will help in giving good amounts of rain in south Gujarat, Konkan and Goa and Mumbai. In a span of 24 hours, from 5:30 am on Tuesday, Mumbai has received 142 mm of rain. And since the Arabian Sea weather system is still in the proximity, rainfall will continue to be heavy in Mumbai for next 24 hours. Thereafter moderate intensity rain will continue for 48 hours.

Updated on June 23, 2015, 16:16 PM: After crossing the 1000 mm mark, Monsoon rains in Mumbai seem to be heading towards another record. The unrelenting heavy rains have been bringing life to a halt. As several places remain waterlogged in Mumbai, life has been on a standstill sine morning. According to Skymet Meteorology Division in India, heavy rain is likely to continue for another 2 days.

Updated on June 22, 2015, 9:10 AM: In the last two days, the intensity of rain in Mumbai has decreased. The city in a span of 24 hours from 8.30 am on Sunday has received 93 mm of rain, which is far less than 283 mm of rain recorded on June 19. According to Skymet Meteorology Division in India, rainfall in Mumbai will continue with reduced intensity for next 48 hours, picking up thereafter. The low pressure area in the Arabian Sea, which is showing signs of strengthening further is expected to increase rainfall activity in the city again.

Updated on June 21, 2015, 12:45 PM: Moderate to heavy rains will continue to lash Mumbai, giving no relief from the inclement weather conditions. However, intensity of rain will not be as vigorous as it was previously. According to Skymet Meteorology Division in India, the cyclonic circulation over north-east Arabian Sea is still giving the weather. But as the system moves westwards, it will lead to the reduction in the Monsoon surge due to which rain will reduce further. We can expect relief only after two to three days.

Updated on June 20, 2015, 12:41 PM: After a gap of 2 hours, intermittent rain starts in Mumbai again. Some areas might receive good showers in the next 2 to 3 hours.

Updated on June 20, 2015, 10:30 AM: Rain has stopped for now, and water has receded from the roads. Train services restored.

Updated on June 20, 2015, 8:50 AM: The cyclonic circulation in the Arabian Sea continues to create favourable conditions for rain to continue in Mumbai for the next 24 hours. However, marginal relief is expected as the intensity of rain is likely to decrease and become sporadic on Saturday. In a span of 20 hours, from 8.30 am on Friday, Mumbai has received 175 mm of rain. A lot of areas in the city are still waterlogged. Parel and Gandhi market are among the worst hit areas. There is high tide expected again in Mumbai today, at around 3:10 pm. The wave height is likely to be 4.3 metres. Small tributaries and drains usually flow into the sea. When a high tide this strong hits an area, the flow of these tributaries and rivers are blocked. This results in stagnation of water which further causes a flood like situation and adds to the woes of the people. Meanwhile, the Western Railways has resumed services on all four lines as water levels have receded at some places.

Updated on June 19, 2015 14:00: As reiterated by Skymet, heavy rains have lashed Mumbai, bringing normal life in the city to a standstill. In a span of 24 hours from 8.30 am on Thursday, Mumbai has received a whopping 283 mm of rain, which pushes the total rainfall received so far in the month of June to 537 mm. This is more than the monthly average of 523 mm. Due to the downpour, road and rail traffic has been severely affected since Thursday afternoon. Several low lying areas including Dadar, Hindmata and Elphinstone road have been inundated in flood waters. Heavy traffic jams have also been reported from several areas in the city due to waterlogging. Office goers are the worst affected as they have to meander through waterlogged roads and battle heavy traffic before reaching office. Railway tracks have also been flooded at several places forcing Mumbai local trains to operate till Andheri. Trains returning from Kalyan junction and beyond to CST have been cancelled. As a result of heavy rains, the Mumbai municipal commissioner has directed all schools to remain shut. Meanwhile, weathermen at Skymet have forecast of more heavy rains over the next 24 hours. High tide of 4.60 metres is also expected around 2 in the afternoon. The offshore trough running from south Gujarat coast up to Kerala is causing rain in the region.

Mumbai Rain Highlights: Waterlogging has also been reported from Kurla, Chembur, Tilak Nagar, Andheri, Parel, Lower Parel, Thane, Navi Mumbai and Dombivili BMC has pressed 120 suction pumps into service to drain out water from low lying areas Suburban services on all the three railway lines of Central railway (CR) and Western railway (WR) in Mumbai have been suspended Many flights have been delayed and some of them have been diverted The Bombay High Court has declared a holiday.

“Depending on the geographical location, each city has a different cause that makes it vulnerable to a Chennai-like situation. But there are a few common factors, such as neglect of water bodies and inappropriate development along estuaries,” says KT Ravindran, urban designer and dean emeritus, RICS School of Built Environment.

Disastrous drains

Things look bad even for planned cities like Corbusier’s Chandigarh, which had what was considered, until two decades ago, India’s best drainage. Now, the pavement area in the city has increased leading to an overloading of the drainage system. New Delhi’s drains too are definitely not capital.

“Delhi’s floodplains have been concretised and unchecked construction is happening on them,” said water activist, Manoj Misra. “The covered storm water drains in Defence Colony, AIIMS and Lajpat Nagar are an invitation to disaster because rain water cannot enter them.”

For a city located on the Sangam, Allahabad’s drainage is woefully inadequate. A significant number of its 210 deep open drains and 115 roadside drains have been encroached upon. Chief Town Planner PK Solanki believes the situation could turn dangerous if the city received more than average rainfall. Bhubaneswar too once had a good drainage system but is now experiencing problems. “Over the years, the natural streams became a casualty to rampant construction activities. Drains are supposed to carry rain water not sewerage,” says planner Piyush Kumar Rout. The settlements in low-lying areas of the city suffered waterlogging after heavy rain in 2012, 2013 (during Cyclone Phailin) and in 2014. In 2013, in several colonies, people had to be evacuated from their houses with the help of boats. Mayor Anant Jena, however, stresses that the city is fully equipped to deal with rain and that Bhubaneswar will soon have 40 pumping stations and five sewerage treatment plants.

Even a new city like Amravati, Andhra Pradesh’s future capital, seems doomed. AP CM Chandrababu Naidu, who dreams of making it a world class capital needs to be cautious as the city will come up on 30,000 acres of farm land interspersed with a stream and smaller water channels. “The Amaravati capital city project, as it is being planned now, will expose the new city to the risk of Chennai-like floods, as large stretches of the proposed urban agglomeration there contain paleo-channels. Any large scale construction activity over those stretches will cause devastating floods whenever cloudbursts occur,” says environmentalist and former finance secretary to the government of India, EAS Sarma.

A look at a few cities that are on the brink of a possible crisis and the problems they are grappling with.

Population pressure

Our burgeoning population and the resultant pressure on infrastructure could shoulder some of the blame. Chandigarh was planned for a population of 5 lakhs, but is now home to 11 lakh people. Allahabad, which had a population of 14.96 lakh as per the 2011 census, is expected to see the figure rise to 20.50 lakh by 2021. Jaipur too has grown in the last decade — the population rose 26.19 per cent between 2001 and 2011. It now stands at 6.62 million. Nowhere is population pressure as evident as in the national capital. From 400,000 in 1901, the population of Delhi increased to around 18,248,290 in 2015. According to the last census, Delhi has a population of 16,753,235. This figure is set to rise by 40 per cent by 2020. The waste generated and pressure on the existing drains will increase accordingly. KT Ravindran insists the problem is not really the increasing population. “There is a fundamental inadequacy in the way we look at urban planning,” he says.

No dodging disaster

Jaipur was flooded most recently in 2012. The civic authorities struggled to cope but eventually the army had to be called in. Even Bengaluru has had its nightmare moments. In 2005, rains caused massive flooding in many parts of the IT corridor. A study found that the disappearance of lakes was to blame. There were 51 lakes in the heart of the city in 1985; today there are only 17. A field survey by environmental scientists Anil Gupta and Sreeja Nair in 2007 found that 66 per cent of all remaining lakes were being pumped with sewage and 72 per cent had lost all their catchment area.

India’s crisis calender

Nature fights back

According to a report from Climate Central a US-based research organization, Kolkata along with Mumbai are among the top 10 megacities across the world that faces a serious threat due to rising sea levels owing to climate change. Kolkata has an elaborate underground sanitation network. “But there is a limit. There won’t be any waterlogging if it rains at the rate of less than 10 mm per hour. If the rain is more, there would be waterlogging,” said Tarak Singh member-mayor-in-council (drainage and sewerage) of Kolkata Municipal Corporation.

The civic body over the past few years has taken a series of steps including the construction of new pumping stations, increasing the number of portable pumps and dredging of canals to improve the system. The city’s bowl shape and the fact that its lock gates cannot be opened when the rising water level coincides with high tide causes waterlogging.

More worrying is the disappearance of the city’s green cover. Recent satellite pictures show it has dipped to less than five per cent. The East Kolkata Wetlands are considered as the city’s natural kidneys because they treat the city’s sewage naturally. It also acts as huge carbon sink. But this is being gradually filled up.

The greatest threat will come from the Sunderbans, which provides the first level of protection from cyclones that originate in the sea. The mangrove acts like a sponge. But with increasing salinity, rising sea levels and the illegal felling of mangroves, experts feel most of the Sunderbans would degrade into less dense open mangrove by 2050. Sushmita Sengupta, deputy programme manager, Centre for Science and Environment believes erratic rainfall and the loss of wetlands are the main reasons that put cities at risk. “The issue of climate change and erratic rainfall is a separate one. But cities that are at high-risk are the ones that have lost huge wetland areas. Whether you look at the 2005 Mumbai floods or the 2014 Srinagar floods or the most recent one in Chennai, these are cities traditionally known for their wetlands, but have lost them in recent years. There is a disconnect between urban planning and the hydro-geological cycle. We need stronger wetland protection laws. Planners tend to value the land and not the water that is there in the land,” she says.

For several long-time residents of Tiruchi, last week’s Chennai floods brought back vivid memories of the 1977 floods that ravaged the city. That calamity was next only to the 1924 deluge — considered the worst ever of the 20th century in the region.

The Cauvery River and the Coleroon, essentially a flood carrier, several minor rivers, jungle streams and the network of irrigation system make Tiruchi flood-prone, especially during the North East monsoon. Tiruchi has witnessed floods in 1924, 1952, 1954, 1965, 1977, 1979, 1983, 1999, 2000 and in 2005.

Tiruchi 1977 still haunts those who survived the fury. The Cauvery was in spate with heavy inflows from Karnataka when a strong cyclone crossed the Nagapattinam coast on November 12 sweeping in nothing but water, wind and havoc. Though it got weakened into a cyclonic storm that evening over interior parts of Tamil Nadu, it emerged in the Lakshadweep islands the following day as a deep depression, according to a record of the Indian Meteorological Department (http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/static/cyclone-history-bb.htm).

“The maximum wind (speed) recorded is about 120 kmph on the 12th morning in Thanjavur, Tiruchirapalli and Pudukottai districts. An estimated 560 people died and more than 10 lakh were rendered homeless. 23,000 heads of cattle perished. The total damage to private and public property is estimated to be Rs.155 crore,” says the record.

Most parts of Tiruchi city and scores of villages in the composite district were up to seven feet under water. In Tiruchi city, the water almost reached the Mainguard Gate, the gateway to Rockfort. “St. Joseph’s College, Holy Cross College and Seethalakshmi Ramaswami College were inundated. The famous library of St. Joseph’s College suffered extensive damage,” recalls a former vice-principal V. Rangarajan. “The library lost 21,000 volumes of books on November 13,” says a reference in the college website.

Mr. Rangarajan observes that the water level rose rapidly. There were three feet of water in his ground floor house off the Salai Road nearby in no time. Many residents spent two or three nights atop terraces, including this writer, then in school. The Army was called out and fishermen from coastal areas chipped in, rescuing people in coracles from the marooned areas. With radio being the only mode of communication then, rumours kept people on tenterhooks. A rumour that the Bhavanisagar Dam had burst saw hundreds of people running on the streets and many climbed the Rockfort with whatever personal belongings they could carry.

(Source: PTI)

FIVE YEARS after the 2005 Mumbai deluge, an expert panel of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) came up with the first ever detailed national guidelines on management of urban flooding. The document made a distinction between flooding and urban flooding, describing the latter as a separate phenomenon which needs to be dealt with by an urban flooding unit under the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD).

However, the dedicated unit is yet to be set up. This despite the fact that the Ministry of Home Affairs had in July 2012 issued orders designating the MoUD as the nodal ministry for urban flooding. An MoUD spokesperson confirmed that no such unit exists in the ministry.

Terming the Mumbai floods as an “eye-opener”, which showed that the cause of urban flooding is different and needs a separate strategy, the report stated: “The NDMA has for the first time decided to address urban flooding as a separate disaster, delinking it from floods.”

The NDMA panel held that unlike rural flooding, with urbanisation, natural catchments develop and the increase in impervious surfaces results in higher run-off of rainwater during heavy rainfall, which increases the flood-peaks from 1.8 to 8 times and flood-volumes by up to six times.

It noted that flooding in urban centres is made worse by inadequate stormwater drains and largescale encroachments along natural waterways, and stressed on the need for improved forecasting and urban planning strategies. For this, it held that a dedicated cell under the MoUD, headed by a joint secretary level officer, must coordinate all urban flood disaster management and mitigation efforts at the national level. This pattern is to be replicated at the state level where the nodal agency would be the state-level urban development department.

Shashidhar Reddy, former NDMA vice-chairman who headed the expert panel, said that since the MoUD has a major role to play in urban infrastructure, it can coordinate and integrate efforts to ameliorate the impact of floods. “The nodal ministry for flooding has always been the Ministry of Water Resources/ Central Water Commission which has focused solely on riverine flooding in rural areas. Despite the home ministry notification, the MoUD or state urban development departments are still not the nodal ministry in practice. For instance, in Chennai, it should have been at the forefront in flood management, which wasn’t the case,” said Reddy.

The report also stated that cities like Chennai and Pune have reported urban heat island effects, which results in localised rainfall of high intensity. This is caused by clouds induced due to higher temperatures in urban areas as compared to its surrounding regions owing to the lack of vegetation, moisture absorbing soils and increase in built surfaces. It cited international case studies by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) which had observed increased rainfall intensities over urban areas due to this phenomenon.

Reddy pointed out that flood management is not only about rescue and rehabilitation but also about prevention, preparedness and mitigation which can be coordinated by the MoUD alone. “In our report, we had recommended that due to the localised nature of heavy flooding, cities need to have rain gauges every 4 sq km to transmit data in real time. Had Chennai had these, Doppler radars, and an institutional mechanism for more immediate-term, localised forecasts, it would have had three to six hours lead time for warning people, evacuating them, diverting traffic and rushing rescue teams,” he said. He added that considering the fact that by 2050, a majority of the 1.6 billion project population will be in urban areas, the country can no longer ignore its fragile urban ecosystem that constantly disregards land use classification.",solution,2005 Mumbai floods,"Mumbai, India",26 July 2005,29 July 2005,Mumbai city and suburbs,944 mm,"Rs. 10,000 crore",944,"10 lakh people were evacuated, 3,000 houses were damaged, and 26,000 vehicles were destroyed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

If climate change is indeed the culprit, then the Chennai floods should come as a severe warning to authorities since there could be many more such episodes in the near future across the country. And the only way to minimise the deleterious impacts of such wayward climate changes would be to make Indian cities climate resilient.

But to just blame climate change-induced heavy rain alone for the chaos in Chennai would be wrong. Like Kashmir (2014) and Uttarakhand (2013), Chennai was also as much a man-made disaster as it was a climate disaster.

In its rush to develop, the government and urban planners have completely destroyed its vast network of water bodies that would soak in extra water in case of heavy rainfall and the natural drainage system. The city’s largest mall, Phoenix, is on a lake-bed — Velachery. The Second Masterplan of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority also has scant regard for hydrology, claim experts.

By 2031, India’s urban population is projected to increase by more than 200 million to 600 million, or 40% of the national population.

Indian cities must build resilience so that they can withstand such natural shocks and become more appealing to do business and attract talent. But building resilience, as Judith Rodin, president of The Rockefeller Foundation, says, is not a sprint or even a marathon.

It’s a relay race. And that must begin in right earnest now to ensure that every disruption does not become a disaster.

For a straight 15 hours on Tuesday, torrential rains pounded Chennai, causing the Chembarambakkam lake to overflow its banks, and leading to a deluge of near-Biblical proportions, the likes of which, say old-timers, hasn’t been seen in the past 100 years.Between 8.30 a.m. and 11.30 p.m., the city recorded 236 mm rainfall, the heaviest rainfall since 2005 October in a single day. And yet, the rains show little sign of easing up.The volume of rain is clearly way more than the city can handle, and way more than what the city has endured over the past fortnight, say reports.Making things worse was the inability of residents to access rescue teams provide by the state government, Ola Cabs, NTL, and others.Travellers are stranded as Chennai Airport has cancelled all flights for Wednesday due to flooding on the runway; a number of hotels are also refusing to extend guests’ stay.A senior official of an automobile company who was visiting from Mumbai said that he was supposed to take a Mumbai flight Wednesday afternoon. Now, not only has his flight been cancelled, but the hotel is also refusing to extend his stay.There are power outages in many parts of the city; mobile phone connectivity in various parts has also been hit, making it harder to residents to reach out for help.Business Standard also tried calling the numbers given by various departments, as well as those provided Ola Cabs, NTL and others, but all of them were continuously busy, suggesting that they, too, have been overwhelmed, either by callers or by the waters.In effect, the city has ground to a halt – schools, colleges, IT companies, factories and other commercial establishments are shut.And unlike the clouds, which have hung over the city for close to a fortnight now, there’s seems to be little good news on the horizon – weather forecasts say the rains are likely to continue for the next 24 hours at the least.Krishnan, an IT professional staying at Jaffarkhanpet, close to West Mambalam, in the heart of the city, told Business Standard that the water level in his house has increased since 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, forcing him to move to the second floor from the ground floor. His car, too, has been washed away by the floodwaters, and his attempts to reach rescue team have been unsuccessful so far.A number of people, especially those working in the city’s IT hub, remain stranded at their offices as roads have virtually turned into waterways. Similarly, at Mahindra World City, people are staying at guest houses inside the office complex. Even those who working and living within city limits have not been able to return home.Jaishankar, who works at Annasalai and stays about 5-6 km away at T. Nagar, said he had to stay back in office as all the connecting bridges and subways are inundated. Thankfully, he told Business Standard, a colleague offered him a place in his house for the night.Not everyone is as lucky.

A senior official from the General Insurance Corporation, the sole domestic reinsurer, said that the company is still receiving estimates from insurers but cumulative losses are likely to be under ₹500 crore for the industry.

Most claims have come for automobiles and property and from small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Chennai-headquartered United India Insurance received the largest number of claims amounting to ₹130 crore, primarily for automobiles and from small-scale units.

G Srinivasan, Chairman and Managing Director of New India Assurance, said that the company has received claims amounting to ₹35 crore.

He said that the magnitude of lossfor general insurers may not be as big as that seen during Cyclone Hudhud which affected Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and the floods in Jammu and Kashmir as most claims have come from flooding in low-lying areas and there have been no major losses to industries, apart from small stock losses.

Last year, natural disasters such as the floods in Jammu and Kashmir and Cyclone Hudhud led to insured losses of around ₹1,500 crore and ₹4,000 crore, respectively.

Easwara Narayanan, Chief Operating Officer, Future Generali India Insurance, said that the company has received 45 claims till date with a total claim size of ₹8 crore mainly from affected areas like Chennai, Puducherry and Cuddalore.

Tata AIG General Insurance has received around 30 claims for motor and property so far.

“We don’t see a major trigger for large claims as it was not a cyclone and most of the claims will come from only flooding,” M Ravichandran, President - Insurance, TATA AIG General Insurance, said.

Bajaj Allianz General Insurance has received close to 240 claims primarily for high-end vehicles and property.

What happened in Chennai is a classic reminder that severe damage can be caused when we ignore our rivers and water bodies and forge ahead with unbalanced city development. Earlier, Mumbai and Kolkata also had provided similar warnings when flooding took place, upsetting normal city living. Neglect of the Mithi river in Mumbai, ignoring Tolly's Nullah in Kolkata and now not taking into account the key role of the Adayar, Cooum and Kosathalaiyar rivers traversing the city of Chennai along with the opportunistic exploitation of land along the Buckingham canal - interpreting it as public land - have all upset the character of balanced city living, raised questions about the fundamentals of urban planning and caused untold misery.Let us focus on Chennai. In addition to the rivers, and the Buckingham canal which intersects the Adayar and Cooum rivers within the city, the city had about 600 water bodies in the 1980s. The City Development Plan prepared in 2005 under the National Urban Renewal Mission referred to as many as 320 tanks and lakes within the city limits. One question that arises in the context of the damage caused by unprecedented rains this time is whether these water bodies have been properly listed, protected, maintained and allowed to play the role they are supposed to.This is the city where, when the state government proposed to build an industrial park near the Chembarambakkam lake - which originally was a water body for irrigation but is now a reservoir to supply drinking water to the city - people went to court, and subsequently the government had to commit that the land around the lake would remain agricultural. The city's elevated railway has come up along stretches of the Buckingham canal, raising questions as to whether this has blocked culverts and checked the natural flow of drainage. Chennai's new airport terminal was built on the floodplains of the Adyar; pictures of aircraft stranded in water provide proof of what happens when nature's path is tampered with.Further, if it is true that educational institutions, special economic zones and gated colonies have come up in good numbers in the catchment areas of the rivers and canals, one can imagine how much disruption of the natural drainage route would have resulted. Is there some way of finding out who is responsible for this callous violation of provisions when construction permissions were granted and completion certificates issued?There are more questions about ignoring what needs to be protected or preserved. Isn't it a fact that the Pallikaranai marshland in the city has become the largest dumping site for solid waste? Hasn't the master plan of 2008 warned that, considering its importance and the drainage system it provides, contiguous swamp area in Pallikaranai should remain conserved, prohibiting development therein?A CSE study carried out in the mid-1990s showed that most waterways in the city are choked with sludge and waste. It is also mentioned that government's own studies accept that waterways in Chennai convey treated and untreated sewage and garbage together. These waterways, which also function as the city's flood discharge channels, are encroached and built upon as well, affecting their flow. Huge amounts of untreated waste in the rivers lead to sludge formation, clogging the waterways. Will some details emerge as to what extent these factors have contributed to the misery seen in the city when unprecedented rains overtook the city?There are some interesting contradictions as well, as far as city management is concerned. Chennai is reported to have a very successful rain water harvesting programme. Rain water harvesting structures are mandatory in all buildings. People responded to this requirement positively; they understood the value of water, since the city faces severe water shortages. Rain water harvesting had its impact, as studies showed that the average groundwater level improved; the quality of water improved, with a drop in total dissolved solids; and a very large percentage of city households have this facility installed. This kept aquifers recharged, and so fewer private wells go dry during droughts. Chennai Metro water became eligible for carbon credits by generating sufficient electricity through biogas from sewage sludge. Why did the present damage happen in such a vibrant and alert city?Every city is supposed to have a well-prepared disaster management plan that is not only supposed to be updated regularly, but, before each season the district administration and the city system are expected to review preparedness to meet any type of extreme situation and alert all those concerned. Was this meticulously done? When water had to be released from the reservoir, was sufficient advance warning given and various possible eventualities assessed so that deaths could have been avoided, damage to property minimised and the food and sanitation requirements of those stranded adequately taken care of? What was the plan for the old, sick and the disabled? Did it work properly?It is an absolute must that citizens should be given full details on all of these, not only for accountability within the system, but also as a warning for the future.Did the master plan detail what needs to be done to ensure proper flow of water in situations like this, and how the flood plain should not be encroached upon? Does the city have a well-prepared drainage master plan, and where does it stand with regard to its implementation? If there have been lapses, should they not be revealed, and handled firmly? In the ""smart city"" vision and plan now prepared, how well has this issue been addressed, so that smartness means the city will not have to face such misery and agony again?",discussion,Chennai Floods 2015,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",12 November 2015,17 November 2015,Chennai city and suburbs,"1,044 mm","Rs. 10,000 crore",324,1.8 million people affected,"The floods were caused by unprecedented rains that caused the rivers Adayar, Cooum and Kosathalaiyar to overflow.

NATURE’S FURY OR THE GREED OF MAN?

Though such floods are often officially referred to as natural disaster, there is always an element of human negligence behind them. Many so called natural disasters in India have been a result of mindless exploitation of our environment. Such disasters are a reminder that we have to care for our environment much more than what we are doing now.

The death and destruction caused in Chennai by torrential rains would have been much lesser if the lakes were not encroached upon and rivers not mined indiscriminately for quarrying.

Until few years, all the rivers and lakes in Chennai were connected by channels. Unfortunately, all those connections have been destroyed. The sand mafia and land grabbers have taken the land in between the canals, tanks and water channels. Owing to scanty rainfall in the recent past, there was no water in those canals. People have built homes in these areas, most of them low-lying.

Because of such encroachments, there is no outlet for water to flow when one tank is full and the city gets easily flooded. The recent floods around Chennai are not a natural disaster, but a man-made tragedy created by unrestrained construction.

FLOODGATES OF MISMANAGEMENT

I was told that the officials concerned delayed in opening the floodgates despite the reservoirs reaching their full capacity. By the time they opened the gates it was too late.

This is attributed to a delay in obtaining permission from the higher authorities. Despite having technical knowledge about what to do in such situations, the officials were scared to act without an order. During such situations when superiors or seniors are not available, one must use his or her common sense and act. One must have the courage to take responsibility and be ready to face the consequences for the larger good.

VOLUNTEERS IN ACTION

On the brighter side, the disaster has brought out the goodness in people. It is touching to see people from all backgrounds set aside their differences and come together to help the victims. Nature has strange ways of uniting people.

I deeply appreciate the work of our volunteers who were helping the people stuck in the floods. The Art of Living volunteers supplied cooked food in almost all flood-affected areas of Chennai and distributed over 700 tons of relief material. Many volunteers went into the flooded areas to provide help braving above-waist water-levels.

Let us all come together and help the people of Chennai, in whatever way we can. It’s time to remember that man-made disasters are easily preventable and take remedial actions.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

On ordinary days, it is an anaemic rivulet contaminated with sewage that ekes its way to the estuary at the Bay of Bengal. The river cuts the city in half: Government and old Madras to the north, residential and tech Chennai to the south. The river bends a few times in the city—at Jafferkhanpet, Saidapet, Kotturpuram and Adyar—as it languorously makes its way to the sea. Near each of these locations is a major road bridge across the river.

Following weeks of steady rain in November and a deluge on 1 December, the Adyar flooded its banks and inundated its floodplain, bringing misery upon an entire city. The problem was compounded—some say caused—by the release of water from the Chembarambakkam (earlier called Puliyur) dam, about 40km upstream.

The reservoir was dangerously close to full capacity. The official estimate was that 30,000 cusecs were released from the dam into the Adyar during that fateful night, but unofficial estimates that include output from surrounding water bodies put that number at 100,000 cusecs.

In a tragic misjudgment, a usually parched city set about conserving its drinking water when instead it should have steadily released it in the days leading up to the deluge.

The Chennai airport and its runways—west of the city—are built right beside the Adyar and on its floodplain. The second runway was extended five years ago by building a bridge over the river—the bridge simply ladled the water straight into the airport. The entire airport complex was flooded and remained so for several days. Jafferkhanpet, Defence Colony, Saidapet, Kotturpuram, Nandanam and parts of Adyar were flooded to first-floor levels.

So, the sequence of catastrophe and failure goes like this: El Niño and global warming probably led to the unprecedented rain; mismanagement of the reservoir and haphazard urban planning and misuse of land through illegal construction exacerbated the problem; and the lack of early warning and preparedness sealed the city’s misery.

The armed forces—the army and navy in particular—and 50 teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) did a good job of mitigating the impact by rescuing stranded citizens and distributing essentials. The navy pressed its amphibious warship INS Airavat into service with supplies and used drones to locate the worst-hit areas. Chennai’s denizens supported each other through the crisis and the city is now slowly returning to normal.

So what are the lessons for India’s cities?

As one tweet had it, “before India sets about creating smart new cities, it should make its existing cities less dumb"". This profound observation has many facets.

The first is to assess which cities are prone to floods and in what manner. Coastal cities with rivers that also get heavy rainfall—Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai—are more prone to floods than non-coastal cities without rivers (Bengaluru for instance).

The cities of North India on the path of the great rivers—Yamuna and Ganga—such as Delhi, Allahabad and Patna are at risk. Garbage and silted storm water drains are a threat everywhere. Land subsidence—a gradual sinking of land often caused by ground water exploitation—results in a saucer-like capacity to draw floodwater.

Technology and data must form the basis to decide what measures of flood resilience are best suited for the city in question. Laser altimeter terrain mapping and high-resolution satellite imagery are required for the accurate measurement of low- and high-level areas in a city localized to neighbourhoods and streets. Images to determine palaeochannels (historical but not visible former paths of a river) can help define which parts of the river and its floodplain should be left alone.

Ironically, all of this was talked about in Chennai, but none of it practised.

In general, Europe has more useful lessons for riverine flood management than the US. The Netherlands has implemented an innovative new programme called Room for the River that mitigates flooding risks.

Bunds or dykes are located further inland allowing a broader floodplain, the perennial channel of the river is dredged to make it deeper, an explicit high-water channel is sometimes created and the reservoir is dredged to allow greater capacity. The need for better reservoir management is one crucial lesson from Chennai’s disaster.

Not only existing cities, but also two high-profile new ones are going to be built on or near riverbeds. Panvel, in New Mumbai, will house the new airport and will be surrounded by the Panvel Creek and the Kalundre River. The capital of Andhra Pradesh, named Amaravati, will come up on the southern banks of the River Krishna, in the vicinity of a village called Uddandarayunipalem.

The lessons from Chennai will need to be considered seriously in designing these cities.

P.S.: Sung in a different context, pop-singer Adele’s song Water Under the Bridge from Album 25 reflects Chennai’s plight:

If you are not the one for me

Then I’ll come back

And bring you to your knees!

Soni said the victim boy, Sandeep, was caught in the basement of his house flooded with rainwater in Radhakishanpura area. A rescue team evacuated him after breaking the door and rushed him to a hospital, but he died on the way, the collector said.

Sikar recorded 10 cm of rains between 5 am on Wednesday and 5 pm on Thursday, and many low-lying areas in the city were facing a flood- like situation. Rescue operations were on to shift people to safer places. It rained heavily at Data Ramgarh in Sikar district, but the situation is under control, Soni said.

The meteorological department has forecast rain/thunderstorm at a few places in east Rajasthan and at isolated places in west Rajasthan. The department said many places in the state, including Neem ka Thana in Sikar district (11cm), Sikar ( 10cm), Chechat ( Kota) (9cm), Bayana (Bharatpur) and Jodhpur’s Bilara (8cm each), had witnessed heavy rains over the last 24 hours.

Other districts like Tonk, Pali, Chittorgarh, Jhalawar, Bundi, Dholpur, Kota, Bhilwara, Rajsamand, Baran, Nagaur, Ajmer, Churu and Bikaner received rains in the range of 1cm-6cm.

Jaipur on Thursday recorded 20.3mm rains, and according to the Met forecast, rain/ thunderstorm would occur during the next 24 hours.

MUMBAI: Mumbai’s wettest June day since 2005 brought it to its knees on Friday, with the suburban train network getting crippled, roads getting water-logged, most office-goers not even venturing out of their homes, and the few who did getting fleeced by taxi and rickshaw-wallahs. Santacruz recorded 283.4mm of rainfall in the 24 hours from 8.30am on Thursday to 8.30am on Friday , higher than the 209.6mm on June 24, 2007, which had been the record for the month in the past decade.Colaba, on the other hand, got 208.8mm.The season’s required total rainfall for Colaba is 2,230mm, while for Santacruz it is 2,558mm, so over 10% of this was received by the city in a single day. From 8am to 5.30pm on Friday, Colaba recorded 74.4mm of rainfall and Santacruz 111.8mm.Mumbai will see heavy rain on Saturday as well, the met department said. The state education department has asked schools and colleges to remain shut on Saturday.Two persons – a 60-year-old man and his five-year-old grandson – were electrocuted in Sardar Nagar in Wadala early Friday morning as the claims of monsoon preparedness of the cash-rich BMC, which has a budget of Rs 33, 514.15 crore, were washed away, with water-logging reported across the city.In a major embarrassment to the civic body, the Cleveland pumping station, built at a cost of Rs 116 crore and inaugurated by Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday, developed a problem after a boulder got stuck in one of its gates. The pumping station was supposed to handle waterlogging at Worli, Koliwada, Dadar and Senapati Bapat Marg.The civic body had claimed to have completed 99.4% of desilting work till June 3, and the percentage of desilting work done at Mithi river was 99.3, officials had said. Rs 250 crore have been spent on desilting over 2 years. Yet the city saw flooding even in localized areas, and the water level in Mithi went up to 4.5 metres on Friday evening, creating panic among civic officials as it was just 0.2 metres below the danger mark.While the BMC’s disaster control room was full of activity, with 1,000 calls received till as early as 10am, the place also saw a stream of politicians coming in, from chief minister Devendra Fadnavis , who was the first to visit, to Shiv Sena’s Aditya Thackeray . CM Fadnavis assured that he would solve Mumbai’s water-logging issues in six months. Uddhav Thackeray had earlier said, as head of the ruling Sena in the BMC, that there would be no flooding this monsoon.However, Madhav Chitale, noted hydrologist who had submitted recommendations to ensure a flood-free city post the 2005 floods, was scathing in his criticism of the BMC. He said his report had made clear what kind of preparations were needed, and if the city could not handle rain, it was “a clear indication” the recommendations had not been implemented.The local train network disruption was the worst since the 26/7 deluge in 2005 as flooding prevented CR from running services on the CST-Thane and CST-Vashi stretch from morning till late evening and even WR services were suspended between Churchgate and Andheri from 10.30am to 4.20pm because of water-logging at Matunga Road and Elphinstone Road.WR’s divisional railway manager Shailendra Kumar said, “There was 200-250 mm of water on tracks as water could not recede via Dharavi nallah handled by the BMC administration.”While CR cancelled 8 long-distance trains and revised timings of 5, WR revised timings of four outstation trains. CR has decided to cancel three long-distance trains on Saturday.Major roads, among them Santacruz-Chembur Link Road, Peddar Road and SV Road, were clogged. Other areas badly hit were Nepean Sea Road, Matunga’s Gandhi market, Chembur’s Umarshi Bappa to Surana Hospital stretch, Sion, Bhoiwada-Hindmata, Parel TT, Byculla’s Palace Cinema, Dadar TT and Mahim’s SK Bole Road.Motorists reported snarls on the Bandra-Worli sea link, Worli Naka, and Malad Link Road and Andheri Link Road. Trees collapsed at five locations in the morning.BEST operated 212 special buses to cater to those stranded outside railway stations and on their way to office. But more than 50 buses were stuck in traffic snarls in the island city in the morning, and a few buses broke down.Fleecing and refusals by autos and taxis were rampant. Several cabbies overcharged passengers. One of them, at Vikhroli, demanded Rs 500 to travel just a 10 km distance, which would have cost not more than Rs 150. By Friday afternoon, more than 50% taxis and autos were off the roads.The BMC’s alert in the morning to schools asking them to stay shut for the day probably saved the day for many Mumbaikars who were alerted by the message and did not leave for their workplace.Arrivals and departures at Mumbai airport were delayed by an average of 45 minutes. Though there were no flight cancellations, three arrivals had to be diverted to Ahmedabad and Vadodara.The Bombay high court declared a holiday on Friday, and the Mumbai University pushed back all senior-college admission dates to Monday.Parts of the island city and suburbs faced power outage as at least a dozen sub-stations were shutdown temporarily as a “precautionary measure”Of the seven lakes that supply water to the city, only Vihar and Tulsi lakes, which are situated within city limits, recorded a rise in water levels. Other catchment areas did not benefit from the heavy rain.But not everything was bad for Mumbaikars: many of them took in the showers at Marine Drive and Worli seaface, while others welcomed the extended weekend and looked forward to a relaxed Saturday and Sunday.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

People like me, people who came of age in the eighties in middle-class urban India, grew up in a different India. We were something of an in-between generation. Our grandparents lived through the transition from colony to nation; our parents grew up in the years of nation building. We grew up taking independence and a certain degree of development for granted, without having all the gadgets, the conveniences, the consumer goods, and the general first world-ness that the young of today were born into.

We also grew up with messages of unity in diversity surrounding us. We were all one, despite our religious and cultural differences, advertisements and pre-movie short films (and when TVs came into our homes, Doordarshan) told us. ‘Ek, Anek’, as a particularly cute animated short put it.

Peter Griffin Peter Griffin

To stripling me, Bombay pretty much exemplified this. After living in Visakhapatnam, Secunderabad and Madras, none of them small towns by any means, I was now in a true metropolis. The neighbourhood where we lived, the kids in my school, the markets, the buses, the trains, most of all the trains: all of this city teemed with diversity; it was like living in a Films Division short.

I grew up, with more friends whose families had come here from various parts of India — one, two, maybe three generations ago — than those who could claim centuries of city-born ancestry. Quite natural in a city that did not really exist as a city before hunks of its hills were toppled into the gaps between islands to make new land. We celebrated each other’s holidays and high days with gusto, visiting each other, sending across sweets and savouries to each other to better share the joy.

When you visited relatives back in the ‘native place’ during the summer holidays — in this city of migrants, everyone seemed to be from somewhere else — your Bombayness was acknowledged with gentle proscriptions along the lines of ‘you can’t do X here; this is not Bombay.’

The way it was

Don’t get me wrong. It is not that the city was immune to communal and religious divides, that caste and class lines did not exist — it would be beyond childishly naive to suggest that — it was just that it felt like we were living in a country that was trying to rise beyond those schisms and, more important, in a great city that was leading the way in that effort, a city that had always been a pioneer in progressive thought. (Remember the Quit India movement? Remember where it was launched?) In Bombay, one could believe, the place you were born in, the god you bowed to, the language you spoke, the food you ate, none of these would stop you from making it as long as you were willing to work hard.

That changed in 1992. The demolition of the faraway Babri Masjid that December brought riots to Bombay. For those of us who lived here through those times, there was a chill in the air far colder than the city’s puny winters could ever bring. Men shaved off their beards lest they be mistaken for Muslims. Nominal Christians who weren’t the most regular of churchgoers made sure their crosses were visible. Nameplates that had names easily identified as being from the ‘wrong’ community were taken down, leaving behind clean rectangles on otherwise weathered walls and doors. The first mentions of vegetarian housing societies came up. People talked softer in trains and buses for a while. Those riots, the ones that followed in January 1993, and then the bomb blasts that March, they killed many innocents. And they also delivered a mortal wound to Bombay’s belief in its invulnerability from the small-mindedness lesser towns and cities were plagued by. When the Shiv Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party coalition that came to power in the next state elections renamed the city Mumbai, it was just a literal ending to the idea of Bombay; that city had already become something else.

Through flood and fire

(Melting pot: “Bombay was all about differences coming together and somehow working.” Picture shows a stretch at Dharavi. Photo: AP)

Mumbai is still a resilient city. As we sprang back from the riots of 1992 and 1993, so did we recover, quickly, from the cloudburst and floods of 2005. We survived the body blows of the multiple blasts that ripped apart local trains in 2006. We got through the full frontal terror attacks of 2008, the seventh sad anniversary of which we mark this week. Yes, even then, we stopped what we were doing and stayed home and watched our televisions, but we were soon back at work, a little quieter, a little more thoughtful, a lot more fearful, but what does one do, livings must be earned. Each time, we went back. We regained our swagger and our style.

Mumbai, like Bombay, has no time to spare, where distances are measured in minutes and hours, not kilometres. It is still a place that rewards hard work, where fortunes can be made from humble beginnings.

Mumbai is a more crowded city than Bombay ever was, but that was inevitable; gold-paved streets are magnetic, but an island only has so much space in which to grow. And this has meant that we pay ludicrous prices for the cubes of air we call our homes, that we spend precious hours just getting to and from our places of work, that our open spaces are threatened, that builders can buy politicians and bureaucrats will conspire. (For me, it’s meant that my family had to move out of the city, to its little sister across the creek. Once it was called New Bombay, then the municipal signboards welcoming you to the city were blackened with tar, and a new name was painted over it in rough letters: Navi Mumbai. That name become official too. Just history repeating itself in a different geography.)

Mumbai is still safer for women, for children, for the aged, than most other cities are. It is still a home to the arts and culture and sport and entertainment and all the fine things that are worth working hard for, the better to appreciate and enjoy them.

We live more comfortable lives, certainly, than most of India. We can take our electricity for granted most of the time. And though we panic about the water levels in our lakes, we somehow make it through each year until the monsoons arrive. Our air is far from clean, but the sea breeze bails us out most days, blowing away some of the smog.

And yes, we are richer. And yes, we have so much that more developed countries have, the big brands and the High Streets, the glass towers and the luxury cars. Heck, we may not be Shanghai yet, but we have our very own suspension bridge.

But in the Mumbai of today, it has become okay to talk of the Other.

Bigotry is now legitimate; it no longer speaks in whispers, it is loud, it shrieks on our streets, shuts down shops, and sometimes the whole city. It does not want you to live in its buildings, it does not want you to cook your way, dress your way.

In this unsentimental city, hurt sentiments take centre-stage more often these days. (And we, the media, cannot absolve ourselves from blame for providing a steady stream of the publicity to the publicity-seeking hurt sentiment that comes our way.)

Again, don’t get me wrong. Just as it was not a total free thinker’s paradise when my generation was growing up, it certainly is not hell in which we find ourselves in our middle age. Things are undoubtedly and demonstrably worse in other parts of India and, yes, the world.

We will survive

“ Mumbai, like Bombay, has no time to spare… It is still a place that rewards hard work, where fortunes can be made from humble beginnings. ”

Mumbai still is, and regularly proves itself to be, more progressive in its thinking than most places. In Mumbai, hard work still rules, and good ideas can still find a home. In Mumbai, you can still say what you believe, and be sure that no one will try to kill you if what you say offends them… reasonably sure, that is. I can still casually call the city Bombay, as an old friend can do, without more than the odd idiot on Twitter scolding me. Perhaps one day louts-for-hire may gherao this newspaper’s office if their paymaster’s delicate feelings are hurt by something we say, but this newspaper will still come out the next day, and its journalists will still walk the streets unafraid.

But here’s the thing. Today, liberal voices are more hushed; free speech advocates now censor themselves. This can only be a bad thing in a city founded on free movement: of people, of goods, of money, of ideas.

Bombay was all about differences coming together and somehow working. Bombay celebrated its differences, made the most of them and like some medieval alchemist, it conjured up success and growth. One couldn’t expect any less from a city that was imagined up out of seven islands and lots of swamp and sea.

But maybe that’s a lot of poetic tosh, born of too much brainwashing by the Films Division in one’s formative years.

Perhaps the Idea of Bombay began to die before the name did. And perhaps now, while it still gasps for breath, it’s really past hope and we should let that idea go. That would make me sad.

There’s a part of me, though, that doesn’t want to believe that: the part of me that still calls the city Bombay, as if using that name would conjure it back into existence. Who knows? Maybe there are enough of us, and if we all think about it really, really hard…

The government’s flood and crisis management effort is expected to be a key issue in the assembly election to be held before May 2016.

Jayalalithaa’s traditional rival the DMK is already using the people’s anger stemming from their impatience about the delay in normalcy returning and moulding it into a potent weapon along with attempts to bring in smaller parties on a single platform to take on the till-now seemingly invincible AIADMK supremo.

DMK treasurer and its most-likely chief ministerial pick MK Stalin had in a mass-contact programme ridiculed Jayalalithaa’s style of functioning and lambasted the unavailability of any AIADMK leader or government officer to solve the people’s problems.

“During the DMK rule, we were available, meeting people and addressing their problems,” Stalin had said. “But today, leave alone Jayalalithaa, you cannot even meet the district or taluka level AIADMK man or woman. And about officials, the less said the better.”

Stalin was not wrong, as there was a spate of angry protests in parts of Chennai over the alleged neglect of flood victims.

”None of the councilors or block leaders of AIADMK or any government official bothered to visit us and see our trouble,” said an irate S Ganesan, a resident of a government housing colony in Kotturpuram.

Political analyst Prof Ramu Manivannan concurs that people’s anger could be fresh in their memories in the run-up to the elections and any slip-ups in relief and rehabilitation could prove costly for Jayalalithaa, who otherwise has had a good run.

“Although Jayalalithaa cannot be held guilty for all that has happened now, people’s impatience can turn into anger,” said the Madras University Professor. “If Jayalalithaa manages to pull out all stops and does a good job, with the help of a friendly central government, then it would be a different story

I tend to get rather impatient with those who lament the loss of the ‘spirit of Mumbai’, or bemoan that something has changed in the city. Something always changes, everywhere and every time, darlings: c’est la vie. As for the city’s spirit, I think we too often mistakenly equate it with resilience (Mumbai recovers so fast after floods, terrorism, communal violence, and so on, because either it is “like this only” or because it has no choice) whereas what it should really be celebrating is its clever jugaadu nature.

Jugaad is often used to stand for the capability of producing cheap, inferior-quality alternatives. But I prefer to think of the word in terms of the potentiality it contains — the ability to do a lot more with less, and the immense creative energy that gets released when one has to be frugal. There are jugaad revolutions happening all around us in this metropolis, and it totally turns me on to go to work each morning and be part of them.

A cultural renaissance

Let us consider some of the players in the cultural ecosystem, one of the worlds I operate in. Parel has two new cool spaces that have come up recently: Sitara Studio for performances and jam sessions, and Matterden, an independent film showcase at Deepak Talkies. In nearby Mahalaksmi, architect Anuradha Parikh has launched G5A, a community and cultural centre inside a repurposed Laxmi Mills warehouse. The Hive in Bandra’s Chuim village is a bungalow that houses stand-up comedy, theatre, music and film, alongside a co-working space and a café. In Borivali, artists Shreyas Karle and Hemali Bhuta run CONA for art practitioners, students, and their neighbourhood. And in Vikhroli, our Godrej India Culture Lab has been thriving ever since its inception five years ago.

So, I’m rather perplexed by the moaning and groaning when, in fact, we’re in the midst of a cultural renaissance. One way of trying to understand it is to consider who it is that is doing the lamenting. Is it the increasing irrelevant SoBo crowd that I like to tease by calling ‘so boring’? This would be understandable because they are certainly being marginalised. Most of the action in Mumbai (business or culture) has shifted to what was the erstwhile periphery, and losing power does make people cranky.

But for the rest of us, the suburbs have widened the cultural landscape of the city. Helped by infrastructural facilities like the new Metro that provides east-west connectivity, the suburbs are no longer margins, or surplus spaces for cultural footnotes. They are finally key nodes of activity in their own right. And residents of these suburbs, like those in the wonderful Vikhroli, aren’t lamenting. They are, in fact, rejoicing in the ‘spirit of Mumbai’, through the transgender dance performances, feminist film festivals, and more, that they witness regularly.

The entire city is now an experimental playground. The trendy biennale format has been re-imagined in Dharavi as a health-oriented community event. At the last edition, residents collaborated alongside established artists. It was the most exciting art event I’ve been to in Mumbai. In Vikhroli, we gave the art pop-up a local touch by locating our two mammoth Culture Lab events in Godrej factories. There are constant public art takeovers across the city, such as the mural painted in Bandra of Dadasaheb Phalke by the Bollywood Art Project.

Sameera Iyengar and Sanjna Kapoor’s Junoon, a stage for theatre, shifts location between the Bhau Daji Lad Mumbai City Museum in Byculla and the Somaiya School in Vidyavihar, and takes its community everywhere it goes. Mumbai has multiple film festivals — MAMI is the most famous, but to me, equally important are the Navi Mumbai film festival and the Kashish Mumbai International Queer Film Festival. I could go on, describing the vibrant live music scene, the innovative stand-up comedy circuit, and the efforts of creative producers such as Vijay Nair and his OML team, to catalyse both of these, but I think you get the point by now.

What excites me further is that the city’s cultural scene is not just moving outward, but it is also moving towards greater inter-sectionality. Elite high-culture institutions, with rules, regulations, procedures, and strict codes of who gets in and not are ceding ground to jugaadu collaborations between companies, individuals, not-for-profit organisations, online communities, and other stakeholders in society. This kind of inter-sectionality democratises culture and creates a fertile ground for creativity to flourish.

Not enough funding

Now, I’m not trying to paint an overtly rosy picture for you. Culture is severely underfunded in this city. Unlike other great cities, Mumbai doesn’t have significant civic budgets for art and culture, and the authorities seem to try their best to create roadblocks instead of bridges. So everything that happens in the city happens despite severe constraints. Cultural practitioners have different sustenance models, and survival is not easy, or guaranteed. This is why, more than ever, I feel we need to celebrate all those who exhibit chutzpah in this city.

Sponsors are either found (with the Mahindra Blues or Jio MAMI, for instance) or not (with the Control+ALT+Delete music festival, which has made an art form out of crowdfunding); permissions are sought, and often got at the last moment (with the several editions of Kala Ghoda); and all kinds of drama-baazi takes place, but things happen. And when they do, they are world-class, magical, and give you goose bumps. To me, Mumbai continues to remain as the coolest creative and cultural experiment in the world — a place where great ideas come together to rub up against each other.

Does Mumbai need more money? Hell, yeah. We’ll hustle and it’ll come. Could it do with more time and attention from the authorities or the general public? Sure. Its jugaadu culture players will take anything that you can give it. That’s how we roll. But keep your negativity and laments about the death of this beautiful crazy city we love to yourselves, please. I’m choosing to stand in the Geeta Dutt corner, singing gloriously that, in fact, Ae dil hai aasaan jeena yahan, suno mister, suno bandhu yeh hai Bombay meri jaan .

The recent heavy record deluge of rainfall over Chennai was due to above normal sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal, presence of monsoon trough close to Chennai, prevailing easterly waves and strong easterly winds. The 2015 El Nino phenomenon weakened South west monsoon winds which in turn led to less churning and upwelling in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea and resulted in higher sea surface temperatures due to less mixing of cold waters with warm surface waters. This had a warming effect in Bay of Bengal. During the post-NW monsoon withdrawal period (later part of October and November) a monsoon trough prevailed around 13N latitude (latitude of Chennai) over peninsular India and Bay of Bengal.

The monsoon trough is a large area of low pressure that can move in any direction and carry convective winds with it. The high SSTs moistened the boundary layer (the lowest layer of the atmosphere in touch with the ocean surface) by evaporation. This moist air was lifted high up in the atmosphere by easterly waves emanating some distance from the coast at Chennai. Easterly waves are an atmospheric phenomenon wherein the wind moves in a wave like motion with the distance from crest to crest being as much as 2000 km (with a forward and rear sections of 1000 km each) and the period about two to three days. “Therefore it can be believed that the phenomenon might have persisted for 3 -4 days with spatial scales of approximately 500-1000km,”said Dr. J.R. Kulkarni, Team Expert, World Meteorological Organization, Ex-Adviser, IITM, Pune, to this Correspondent with whom he was in telephone and email contact.

The upward motion of the winds in the wave is called divergence and the downward, convergence. The divergence lifted moisture bearing air with it and carried it high up into the atmosphere as rain bearing clouds, and the easterly winds drove these clouds towards Chennai where they precipitated as rain. The continuous formation of clouds over Bay of Bengal, their transformation into deep convective clouds, their movement towards land and to Chennai city provided continuous heavy rainfall over land and the Chennai area. These clouds provided very heavy rainfall of the order of 150 mm/hour. If the rainfall is more than 100 mm/hour, then it is termed as a cloud burst.

For converting water into vapour, energy is required to provide to the water molecules. This energy is called latent heat of vaporization. As the water vapor goes up it cools due to ambient cooler atmosphere. It becomes saturated. The water vapor turns into water droplets. In this process, the energy stored in the water vapor is released to the atmosphere. This heats the cloud air. The cloud air becomes warm and light. The cloud air gets acceleration in upward direction because of receiving of latent heat. Temperature in the atmosphere decreases with height. At about 5 km above the ground, temperature becomes 0°C. This is called freezing level. The cloud drops freeze and become ice above freezing level. In the freezing process heat is released which is called latent heat of freezing. The cloud droplets and ice particles get additional upward motion by getting this energy. This way the cloud grows to a very high altitude.

Studies have shown that south west and north east monsoons have negative correlation. North east monsoon during the 2009 El Nino year was stronger than normal. Rainfall in 2009 north east monsoon was 12 per cent more than long term normal (IMD Departmental website Chennai). This year’s high north east monsoon rainfall performance is consistent with earlier findings of negative correlation between the two monsoons in the El Nino years. The higher than normal sea surface temperatures are the real fuel of such deep convection. Climatologically these anomalies weaken in the December. Therefore it may be conjectured that heavy rainfall activity may weaken in December. “Radar data are required to check movement of clouds, their transformation into deep convective clouds, and their spatial and temporal scales.

“Extreme weather events are indeed increasing due to global warming. This is because a warmer climate can hold more moisture in the atmosphere, leading to heavier rainfall when it does occur. However, it’s difficult to say for certain that a particular extreme event – like the Chennai floods – is attributable to anthropogenic climate change,” says Dr. Roxy Mathew Koll of The Indian Institute of Tropical Maeteorology, Pune.",discussion,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city and suburbs,494 mm,"Rs. 10,000 crore",464,1.2 million people displaced,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including above-normal sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal, the presence of a monsoon trough close to Chennai, prevailing easterly waves, and strong easterly winds.

If Dreher were in flood-hit Chennai last week, he would surely have expanded his list to include the celebrities and common citizens who hit the ground running. But would that complete the list?

What happens after the fires have been put out, lives saved and the last news report filed? What happens after the last citizen and celebrity leave? Who takes the disaster zone back to looking as good as new? Who wipes out the bloodstains? Who scrapes up the rotting flesh?

After front page odes to the heroes of the floods, many local newspapers in Chennai carried a small report inside on December 7 announcing that more than 2,000 sanitation workers from across Tamil Nadu had arrived in the city to clean up the mess. They had to be called in because most of Chennai’s sanitation workers hadn’t turned up to work. Most of the slums they live in are also under the dirty water.

But even if they all had turned up for work, the clean-up wouldn’t be easy; all of Chennai is today one large, festering, open air toilet.

Dalits suffered more than others in flood-hit Cuddalore: Report

The city has around 7,000 sanitation workers, according to R Anbuvedan, state president of the Republican Trade Union of India, which was started by BR Ambdekar. “The population of Chennai is 85 lakh, meaning one sanitation worker is cleaning the waste generated by around 1,200 people. The central government norms say that there should be three sanitary workers per thousand people,” says Anbuvelan who is also a member of the corporation’s manpower reorganisning committee.

According to the city corporation, each person in the city generates 700 grams of waste per day. Chennai generates the highest per capita garbage in the country. That’s 870 kilos of garbage per sanitary worker per day. But that’s on good, floodless days.

It is strange that Dreher doesn’t add sanitation workers to his list of American heroes. It could only be because sanitation workers don’t exactly ‘run’ dramatically towards a disaster zone. It surely can’t be because Dreher doesn’t consider their work disaster management. Because every morning--with trashcans and sewers full of putrefying human, animal and chemical waste--every city in the world is a potential disaster zone. And what we conventionally consider disaster zones must also be cleaned up.

The US department of labour says that sanitation work is among the 10 most dangerous jobs in that country. The department’s report says that sanitary workers--a majority of whom are Black or people of colour--are four times more likely to die of work-related hazards than firemen or cops. And journalism did not make it to the top 10.

Under Indian law, a sanitation worker must be given gloves, masks, gumboots, towels, soap and oil. “If a sanitation worker is not given proper protecive equipment, it constitutes a crime according to the Prohibition of Manual Scavenging Act. The act says that if they are not given protective gear, their work will amount to manual scavenging,” Anbuvedan says.

Reporting under shadow of defamation gun in flood-ravaged Chennai

As many as 78 men from the Dindigul municipalty are camping in a mariage hall in Gajalakshmi colony of Chennai. They were provided with only seven gumboots. None of them have been given gloves, masks, soap or oil.

These luxuries haven’t been granted to local sanitary workers either. “I was given gloves and chappals (not gumboots) but they don’t fit properly. It is not easy to work with ill fitting equipment,” says Kannamma, 50, a sanitary worker with the Chennai corporation. She confirms that she has cleaned human excrement with her bare hands and says, “Toilets everywhere are flooded. Half of the city is defecating in the open. And there are the dead animals.”

At the north zonal headquarters of the Chennai corporation a sanitary supervisor proudly boasts that the workers have been provided with footwear, gloves and masks. When she is persuaded to show the equipment, it turns out the gloves are made of cloth, the footwear is rubber slippers and the masks are made of a kind of sheer material. All the cops and firemen though have been given nicely fitting gumboots that stand out because of their bright yellow soles.

Only around 700 of the 7,000 sanitary workers in the city are permanent employees of the corporation and get above Rs 15,000 per month. The rest are on contract and are paid anywhere between Rs 200 and Rs 290 as daily wages. No work means no pay. There are no sick leaves. “The corporation hasn’t hired permanent sanitary staff for 15 years. There is a severe manpower shortage,” says Anbuvedan.

Kannamma, whose house in the Ezhil Nagar slum is under waist-deep water, is back at work. She has been a permanent employee of the city corporation for the last eight years and is entitled to all the leaves that other government servants get. “Nobody has told me how many leaves I can take. I don’t understand these things because I am not educated. I have come to work because I don’t want my salary cut,” she says.

Here is another well known fact: all of Chennai’s and indeed all of Tamil Nadu’s sanitation workers are either Dalits or Adivasis. Most of them are from the Arundhadiyar Scheduled Caste.

“Everybody in Chennai has suffered equally because of the floods. But only my people will go through the extra suffering of cleaning Chennai’s rotting s**t. Why can’t the concerned citizens and celebrities who are distributing food and blankets also clean up the city? Why is the media only projecting them as heroes?” asks Ravichandran Bathran, a postdoctoral fellow at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study who is also from the Arundhadiyar community.

“Everybody complains of resevations in higher institutions but nobody talks about reservations in the lower institutions. In the business of cleaning s**t, there is 100% reservation for Dalits. Why don’t people from other castes join this work?” says Ravichandran.

To be fair, a handful of the citizens’ groups have picked up the broom. The Jamat-e-Islami Hind made headlines when they cleaned Hindu temples. The residents of Choolaimedu cleaned up their own trash and proudly put up photos on Facebook that were shared 10,000 times at last count. And one Tamil actor is planning to organise a team of citizens who will get down to cleaning. They are waiting for protective gear to arrive.

“They will clean the streets but will they clean the gutters? Will they get into manholes that are clogged with rubbish? Even if they do, they will surely wear all the protective equipment,” says A Narayanan, director of Change India, an NGO that works for the eradication of manual scavenging.

The first signs of an epidemic are already here. Doctors in many government hospitals in the city are confirming cases of rat fever, jaundice and mosquito-borne diseases. While there are bound to be glorious exceptions, as a rule, it will be a silent army of people, mostly belonging to one lowered caste, that will fight this danger with their bare hands.

The sanitary workers are now working in those parts of the city that have not been heavily inundated by the floods. They are waiting for the waters to subside in the worst affected areas. It may be weeks before the water recedes. By then the trash would have decomposed some more. By then most of the cops, firemen and reporters might be back to their regular beats.

For most people stranded in rain-hit Chennai, taking a flight to neighbouring cities has been a bleak option over the last few days. Not just due to the fact that the Chennai airport has been flooded, but also because tickets are priced as high as Rs 50,000 one way.On Thursday and Friday, domestic airfares for flights departing from Bangalore skyrocketed. National carrier Air India was charging fares as high as Rs 51,750 for a business class ticket for its flight to Delhi from Bangalore for Friday, while Jet Airways fare was Rs 47,000.""I had to take a flight to Jaipur from Bangalore but I couldn't as the prices were around Rs 26,000, so I had to make other provisions and now I'm going via Mumbai,"" said Shubham Arya, a passenger travelling from Bangalore after making it out of flood-affected Chennai.Flights to Ahmedabad cost more than Rs 20,000 and Mumbai around Rs 19,000. This steep hike invoked sharp criticism from passengers and experts who blame the high ticket prices on the lack of clear rules in place for airline companies.""What we need is for the Civil Aviation Authority to regulate pricing and penalise people who fail to do this. Till this happens, such uncontrolled rise in prices will continue and passengers with continue to suffer,"" said Sudhakara Reddy the President of Air Passengers Association of India.Meanwhile, the Airlines claim that they have started operating rescue flights out of Chennai.""We are actually doing two things, one, we are operating rescue flights and taking it to the nearest naval base and that's completely for the passengers out of there. That is 45 minutes away from Chennai, so either the army is airlifting passengers and taking them to their place or we are just flying in there and flying them out.""The Chennai airport was shut down on Tuesday evening after the runway was flooded following incessant rain.

In the case of Chennai, there was one key cause: the Adyar river basin has been taken over for the new airport, just as other stretches have been used to develop residential spaces. Denied its natural path, excess water flooded the neighbourhood. Till nature unleashed its excess, planners ignored the risks; and, look what we got.

We have seen this pattern play out earlier in Mumbai and more recently in the devastating floods that gutted Srinagar. And almost in every instance, the central cause is easy to ascertain: unplanned urbanization inspired by an utter disregard for basic norms. Yet, every time the import of the tragedy fades along with public memory. Like in Chennai, a disaster is waiting to happen in Delhi, with authorities, in their wisdom, allowing some of the flood plains to accommodate the swanky Commonwealth Games village.

It is this business-as-usual approach that is worrying. This struck home with the passing of another dubious milestone last week: The 31st anniversary of the Bhopal gas tragedy—India’s worst industrial disaster. It passed by almost unnoticed (unlike its 30th anniversary). The tragedy, as in the case of Chennai, is that there is no evidence that any lessons have been learnt, leave alone the fact that the inadequately compensated people affected by the tragedy are still dealing with the deadly consequences of the methyl isocyanate gas leak.

It is not just the frequency of disasters—which is alarmingly on the rise—it is that the country is particularly risk-prone. Due to a combination of topography and high population density, India is particularly vulnerable to disasters, and the authorities are well aware of it. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the apex body for disaster management, provides us a risk profile on its website:

* More than 58.6% of the landmass is prone to earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity

* More than 40 million hectares (12%) of its land is prone to floods and river erosion

* Close to 5,700km, out of the 7,516km long coastline, is prone to cyclones and tsunamis

* 68% of its cultivable area is vulnerable to droughts (several states, particularly in central and north India, are suffering the ravages of back-to-back droughts in the past two years)

* Its hilly areas are at risk from landslides and avalanches (as the flash floods in Leh and Ladakh underlined in 2010).

The NDMA’s website has this humbling homily to add: “Disaster risks in India are further compounded by increasing vulnerabilities related to changing demographics and socioeconomic conditions, unplanned urbanization, development within high-risk zones, environmental degradation, climate change, geological hazards, epidemics and pandemics.""

And what it says next is what should serve as a wake-up call to all—governments as well as citizens. Clearly, all these “contribute to a situation where disasters seriously threaten India’s economy, its population and sustainable development"". If this is not enough to drive home the point, then check out a recent report by the World Resources Institute (WRI), which says that India tops the list of 163 nations affected by river floods in terms of the number of people. According to it, every year, the lives of 4.85 million Indians are disrupted by floods, risking $14.3 billion of gross domestic product.

It is apparent then that India is at risk from disasters. It is also obvious that urbanization and high-density population pockets are emerging as the new way of life. Take the two together and there is only one conclusion: without sustainability, India’s urbanization is a recipe for disaster.

(Source: Express photo by Narendra Vaskar)

In Uran, off Mumbai’s eastern coast, the fishermen haven’t been this angsty ever. As plans for the ambitious fourth container terminal of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) are finalised, locals as well as environmentalists are warning of construction work along a delicate coastline, work that could prove lethal for the already diminishing mangrove cover and marine life in the area. Besides the destruction of breeding grounds affecting the local fish population, the fishermen say the proposed reclamation could have a direct impact on the coastline’s ability to soak in flood waters.

In October, Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and other dignitaries laid the foundation stone for the fourth terminal project, estimated to cost Rs 7,915 crore.

In the first phase, JNPT will reclaim 200 hectares of land along the shore as well as 19.5 hectares of land covered by dense mangroves, for rail and road access. “The same area needs to be diverted for non-forest activities by diverting the mangrove vegetation,” says an application filed by JNPT in the Bombay High Court, dated September 22, 2015.

JNPT is proposing to re-plant the mangroves elsewhere, and has deposited Rs 3.4 crore towards compensatory afforestation.

Along the coast at Uran, reclamation activity has already begun, truckfuls of earth being dumped daily along the shore. Fishing communities in the hamlets of Sheva, Nhava, Gavhan, Belpada, Sonari, Jaskhar, Panje, Dongri, Funde, Uran and Elephanta will be affected by this reclamation, fishermen say. The creeks and other water bodies around these coastal villages serve as grounds for fish spawning in a rich marine ecosystem.

While parts of these areas are under CIDCO which has a Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP), JNPT acquired a part of land for setting up its port back in 1989.

Along this stretch, while a pungency in the air marks the influx of container ships to the three busy JNPT terminals on one side, a lush band of vegetation on the other side becomes visible as the tide ebbs. If the seaward side is threatened by the port construction, steady construction on the landweard side is set to change the area forever as CIDCO starts executing its Smart City plans. Empty buildings with “To-Let” and “flat available” signs stand where once lay mudflats and salt pans, says Dilip Koli, a local fisherman.

JNPT Chairman Anil Diggikar told The Indian Express that despite the proposals, the agency is keen to protect mangroves. “We have to abide by all the existing laws of NGT, Environment Department. All the necessary clearances are taken and only then work commences,” Diggikar said.

Niteen A Deshpande, Manager of JNPT’s Port Planning and Development Department, clarified that permission being sought from the court is only for the mangrove transplantation. “For reclamation, permission is not required,” he said. “Work has not yet started as far as removal of mangroves goes.”

Deshpande, who has filed the application in the High Court on behalf of the JNPT, says the removed vegetation will be “transplanted” to another area. However, an observation made by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) while deciding on a matter between the local fishermen and various government authorities shows otherwise.

On March 22, 2014, the NGT had directed officials of the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority, JNPT, CIDCO and representatives of the fisherfolk to visit a proposed reclamation site. Though JNPT then promised to transplant mangroves that were uprooted due to expansion of existing jetties at Nhava Creek, this was not done. The NGT, in an order dated MAY 27, 2014, observed: “At the above site, MCZMA team observed that debris is only partially removed from the creek by the JNPT, due to which, restoration of the width of the creek and natural flow of tidal water is not achieved.”

The NGT also pointed out that the expansion of port activities and the fourth container terminal project, after narrowing the creek-let between Nhava and Sheva, would create an artificial bottleneck for tidal water flow. This, the NGT said, would make it difficult for fishermen’s boats to have egress and ingress into the sea.

“The record shows that reclamation of land in the area is likely to cause environmental damage to flora and fauna. The stock of fishes, spawning, breeding and marine culture will diminish stock of fishes and variety thereof within the area of sea, near the creek. The traditional fishermen would be at the receiving end,” the order observed.

Ramdas Koli, a local fisherman who petitioned the NGT, says around 80 per cent of the mangrove land in the area has fallen prey to continuous reclamation. “Uran is within a radius of 10 km of Mumbai and this reclamation and destruction of wetlands will have a direct consequence on the tidal flow in Mumbai,” he said.

The local fishermen have unanimously objected to the port’s expansion saying their fishing area is being reclaimed. They also say they’re being stopped from fishing near the site of the project. They point to a significant fall in quantity of large fish and crustaceans, citing the mangrove destruction as the prime cause.

“With the destruction of mangroves, crabs, lobsters and other big fish that used to come and lay eggs in the mangroves have reduced in large numbers affecting business considerably,” says Dilip Koli.

Environmentalist Debi Goenka, whose Conservation Action Trust is one of the petitioners in the case, says JNPT’s permissions dated 2008 for the fourth container terminal project from the Ministry of Environment and Forests should be considered as expired, following the passage of five years.

“The ministry renewed it in 2014 on the lines of the earlier environmental clearance. In between, a new CRZ notification had come in 2011 that was not taken into consideration.” Secondly, in 2014, the JNPT changed the project profile without seeking fresh environmental clearances, he says. “Importantly, the CZMP which was approved by MoEF in 2005 specifically says the mudflats and mangroves cannot be destroyed. Here this project involves 200 hectares of mudflats and mangroves. So, the ecological and hydrological impact has not even been considered,” he says.

The mouth of the creek near JNPT used to be 1,500 metres wide, now down to 400 metres following reclamation activities, Goenka says, adding that flooding in Mumbai appears inevitable. After Chennai this year and Mumbai’s encounter with floods in 2005, Goenka says, prolonged reclamation of low-lying wetlands will put Mumbai in dire straits.

THE LEGAL TUSSLE

In 2005, a landmark Bombay High Court judgment emphasised preservation of the ever-shrinking mangrove wetlands. Besides ordering a “total freeze” on the cutting of mangroves across Maharashtra, it asked the state government to use remote sensing to demarcate mangrove land. Regardless of the ownership of such land, the government was directed, construction within 50 meters on all sides of mangroves had to be stopped.

In 2010, however, these norms were relaxed considerably. Though the court said no non-forest activity should take place in such areas, nothing prevented the authorities, private bodies and their contractors from approaching the competent authorities to seek permission for their projects that were likely to affect mangroves.

The court reasoned that neither had the government notified these areas as ordered nor had it distinguished lands that fell in private and public ownership. Later, in 2014, JNPT filed an application seeking a reprieve on the basis of court’s 2010 order. It sought the court’s nod to develop a standalone container with a jetty of length 330 meters.

During one of the hearings of JNPT’s request on the fourth container, the Bombay Environment Action Group informed the court that re-transplantation of mangroves, as promised by JNPT, is proposed in an area which is a not a coastal zone but a forest area. The JNPT has maintained in its plea that it has never violated laws on environment protection in the area nor has it carried out any non-forest activities.",issue,Mumbai floods,"Mumbai, India",2005-07-02,2005-07-04,Mumbai,944 mm,"Rs 25,000 crore","1,000",Flooding caused widespread damage to infrastructure and homes.,The floods were caused by a combination of heavy rainfall and poor drainage.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

However, as the situation in Chennai has gotten worse, there also seemed to be some hope as many people have risen to the occasion to provide whatever relief and rescue is possible.

An earlier Firstpost article mentioned how Twitter users have been leading the relief effort online. From updates about the situation on ground, to a dedicated Google sheet and website chennairains.org to collate all information, social media has been instrumental is helping Chennai get back on its feet. Be they gathering supplies through crowdsourcing, checking up on people who have lost connectivity or offering shelter, the impact of social media was evident. Even Twitter India has been using hashtags such as #ChennaiRainsHelp to gather all relevant information and several others have been using it to either ask for aid or help out the ones who are in need.

Leading the effort from the front are two popular personalities who have chosen to go out on the streets and help people themselves. Actor Siddharthand RJ Balaji from Big FM 92.7 have gotten together a team of volunteers to assist the people stranded in Chennai. In a rare instance of a celebrity going out on ground zero, Siddharth and Balaji have done some exceptional work by co-ordinating relief activities in the city by tweeting out advice, listing down supplies needed and guiding volunteers. They have introduced the hashtag #ChennaiMicro for the conveneiicne of picking up of parcels and giving out other information.

December 1993 remains etched in Madurai’s memory, though the earliest recorded flood was in December 1677, when many huts in the villages around the city were swept away. Rainfall triggered by a severe cyclonic storm between December 1 and 4, 1993, resulted in release of about one lakh cusecs of water into the Vaigai. Simultaneously, the Sathayar dam, a minor reservoir that conserves water flowing in a jungle stream and surplus from dams upstream in Dindigul and Theni districts, overflowed due to heavy rainfall in the Sirumalai Hills. The surplus filled up 14 tanks and resulted in breaches and water release. In Madurai city, a major tank in Sellur breached, submerging many areas in the north.

The 1993 flood was preceded by flooding of the Vaigai in November 1992 when 520 mm rainfall was recorded in a single day in the Manalar Estate of Megamalai in Theni district. This triggered a series of landslides in Megamalai in which at least 37 people were killed.

Flood marooned north Madurai, where almost all the government departments are located. Water entered the Government Rajaji hospital and telecommunication network was cut off. The worst impact was in Sellur, the hub of world famous handloom industry, where about 12,000 looms fell silent. The industry has not recovered from this mortal blow. Many were forced to leave their homes and a few deaths were reported in Sellur. It took three days for the flood water to recede.

The flood was caused by chocking of storm water carriers. Madurai, once a city of tanks, had 46 water bodies, of which only seven are alive now. Many are in disuse or used to drain sewage. Sixteen tanks have been filled with buildings. Reacting to the flood, the Madurai Corporation implemented a scheme to desilt all storm water canals in 1994. Encroachments in the Vaigai and major canals were removed and people given alternative sites to set up home in Sakkimangalam, far away from Madurai. Later, all streets were provided with storm water drains. After two decades, the Vaigai continues to remain in a state of neglect and water carriers are used to liberally dump urban waste.

After December 1677, the next flood was accompanied by a cyclone on December 18, 1709. According to B.S. Balinga’s report in the Madurai District Gazetteer , most of the tanks breached at that time and “a mighty wave of water surged through the district carrying everything before it.” A “terrific storm” swept Madurai neighbourhood in November 1814, killing 3000 cattle. The Vaigai witnessed “extraordinary freshes” in December 1843. An “unusually high flood” was seen in 1884. The Vaigai overflowed on November 30 and December 1, 1922, when “flood water reached as far as the Meenakshi Temple on the southern side and invaded Goripalayam in the north. Every railway line leaving Madurai was breached and Sholavandan station was under water.” After the opening of the Vaigai dam on January 29, 1959, the river was in spate in 1977 and 1979, when a chopper involved in rescue operation went down.",,1993 Madurai Flood,"Madurai, Tamil Nadu","December 1, 1993","December 4, 1993",North Madurai,1 lakh cusecs,"12,000 looms fell silent",a few,The industry has not recovered from this mortal blow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

In a letter to Modi, she said: “Many parts of the state have been severely affected due to flooding. (A total of) 169 lives were lost during this northeast monsoon since October 1, and there was widespread damage to property including dwelling units and crops.

“The requirement of funds for immediate rescue and relief and the temporary and permanent restoration of infrastructure has been worked out at Rs 8,481 crores in all.”

Modi also agreed to the Tamil Nadu CM’s demand for a central team to be dispatched to the state to assess the damage and release aid. More funds would be given to the state after the team submits its report, television channel NDTV quoted a government source as saying.

The chief minister sought the assistance from the National Disaster Response Fund and other central funds.

Requesting Modi to depute a central team to make its on-the-spot assessment, Jayalalithaa had urged him to release Rs 2,000 crore towards relief and restoration operations right away.

According to Jayalalithaa, infrastructure, including roads and bridges, storm water drains, water supply, sewage and electricity supply systems had been battered in many areas.

“A deep depression of high intensity formed in the Bay of Bengal and hit the Tamil Nadu coast near Marakkanam, causing extremely heavy rains particularly in the four northern coastal districts of Cuddalore, Kancheepuram, Chennai and Tiruvallur,” she said.

According to her, based on the forecast received from the Indian Meteorological Department and the alerts received from the National Disaster Management Agency, adequate precautionary measures were taken which minimised loss to life and property.

“More than 4 lakh people were shifted to relief camps and provided food and shelter. Rescue and relief operations were undertaken on a war footing,” Jayalalithaa told Modi.

Several low-lying areas in Kancheepuram, including major thoroughfare Gandhi Road, were inundated as the town and its neighbourhood received a heavy precipitation of 34 cm during the 24-hours that ended with 8.30 a.m. on Friday.

The town experienced heavy downpour from around 11 p.m. on Thursday night to till early morning on Friday.

The Manjalneer Kalvai, primarily a flood drain channel for the town, overflowed after the Netteri lake breached on the Kancheepuram-Vellore Road in the wee hours of Friday, flooding the entire stretch of Gandhi Road and Munusamy Mudaliyar Avenue and forcing the police to close for traffic the prime junction Moongil Mandapam where the Gandhi Road joins with Vallal Pachaiyappan Salai. However, the water on the Gandhi Road and Munusamy Mudaliyar Avenue receded in the afternoon.

The Gundukulam lake near Kathirpur also breached resulting in flooding of the Vegavathi river, which was already filled up with flood water that drained from Sevilimedu tank due to unchecked growth of dwelling units along its bank between Pillayarpalayam and up to Nagaluthumedu in Little Kancheepuram. The overflowing water from the river inundated agricultural fields and residential areas, before draining into the Manjalneer Kalvai on Krishnan Street.

Rengasamykulam and Ashtabhujam tank, located in the vicinity of Gandhi Road, however, received minimum inflow despite heavy precipitation overnight.

Collector R.Gajalakshmi told reporters later that a total of 7,294 persons were rescued from inundated areas and accommodated in 26 shelters opened by the civic body.

Boats were used to rescue the people from inundated areas in Pillayarpalayam, the Collector said.

Water flow in river Palar

Kancheepuram residents were elated to see both the banks of Palar near Sevilimedu and Orikkai flowing with water.

Chennai swamped

The overnight rainstorm in Chennai swamped several areas in the city and suburbs, flooding houses in low level and paralysed daily life on Friday.

Puzhal recorded the highest volume of 21 cm of rainfall. The weather stations in Chennai and Meenambakkam recoded 15 cm and 12 cm. However, during the day, the city received only 1 cm of rain.

Residents of several areas, including Ambattur, Avadi, Thirumullaivoyal and Mudichur are confined to their homes in knee deep level water.

City opens its doors

It’s early yet on Wednesday morning, but Dr. Sai Kishore from Paalavakkam is busy wading through water-logged streets, handing out packets of food to those in need. The medico who runs the K.L. Hospital in Neelankarai, threw open his hospital doors for those stranded in the rain. “As of last evening we had at least 10 families take shelter at the hospital. We went around picking up those stranded in the hospital ambulance. After a point though the ambulance could not ply on the water-logged streets. Now, my team and I are going around the area distributing packets of food that we cooked in the hospital mess to those in need,” he explains, adding, “The way the city has come together to help others in need is very encouraging. There is such a sense of unity at this time of crisis.”Help came from all corners as Sowmya Reddy put together a crowd-sourced Google doc encouraging people to open up their homes to those affected by the floods. With nearly 225 volunteers posting their contact details and offering to host people in their homes, the list has come as a boon for the city.

Naveen Kumar, an IT employee who lives in Kotturpuram, had people from the Mandaveli area seek refuge at his house. “I did the same last week and am more than willing to host people this time round too. The situation is pretty bad and it’s the one way I could extend help, so why not? I had two people come over last night and we provided them with food and shelter,” he says.

While Suresh Kumar, a volunteer from Medavakkam, didn’t receive any calls from people looking for shelter, he did receive calls from people wading through the flood waters and looking for some food. “A group of people got in touch with me through my listing. They had been walking from OMR to Kovilavakkam through water-logged streets and were looking for something to eat, before they could continue their walk home. I got food packed from a nearby restaurant and went and gave it to them. Anybody looking for shelter is most welcome to get in touch with me,” he says.

Help comes from New York

Krtgrphr, a New York-based Chennaiite spent 15 hours volunteering information on the Internet Kartik, who goes by @krtgrphr on Twitter, is managing many tabs on his laptop sitting in New York. On any other day, this would seem like a normal activity for someone who is online a lot, but Tuesday night and Wednesday morning were all about offering help to strangers stranded in Chennai due to the rain. Krtgrphr (who prefers to go by his Twitter handle) has been volunteering for 15 hours non-stop so far, and is still going strong. From contributing to the document on '#ChennaiRains Resource Center' (chennairains.org) to just as simply spreading the word by retweeting important information and sharing important numbers, the 29-year-old researcher for IBM is making a difference, just like many others on popular social networking sites.

“There’s so much to do behind the scenes; we’re all just a bunch of people who have time on our hands,” he says. On Twitter, trying to find information on what was going on in Chennai, krtgrphr admits that he was feeling helpless about not being able to “effect change on the ground. So you try to do anything you can.”

While a lot of people have opened up their homes, some have started distributing food packets, water and clothes in their areas. How can people sitting at home help? “They can help us right now by connecting those without connections or power or battery to rescue services, food, shelter etc.

And help anyone you see around,” he urges. As a former resident of Chennai, krtgrphr is one of the many who has used social media to effect change for the good. “It’s the participants that make Twitter what it really is.”

Fishermen sail in to help

The fishermen of Chennai are rowing their boats in the flooded streets of the city to rescue those who are stranded. Boats from places such as Kasimedu, Kottivakkam Kuppam, and Kovalam are being transported in trucks along with fishermen-volunteers to the flood-hit regions. “We rescued some 400 people since morning,” says Selvam, a fisherman from Kovalam. A trained life-guard and surfer, Selvam reached Pallikaranai early in the day along with 18 men from the fishing village.

“We’ve brought three fibre boats, each of which can carry 18 people,” he calls out on the phone from the rescue site over the sound of ambulance sirens. “Those we ferried to safety are all from settlements along the Pallikaranai marsh; they’ve lost everything.”

Selvam and team have put in place a well-planned rescue operation. “The moment we help people into our boats, we row towards safe zones that our men have identified. They wait there for us along with a local who guides us,” he explains. Fisherman Mohan from Kottivakkam also had an early start as he made his way in his fibre boat to rescue those who were stranded. “A lot of men from the kuppam have gone along with him,” says his wife Nithya. “They’ve taken several boats with them… I hope they’re all safe.”

M.D. Dayalan, president of the Indian Fishermen Association, says that Kasimedu alone has offered 40 boats for rescue work. “Our men are coordinating with the Fisheries Department. Boats from as far as Neelankarai and Kanathur are in the city, helping people in low-lying areas.”

Restaurants spring into action

With rescue efforts pouring in, some of the restaurants in the city have also sprung into action. On Tuesday night Japtej Ahluwalia and Nikesh Lamba of Double Roti offered complimentary meals at their outlets in Neelankarai and Cenotaph Road. “Quite a few families passing by stopped for a bite. A lot of cyclists and two-wheeler riders came in too for a quick hot meal,” says Japtej. With the inner roads of Neelankarai flooding, more people ended up in that outlet. Maggi was the most popular dish followed by burgers and sandwiches.

Old Madras Baking Company (OMBC) too welcomed wet stranded passersby for a hot cup of tea/coffee and some sandwiches at all their outlets. Sandy’s, Ox and Tomato and OMBC are open to accommodating people to spend the night there as well. “On Tuesday night about six people spent the night at Sandy’s in Ganapathy Colony,” says Mansi Sandesh Reddy. Tryst cafe put together food boxes to be dispatched to people in need.

VOICES

Anita Ratnam, classical and contemporary dancer-choreographer

Her house is full of people; just waking up to steaming cups of tea after a long, frightening night. “I was on my way to the airport with a group of ten dancers yesterday to catch a flight to Thailand for a contemporary dance festival. We got into the car at 8 p.m., and eventually gave up because we could not access the airport. We got home at midnight, and on the way I saw eight to nine people huddled under a big tree outside my house. It was terrible,” says Anita.

She responded by opening her home to as many people as she could house, a total of 18, including all the dancers. “I also handed out everything I could: towels, blankets, T-shirts… I completely cleaned out the fridge,” she says, “We slept on every available surface, just using cushions, quilts and all my shawls… I didn’t think about it, I just did it. And that’s how the city is responding to the rain.”

She adds, “We are part of a momentous disaster. Whatever we can do, we do. At least this rain has shown one thing about our city: we are extremely hospitable: warm, welcoming and trusting. I’m not surprised people are opening their homes. Remember in Tamil custom we never say goodbye – we say ‘vaanga’, please come.”

“I would have loved to see the glittering establishments of this city throw open their lobbies as well. When 9/11 happened in New York, all the five star hotels ran ads saying, ‘Please come in’. They opened soup kitchens. Here it is the individual citizens who are reflective of the spirit of the city. It is in crisis that character emerges.”

Sam Paul, lawyer and entrepreneur

On Tuesday, as flood waters rose in and around Chennai, Sam Paul rounded a group of friends and family members and started a rescue service. They split into teams and went about rescuing marooned families, supplying food, medicine and offering shelter. Sam’s house as of now is hosting four families. “We rescued a family from Perambur where the water level was 12 feet. Two grandparents and a grandson. We even rescued a dog. Our friends too have opened up their houses for those stranded,” he says.

Till about 7.30 am on Wednesday Sam, Lenin Paul, Ajit Sigamani and Jose Sigamani drove through Mudichur, Velachery, Guduvanchery, Madipakkam and Tambaram getting stranded people out.

Pleased with how people from the city are banding together to lend support, Sam says activist Abdul Ghani and his team too are doing good work. “They even rescued a pregnant woman, who was then admitted to SRM hospital where she delivered a baby,” he says.

In addition Sam’s restaurant chain of Jonah’s is cooking and supplying food for 300 people.

The initiative has grown with more people joining in as volunteers and shortly a Facebook page titled Chennai food, rescue and shelter will be up to spread the message and services.

“Our Covelong boys team helped the stranded during the floods by using whatever was available such as kayaks, catamarans and fishing boats. We rescued around 200 girls from hostels and also other college students. We had fun doing it - clowned around a bit by taking advantage of the empty toll booths.”

Skymet Weather Team

Updated on December 6, 2015 at 4:00 PM (IST): In the last 24 hours, many parts of Cuddalore recorded moderate to heavy rain showers. Moderate rain showers, with isolated heavy at some places, are likely to continue over Cuddalore for another 36 hours.

The low pressure area over SW Bay, off the Tami Nadu and Sri Lanka coast, will continue to affect the region.

Cuddalore is reeling under flood conditions since more than a week now. Rainfall in the region has been equivalent to Chennai and Puducherry rains.

Updated on December 05, 2015 11:30 AM (IST): After Chennai, its Cuddalore that has been facing wrath of Northeast Monsoon vagaries.

Heavy to very heavy rain continued to lash Cuddalore district on Friday as well. In span of last 24 hours from 8:30 am on Friday, Cuddalore recorded 84 mm of rain.

These showers have further added to the ongoing flood fury in the district, which has recorded whopping 536 mm of rain in just first five days of December.

According to Skymet Meteorology Division in India, heavy to very heavy showers will continue over the district for next 24 to 48 hours as well, particularly over southern parts such as Karaikal and Pamban.

The low pressure area in Southwest Bay of Bengal off the Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka coast will continue to persist and keep affecting weather over Coastal Tamil Nadu, especially central and south coast.

Updated on December 04, 2015 11:05 AM (IST): Cuddalore has been witnessing extremely heavy rainfall since last few days. In just five days, from November 30 to December 4, 2015, the city recorded 503 mm of rain. The conditions are similar to Chennai floods and Puducherry rains.

Cuddalore lies on coastal Tamil Nadu which has been witnessing vigorous weather activity, in terms of excessive rains, since last month. The city is located in central coastal Tamil Nadu, to be precise. This region has been battered by incessant heavy rainfall causing water stagnation and inundation.

While rains in and around Chennai did lose steam in the last 24 hours, Cuddalore continued to receive good rains, recording 87 mm in 24 hours from 8:30 am IST on December 3, 2015. On December 3, Cuddalore received 132.8 mm of rain. On December 2 as well, the city received three-figure rainfall, recording a whopping 134.8 mm.

No significant relief is expected along coastal Tamil Nadu before December 8. Patchy rainfall of varying intensity is likely to continue over the region. Thus water levels in Cuddalore may take some time before receding completely. Repeated spells will slow down rescue and relief operations in the region.

Cuddalore’s sufferings have not reached the masses as the focus remains on Chennai floods. Puducherry also continues to reel under flood conditions and is in dire need of volunteers and rescue squads. With relief ops in the region gaining momentum, more help will surely reach Cuddalore in some time.

Religious experts are overawed at this miraculous coincidence.Spiritual guru Mukesh Trivedi from Borivli says the fact that both Kedarnath and Pashupatinath stand tall can be partly attributed to their sturdy and scientific construction centuries ago. “Our forefathers prepared the temple layout with vast boundaries so that many square yards around the shrine were left undisturbed. Now new constructions have encroached upon this territory without a care for environmental balance,” he says.Acharya Avdhesh Kumar Pandey of Birla Mandir, New Delhi, says, “Natural calamities become a time for man to introspect. It is humbling to see Kedarnath and Pashupatinath both remain untouched. The intent behind the construction of a temple matters greatly. These days, large trusts build grand temples and install donation boxes with a view to generating wealth. It shocks me to see that even the idol is sometimes installed without 'pran pratishtha' (consecration). Some sell tickets even to enter, and charge money for boarding and lodging. In olden days temple trusts welcomed sages and saints with grace, and made provision for langar and dharamshalas for visitors. Now they build factories with temple collections.”Ramesh Gandhi, spokesman of Mumbai's Babulnath temple, says, “Both Kedarnath and Pashupatinath are ‘akhand’ (indestructible) because these are considered the holy seat of Lord Shiva.”Mukeshbhai says the warnings contained in the Uttarakhand floods have gone unheeded. “Shrines cannot be treated like picnic spots. Excess tourism and commercialization is detrimental to the peace of these temple towns. Lodges and roads are built on fragile rocky ground. Instead of reopening the shrines within months of the disaster to resume earning revenue, the government should regulate visitors and allow online darshan,” he says.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

As the recent deluge recedes and landmarks in the city become visible once again, sheets of water vanish to reveal the black tar on roads, and a battered population tries to get back to its feet, images of rains, floods and suffering from the past come to the mind.

Though cyclones, depressions and storms are an annual occurrence in Chennai, some years like 1985, when former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran was evacuated from his Ramapuram garden home, or 1976, when the Army stepped in to keep the Manali oil refinery running, are unforgettable.

1903- Rains bring floods

In 1903, the year the Indian National Congress session was held in Madras, the city faced heavy rains and floods. Historian V. Sriram says that leading lawyer and judge of the Madras High Court V. Krishnaswamy Iyer, who was the main force behind the session, had put up delegates at his bungalow on Luz Church Road. “After the session, his work was greatly appreciated by those in the welcoming committee and even by Dada Bhai Navroji, who was impressed by his shraddai ,” he says.

1918 - 'Cyclone of unusual fury'

The year 1918 too was bad. “A terrible cyclone of unusual fury passed through Madras. The Madras public was quite unprepared to meet the uncommon storm as the report was received yesterday and could not be published in the newspapers,” says a report in The Hindu on November 11, 1918.

1943: No trains to ride

Writer Ashokamitran, who came to Madras in 1943 to drop his sister at her husband’s home in Saidapet, recalls how trains wouldn’t ply to Saidapet due to the rain. “We had bought tickets for Saidapet but the train stopped at Mambalam. We took a jutka to Saidapet and dropped her,” he says. It was in 1943 that The Hindu ’s Srinivasan offered to print other newspapers when power supply was restored to The Hindu alone.

The 1985 floods bear a semblance to this year’s fury. The Kotturpuram slum clearance board tenements were flooded, with Ambattur and Madhavaram dairies flooded most of the city went without milk, water from Chembarambakkam was released and people residing on the banks were cautioned to move to safer places. It was this year too that Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran and his wife Janaki shifted to the Connemara Hotel after waters from the raging Adyar river surrounded their Ramavaram Garden house. He took a boat from his house to reach his car parked on higher ground on the Porur Road and then drove to the hotel.

In more recent times, in 2005, torrential rain, caused by a deep depression over the Bay of Bengal, disrupted life in Chennai and northern Tamil Nadu in October. At least 50,000 people were shifted to relief centres, as houses in several low-level areas were submerged. The rainstorm in northern Tamil Nadu came just as the Cauvery districts were slowly recovering from the heavy flooding that followed huge inflows into the river from Karnataka.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe
440,440,mumbai,2014,https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/27/mumbai-flood-rain-monsoon-city-planning,27 Nov 2014,Mumbai will likely flood again – and nobody's doing much about it,"Any discussion of floods in Mumbai begins with a ritual invocation of one fateful date: 26 July 2005. On this day, the megacity received 944mm of rainfall – the average amount for the entire season, and a 100-year high. This, combined with high tides, set off a devastating flood in the city, much of which is built on low-lying land reclaimed in the 19th century. In the catastrophe that ensued, electricity, water supply, communication networks and public transportation were totally shut down; 1,493 people perished, more than 14,000 homes were destroyed, and the city incurred losses amounting to £1.2bn.

In response, in 2007, the municipality formulated the Greater Mumbai disaster management action plan, which identified the risks and vulnerabilities the city could face, including floods, earthquakes and cyclones; it also formed the Disaster Management Cell to co-ordinate relief and rescue efforts, and widened and deepened the Mithi River, which drains into the Arabian Sea. But environmentalists and researchers contend that too many factors which make Mumbai vulnerable to flooding remain: unabated construction on floodplains and coastal areas, as well as the continuing problem of storm-water drains and waterways being clogged by plastic garbage.

Much still remains to be done, but time is running out. Climate scientists predict that chances of a 2005-like flood could more than double in Mumbai by 2080, and the losses could triple. “We need preventive measures, rather than a Disaster Management Cell, when we know [flooding] is an extreme event we’re prone to,” says Rishi Aggarwal, an environmental activist involved in urban planning and mangrove conservation. “But we have not learned anything in 10 years. For the past year, I’ve been involved in the development plan for Greater Mumbai, and there is no discussion on land use, like flood-prone areas where construction should be avoided.”

Last October, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) portended an increase in rainfall, heat, humidity and sea-level rise that led them to rate Mumbai as the second most at-risk city among 50 worldwide, according to risk consultancy Maplecroft’s climate change vulnerability index. “Although the development of new drainage infrastructure in the city is underway,” the report noted, “the project is behind schedule and over-budget, demonstrating that the implementation of adaptive measures may still be a challenge for the local government.”

The report observed that unchecked development would also expose more people and assets to the ravages of climate change. “Currently, 2.8 million inhabitants in Mumbai are exposed to coastal flooding, but this figure projected to increase to 11 million by 2070, with exposed assets growing from $46.2bn to $1.6tn in the same period.” The report also added that certain actions, like indiscriminate clearing of mangrove forests, had escalated the city’s flood risk and lead to a three-fold increase in run-off.

The majority of deaths in the 2005 flood occurred in informal settlements, which are home to more than half of Mumbai’s population. “Slum-dwellers occupying low-lying precarious land are the most vulnerable to environmental stresses and flooding events,” says urban geographer Colin McFarlane, who has studied water and sanitation issues in the worst-hit slums towards the west and east of the city. “But what was striking to me was that there was a triple injustice enacted upon them: first, the flooding circulated rubbish and human waste around the slum, leading to outbreaks of malaria, dengue, leptospirosis, and general ill health since people had less access to food, water, medicine, and healthcare, and emergency services neglected these areas, focusing on middle-class neighbourhoods. Second, compensation was offered in a haphazard way – for example, it could often only be accessed through people who had the right sorts of contacts. Lastly, slums are often blamed for the actual flooding, and that can enter into justifications for demolition.” With climate change increasing the risks of these disasters, and squeezing finite resources, McFarlane fears that these triple injustices will only deepen.

Some of the worst-hit regions in 2005 lay along the Mithi River, a waterway clogged by silt, plastic and sewage that runs through the thickly populated and industrial areas of the city before draining into the Arabian Sea. In 2004, Rakesh Kumar, chief scientist at the Mumbai-based National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, had released a report that predicted these areas would be badly affected in the event of a flood. “There were, and still are, two reasons for this vulnerability,” Kumar says. “First, heavy rainfall events are increasing in frequency every year, which is attributed to climate change. Second, our infrastructure in terms of stormwater drains and natural drains like wetlands are being constricted and getting encroached upon.” Some of the flooded areas were on new developments along the riverbanks, atop mangrove forests that had once slowed the approach of seawater and could absorb excess water. “We’ve been saying wetlands and mangroves need to be looked at as vital infrastructure of the city, like a water or sewage treatment plant, something that will prevent disasters.”

Since 2013, Narayanan Vasudevan, the head of Mumbai’s Mangrove Cell and a marine biologist by training, has been charged with managing and protecting 5,469 hectares of this vital natural infrastructure in Mumbai and the suburban reaches of Navi Mumbai. Sophisticated satellite mapping has made the task easier by identifying the location and extent of mangrove ecosystems now designated as protected forestland. But it also reveals how frustratingly futile the task can be in a land-hungry megacity, by constantly throwing up glimpses of parking lots, temples and garbage dumps popping up where mangroves used to be. “Half the mangroves are on private land,” says Vasudevan, “so we have no control over them. Also, Mumbai is a developing city, and all the debris from buildings being knocked down needs to go somewhere.”

The problem is that these debris dumps lay the ground for illegal reclamation of land, in flagrant violation of a law restricting construction on coastal areas. Earlier this year, a few environmental groups had brought a number of these violations to the Bombay High Court’s attention, and the court directed Vasudevan to visit the site. The violations he recorded in his report included shrinking lakes and wetlands, as well as reclaimed land upon which parking lots, temples, slums and even a road had been constructed. In the report, Vasudevan notes: “[Some] areas are witnessing destruction of coastal wetlands at a feverish pitch through incessant dumping of debris. Several new apartment complexes have cropped up, indicating the seriousness of the threat from real estate developers.”

Stalin Dayanand from Vanashakti, an environmental group that petitioned at the High Court, thinks that nothing will change so long as affordable housing is not constructed for migrants, who crowd into low-lying areas near deltas and on sinking coasts, and so long as the developer-politician nexus continues. He accuses politicians and local administrators of “regularising environmental violations by builders”, and of stalling the release of a contour map that would demarcate high-tide zones where construction would be hazardous. “The map was submitted six months ago, they’re not going to let it get through to the public until it’s pointless, and there are multi-storeyed monsters everywhere,” he says.

“This year, the tide breached the Gateway of India. It’s a wake-up call. But you can wake up someone only if they’re sleeping, not if they’re pretending to sleep. The Corporation is too busy making money to notice.”",issue,2005 Mumbai floods,"Mumbai, India",26 July 2005,28 July 2005,Mumbai,944mm,£1.2bn,"1,493","14,000 homes were destroyed","The 2005 Mumbai floods were a devastating flood event that occurred in Mumbai, India.

New Delhi, September 10, 2014: As Jammu and Kashmir continues to reel under its worst floods in 60 years, which have stranded over 6 lakh people and killed about 200, the attention is slowly veering towards the reasons and causes behind this unprecedented natural disaster. An analysis by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) suggests that this could very well be another manifestation of an extreme weather event – induced by a changing climate.

“The Kashmir floods are a grim reminder that climate change is now hitting India harder. In the last 10 years, several extreme rainfall events have rocked the country, and this is the latest calamity in that series,” said Chandra Bhushan, CSE deputy director general and the head of its climate change team.

CSE researchers have compiled a list of such extreme events – these include the Mumbai floods of 2005, the Leh cloudburst of 2010 and the Uttarakhand floods of 2013. In each of these disasters, thousands have died and the economic losses incurred have run into thousands of crores of rupees.

As was the case with some of the previous extreme rainfall events, the scale of disaster in J&K has been exacerbated by unplanned development – especially on the riverbanks. In the last 100 years, more than 50 per cent of the lakes, ponds and wetlands of Srinagar have been encroached upon for constructing buildings and roads. The banks of the Jhelum river have been taken over in a similar manner, vastly reducing the river’s drainage capacity. Naturally, these areas have suffered the most.

The tragedy in J&K, says Chandra Bhushan, is that the state has not been prepared to handle such extreme rainfall events. In fact, J&K does not have a flood forecasting system. Its disaster management system is also rudimentary.

The climate connect

Heavy and very heavy rainfall events in India has increased over the past 50-60 years. A study done by B. N. Goswami of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, shows that between 1950 and 2000, the incidence of heavy rainfall events (> 100 mm/day) and very heavy events (>150 mm/day) have increased and moderate events (5-100 mm/day) have decreased.

Most climate models also predict that India will be hit more and more by extreme rainfall events as the world continues to warm in the coming decades.

According to the latest analysis by the Working Group II of the IPCC Assessment Report (AR5), floods and droughts are likely to increase in India. India will get more rainfall but in lesser number of rainy days. Increase in extreme precipitation during monsoons is also predicted.

The IPCC’s 2011 Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation – abbreviated as the SREX report – presents projections for the period 2071-2100. It points to increasing incidents of more frequent and intense heavy precipitation over most regions.

What, then, should India do? Sunita Narain, director general of CSE, says: To begin with, the Indian government must discard its ostrich-like policy and get out of its denial mode. We will have to see the linkages between climate change and the events such as those unfolding in J&K. We will have to accept that climate change is going to affect us more and more in the future. We will, therefore, have to start preparing to adapt to the changing climate.”

India should start internalising climate change adaptation in all developmental policies and programme. From building of cities infrastructure to agriculture and from water supply to energy infrastructure, we will have make changes to incorporate climate change impacts, says Narain.

Chandra Bhushan adds: “India will also have to proactively work with other countries to reduce emissions to control the warming of the planet. Most studies show that India is one of the most vulnerable countries. A warmer planet will affect India severely – and its poor would be the worst impacted.”

They realised she was one of the thousands of survivors of the floods that ravaged Kashmir the previous month. But what really surprised them was the five-year-old’s answer when asked where she was from — Bandra in Mumbai, and separated from her parents for over a year.

Today, Megha is living with the Sheikhs, like their own daughter, hours away from reuniting with her family which has been traced in a slum. And giving a sinister twist to this story is the clear indication that she may have been a victim of child-trafficking.

“She is missing her family,” said Dilshada Bano, wife of Abdul Rashid Sheikh, adding that she has taken care of Megha like her own daughter Nifya. “During the initial days, she refused to eat food but now she is better. We are treating her like a family member,” she added.

To keep Megha occupied and happy, the Sheikhs have even taught her how to play games on Nifya’s iPad. But what has worried the family and police are Megha’s replies to questions about how she reached Kashmir.

Sitting with Nifya inside Sheikh’s home, Megha told The Indian Express in Hindi that she was brought to Kashmir on a train by a person she called Nazir who “took me to Sopore, Ashmuqam and Anantnag where he would beg for money from people.” \”He even cut my hair,” she said.

“He (Nazir) kidnaps small children from Mumbai. I went to Uttar Pradesh, Nizamuddin in Delhi, Jammu and then Kashmir,” she said, adding that Nazir didn’t give her food for days. Recalling her days in Mumbai, Megha said that her father “used to beat my mother after drinking alcohol.” “I miss my mother so much and I want to go back to my home now,” she said.

The Sheikhs initially informed the local Nehru Park police station about the child. “They told us to visit the Ram Munshi Bagh police station. But there, they refused to accept the child, saying that this station is only meant for women,” Dilshada Bano said.

Masood Rashid, Station House Officer (SHO) at Nehru Park, said that it was they who alerted police in Mumbai.

According to Rakesh Maria, Police Commissioner, Mumbai, “We got the information (from police in Srinagar) and the missing persons bureau was put into action. In two hours, the details were matched. The family lives in Nirmal Nagar and had registered her as missing a year ago. The family is now being taken to Kashmir by our team which will ensure they are reunited with the child.”

According to Vasant Dhoble, ACP in Mumbai police’s Missing Persons Bureau, they found at least 13 Meghas initially and the search was narrowed down only because the child could remember where she lived. “Nirmal Nagar is a huge slum pocket. We sent teams to track her hut and they showed people prints of her photograph doing the rounds in social media. They confirmed the identity of the girl,” said Dhoble.

Police records have identified Megha’s father as Shardaprasad Chaudhury and her mother as Seema. According to them, Megha was walking with her mother when she asked Seema to get her something to eat from a roadside eatery. “Her mother paid for the food and had begun walking. When she turned back after a minute, the child was gone. This was in June 2013.”

In fact, it was a member of the Sheikh family, Parvaiz, a tour operator, who first posted Megha’s photo on Facebook.

Bashir Ahmad, Abdul Rashid Sheikh’s brother, said that the family is doing everything to keep Megha happy. “In the evenings when we watch the news, she comes and wants to switch the channel to Cartoon Network. We immediately change the channel so that she can watch the Doremon cartoons,” he said.

”She is just like my daughter and my only worry is that she should reach her parents,” Bano said. And till that happens, Megha seems happy where she is. “Aunty (Bano) is treating her like her own daughter and tries to keep me happy all the time. They give me chocolates too, I am happy here.”

Scorecard

It would have made perfect sense had the Jammu & Kashmir players charged from the sidelines once Obaid Haroon called Hardeep Singh for the winning single. Or if they had danced in the middle like a team that had just won a World Cup. Or if loud shrieks of joy had burst in the dressing room as the team assembled for a meeting. All would have been appropriate and fitting for the scale of their achievement, for Mumbai had only lost five Ranji matches at the Wankhede in the last 15 years, all of them to major teams.

Instead, the J&K group just got up on the feet, shook each other's hands, embraced, and made a slow approach towards the pitch, as Hardeep took his light blue helmet off after completing the run and raised his bat towards them. They had been sitting by the boundary for a while, anxiously waiting and gorging on bananas, cheering every single without being overtly boisterous. Samiullah Beigh was padded up. He was there too, not inside the dressing room. Still, the muted reaction was quite a contradiction after they had brought a legendary team down on its turf.

The only time it looked like the players were excited was when the news filtered that Sachin Tendulkar was in the Mumbai dressing room and the J&K players, most of whom were in Mumbai for the first time ever, could get a chance to meet him in person. Most of them ran back to the dressing room, waiting for Tendulkar to emerge and greet them. However, they were left a tad disappointed as Tendulkar left after a brief meet-up with their coach, Sunil Joshi, and their media manager. It was a minor low on a day of highs though and this team is pretty good in handling lows.

Parvez Rasool on... How their preparation was affected by floods...

""We lost a month of practice because of floods. The guys prepared themselves mentally after that and made do with practice wherever possible. The guys from Jammu played in Jammu. The guys from Srinagar also moved elsewhere. It's good that even after such adversity, we were able to perform well. We also had a 15-day camp in Nagpur and that helped us all. Our coach's hardwork and experience had an impact on the boys too.""

Losing out on home advantage...

""Every team gets home advantage. Last year we won three out of four of our home matches. This year we don't have a home game, but we will have to manage with whatever we have with us.""

Beating Mumbai in Mumbai...

""We did so well here without much preparation, it's a big thing for us. One thing this proves is that our players have a lot of potential. If they get good facilities and infrastructure, they can grow further.""

In the build-up to the season, the region was ravaged by devastating floods. When other teams were getting their pre-season preparations sorted, a J&K player was attending a funeral of a friend; when players around the country were spending time in gymnasiums, some J&K players were busy clearing up the mess the floods had left behind; when teams would have been planning of their home-match strategies, the J&K players had no clue where their home venue would be. As the water receded, J&K, among the big boys for the first time, realised they didn't have a home advantage to exploit this year. All their games were to be away matches, against Mumbai, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Bengal and others. It's one way to travel around the country, but not the one they would have chosen for sure.

Playing their first match at the Wankhede would have been nerve-wracking, but the team had taken some confidence from the win against a star-studded Delhi in the Vijay Hazare Trophy earlier this season. Their players, including their impressive seamers, had also been part of the zonal teams this year. The team's confidence was also boosted, according to one J&K player, as they saw the grass being shaved off from the pitch once the locals had seen their seam attack. That seam-bowling group did go on to make an impression, picking up 14 wickets on what Parvez Rasool thought was a ""dead"" pitch.

Although J&K suffered a collapse in the first innings, a maiden century from Shubham Khajuria , an India Under-19, had ensured they had the lead - a lead in Mumbai. Beat that for a confidence-booster. So when they came out on the fourth morning with nine wickets in hand, 179 adrift of a historical win, they knew they had the wares to go all the way. An early wicket was lost, a 52-run partnership followed. Another wicket, then another partnership.

Shardul Thakur tested Khajuria and Rasool with a bounce barrage, with his aggressive stares, with his frequent conversations, but then he sprayed it wide down the leg side for four and it signalled a change of momentum. Next over, the 46th, Khajuria whipped two superbly-timed boundaries, against the turn of Vishal Dabholkar, through midwicket. Then Rasool reverse-swept in the same over to pick up four more. But J&K have seen things are never that simple. They had lost five wickets for one run in the first innings; today they lost both set batsmen at the same score. Khajuria chipped one back to Iqbal Abdulla and Rasool was bowled round his legs by Dabholkar.

Waseem Raza joined Hardeep ahead of Haroon and Beigh, a surprise move that seemed to have added hesitation among the batsmen rather than trouble the opposition. Twice, the two batsmen argued after completing ill-advised singles. There was hesitation a third time too, but Raza, going for a second, was well short of a throw from third man. However, the two had added a vital 44.

There is nothing that gives as much relief to the batting team, and annoys the bowlers at the same time, as an outside edge. Hardeep got one through the vacant first slip off Thakur. Once that gap was plugged, Haroon got another through second slip off the same bowler. Those two edges had a finality to them; there were no more jitters and J&K strolled through, Hardeep playing a dogged hand of 41*.

""Hardeep is a senior player. He won a game last year as well, against Goa,"" Rasool said after the win. ""We were expecting him to draw from his experience and deliver for us. Shubham [Khajuria] played a tremendous innings. He has played India Under-19 and scored 160-odd at that level. We brought him from that level because we needed someone at the top. He has had a good impact since his arrival.

""Beating Mumbai in Mumbai is a big thing. But our graph has been going up for the last three years.

The World Bank has ranked Mumbai as one of the most vulnerable cities to sea level rise in the world – fifth in terms of overall cost of damage and seventh in terms of damage measured as percentage of GDP.

The horrors of July 26, 2005 still haunt us every time there are predictions of heavy rainfall. Flash floods and landslides occur, in some capacity, every year during the monsoons. The floods, stagnant water and untreated surface runoff catalyse the spread of diseases, deterioration of ground water quality generating negative perceptions of these vulnerable urban spaces.

In response, the municipal government expands its budget to install larger storm water pipes and constructs new sewage treatment plants. However, there are no attempts made to address the root cause behind these issues – ineffective top-down government regulations with general public apathy as a by-product. To better address these causes, one must first analyse the city’s morphology.

Mumbai, from being an archipelago of seven islands with wetlands between them, was consolidated, first by the British and then by the Indian government into one large land mass. The city grew northwards and employment centres were set up together with housing complexes, which in turn attracted informal communities to encroach nearby.

Parallel to this growth, government organisations set up infrastructure and created spatial strategies for development in order to streamline the way for entrepreneurial agencies to populate the market. In search of this market oriented goal, naturally existing systems (mangrove forests, wetlands, rivers) were ignored, and at many places erased. The consolidation of islands resulted in most of the wetlands being sacrificed thereby, causing a shift in balance – urban development replacing nature. The mangrove forests, rivers, and wetland systems that protected the coastal suburbs from high monsoon tides and floods were compromised.

Despite the municipality constructing concrete roads and building storm water drains, lack of maintenance and unchecked growth of formal and informal developments blocked these drains with solid waste. To add to this, deforesting wetlands made the city vulnerable to tidal surge, causing storm water drains to overflow back into the city during high tide.

In addition to issues of flooding, the sea level around Mumbai is projected to rise by 48cm by 2100, which, along with tidal and storm surge, could have devastating impact on the coast. There have been an insubstantial number of studies carried out on this issue. A Google search reveals some newspaper articles mentioning the possibility of sea level rise, and a general technical report from the National Institute of Oceanography in Goa.

However, thanks to public protests due to frequent floods, the remaining mangroves and wetlands have been placed under protection of the forest department and strict regulations have been set against their deforestation. Most or all the mangrove forests are now located along coastal edges of Mumbai. They have been pushed out, and rivers have been squeezed in, leaving Mumbai vulnerable to tidal waves, floods, erosions and sea level rise.

Deeper examination suggests the urban corridors of Mumbai’s river emerge as one of the greatest potentials to not only address issues of flooding, but also create a liveable and symbiotic urban environment. Mumbai’s rivers are seasonal and begin in the catchment areas in the hills of Borivali National Park, and flow via wetlands – Dahisar in the north, Oshiwara towards the west, Poisar in the centre and Mithi in the southern part of Mumbai – into the Arabian Sea.

To illustrate one framework to address many of these issues, the Oshiwara River’s urban corridor is chosen. It shows these symptoms as empirical evidence of larger issues – river water and the bed are polluted due to point and non-point source pollution from the watershed. Regular floods during monsoons in the watershed due to storm water pipe outlets getting choked by garbage in addition to change in depth of riverbed caused by excess sedimentation. And negative perception among people who live in or pass by this watershed due to the foul stench and inaesthetic River edge.

The root causes of these symptoms are attributed to government policies and their ambiguous definitions of urban rivers: for example, the fact finding committee’s report on the Mumbai floods calls Oshiwara River a ‘nalla’ while listing places for improving storm water drains, and it becomes a ‘river’ when describing the flooded areas. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), on its website, lists three major nallas for P South ward, Oshiwara River being one of them.

The term ‘nalla’ brings images of polluted, smelly, mosquito infested open drains. Thus, when the government itself refers to rivers as nallas, it is no surprise residents perceive and treat the river as an open drain. Furthermore, despite specifying areas under Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ), there is no readily available information or maps illustrating this. Thus, this leads to multiple interpretations of developable land forcing the municipality to only be able to react retroactively.

Residences set back sufficiently or build tall compound walls to avoid direct view.

The untreated waste accumulates and settles down as a form of sedimentation. This affects natural flow of the river and adversely impacts the stream’s water carrying capacity causing overflow and flooding during heavy rains and high tides.

Untreated surface runoff and storm water is released directly into the river.

Bridges going across the river lack any pedestrian infrastructure and are not properly maintained by the municipality.

Furthermore, a multi-layered top-down structure complicates the process of implementation and maintenance of regulations and policies. Physical infrastructure in Mumbai is operated and maintained by the MCGM’s Storm Water Department. At the state level, it is the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority that lays down measures to protect and improve the quality of coastal environment, and prevent, abate and control environmental pollution along the coast. At the national level, the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) sets out general guidelines for conserving the nation’s natural resources.

Meanwhile, residents and laypersons are completely unaware of the existence of these regulations. The only time they become aware is when they are charged an additional Rs 6 per square foot while purchasing an apartment within the CRZ. This lack of awareness of ecological issues when coupled with extra payment furthers the negative perception towards natural systems, especially nallas … er rivers.

The way forward lies in seeking ways to address these root causes. Spreading awareness of ecological benefits that urban rivers provide, among all residents of formal and informal housing types, is probably one of the most important first steps. This can be done through informational leaflets, public exhibitions, and popular media like movies and newspapers. Additionally, surveys should be administered to learn about people’s perceptions of their neighbourhoods and of the river itself. These can help planners learn about and learn from local knowledge, in order to focus on future policies.

Subsequently, a decentralised approach could be proposed where residents themselves are given control of managing all rainfall that falls on their property – through rain water harvesting, surface runoff treatment and detention basins. This can take care of the load on both the municipal infrastructure and Oshiwara river, thereby prevent backflow during high tides. Through such inclusive approaches and trusting local knowledge there is tremendous scope for more innovation in water treatment and management.

Here, the government should be facilitator and mediator, ensuring that processes are all inclusive. There should also be transparency in the planning stages especially for cross departmental collaboration – storm water management, road transport, sewerage, and housing departments. Decentralising the process would help cut through red tape and give more teeth to the municipality. The blanket CRZ norms could be modified as per local conditions based on topography, hydrology and watershed. This could be used as an incentive for developers to use best management practices for water treatment and management within their properties.

The government also has the potential to set a precedent for the rest of the city. Most of the land south of Oshiwara River between Link Road and SV Road is zoned as Special Planned Area and owned by the MMRDA. They have plans to create an Oshiwara Business District here. However, the Sea Level Rise Explorer map suggests that a major part of this area would be under water by 2050 and most of the rest of it by 2100. MMRDA could use this as an opportunity to propose sea level rise resilient designs through surrender strategies, and building a combination of horizontal and vertical levees by planting wetlands and mangrove forests along the river’s edge.

Following the decentralised approach could potentially pave way for a watershed based zoning, where land use is determined by land form and natural resources, rather than the current method of Euclidean zoning (similar land uses grouped close to each other regardless of physical conditions). Here, the water gets collected and treated through multiple ways:

i.) Rain falling on terraces can be captured via vegetated roofs. This will not only reduce the volume of rainwater coming down, but also treat it. Water from here will be collected in rainwater storing tanks located near the building’s underground water supply tank.

ii.) Combined flow through planters (bio-retention planters) along sidewalks will help capture and treat surface runoffs.

iii.) Detention ponds in residential blocks will help capture, treat and store temporarily water from surface runoff within the demarcated neighbourhood block (proposed sub-watersheds).

iv.) Sub-surface flow wetland systems along edge of the river could collect surface runoff in addition to the treated water from detention ponds of neighbourhood blocks abutting it. This will prevent effluents and harmful pollutants from entering the river.

In order to convert this concept into a realistic proposal, the river’s watershed can be further divided into 28 sub-watersheds defined by housing complexes, in addition to topography.

The areas marked in blue are potential locations for detention basins.

This decentralised approach will not only help detain and treat surface runoff water until the tide subsides, and prevent overloading the river, but also help recycle water for non-potable purposes, thus, easing load on water supply infrastructure as well. Additionally, sensitively designing the detention basins, treatment planters, and wetland swales could potentially create a liveable environment in the development corridor.

These intervention ideas could be summarised as:

i.) River and riverfront restoration through an inclusionary approach and modification of (presently) top-down ambiguous policy formulating and regulating process.

ii.) Spreading awareness and influencing perceptions of space about riverine ecosystems and their benefits.

iii.) Improving storm water drainage infrastructure along the development corridor and sea level rise resilient strategies along the development corridor using decentralised approach.

In order to arrive at the best possible interventions these ideas were tested against the following performance criteria: effectiveness, feasibility and equity.

Alternatives Water quality Edge condition Accessibility to River Disaster prevention Flora & Fauna Vitality Total River and riverfront restoration through ‘inclusionary’ approach and modification of (presently) top-down ambiguous policy formulating and regulating process. Potential to improve. Walking paths, children’s playground, festival and event spaces activate the edge. (Based on precedents like Bandra promenade revitaliasation project). The waterfront could be opened up and made more accessible to residents, passersby and the entire city. Innovative designs and techniques can be used. Such as, ripraps and wetlands to break waves and prevent tsunamis in addition to holding on firmly to the soil preventing erosions and landslides. ‘Cleaning up’ of the edge discouraged scavenging birds and instead migratory and other sea birds are seen there now. (Based on precedents like Bandra promenade revitaliasation project). People start using the promenades and waterfronts right from 5 AM up to 2 AM. Most of these are residents, but many are visitors from different parts of the city. It has the potential for economic development of the neighbourhood. . 5/6 – MEDIUM HIGH Spreading awareness and influencing perceptions of space around river ecosystems and their benefits. No direct impact. No direct immediate impact. No direct impact, but expeditions and nature walks might be organized. No direct immediate impact, but authorities might be pressurized to provide information and disaster management plan. No direct impact. No direct impact. 1/6 – LOW Improving storm water drainage infrastructure and sea level rise resilient strategies along the development corridor using decentralized approach. Treated & usable for non-potable purposes. Sub-surface wetland swales – pleasant environment. Detention basins, wetland swales lining the edge make it very accessible to everyone. Detention basins prevent loading the River excessively. At case study sites, floods, erosion and landslides have become a thing of the past. Presence of natural treatment systems create conducive environment for migratory birds and dissuade scavengers. Detention basins could double up as playgrounds during dry months attracting residents. Wetlands, and planters along sidewalk will create a comfortable micro climate for residents and passersby to pause and talk. 6/6 - HIGH

The table above illustrates that a combination of Interventions 1 and 2 would be most effective while Intervention 3 would be the least.

Alternatives Timeline Organizational hurdles Externalities Response from users/ residents Total River and riverfront restoration through ‘inclusionary’ approach and modification of (presently) top-down ambiguous policy formulating and regulating process. Precedent studies (Bandra promenades) suggest approximately 3 years. MCGM, Bandra residents association, police, private funding agency. All worked in unison since this was a resident-initiated program supported by Municipality. (Based on precedents like Bandra promenade revitaliasation project). Unless managed by an unbiased party, it could lead to displacement of informal communities, as residents from housing complexes could throw their weight and over-rule opinions and voices of residents from informal communities. Since it would be a bottom-up approach, it would be the users themselves who would benefit most. 3/4 - HIGH Spreading awareness and influencing perceptions of space around river ecosystems and their benefits. Public exhibitions on this issue that have been organized in the past, took 2-3 years to develop. (Example- Soak & Open Mumbai) Funding agency, organization/ institution/ individual undertaking the awareness drive. Could run short of funds. Shortage of staff to undertake the program. Criticism from architects and planners. Past exhibitions have received very positive response evident in the fact that both, Soak and Open Mumbai, were extended for a significant amount of time. 3/4 - HIGH Improving storm water drainage infrastructure and sea level rise resilient strategies along the development corridor using decentralized approach. Projects elsewhere have been implemented rapidly. In Mumbai, due to presence of so many stakeholders, it is unpredictable. MCGM, SWD, Central Housing Societies and its members, individual home owners, informal settlements, MSRTC, MMRDA. Extensive hydrological, topological, hydraulic research would be required initially before laying the first stone. Cost of procuring plants and other materials. Might require high initial maintenance and operating costs until the plants grow and become self-sustaining. This might invite push-back from residents. Saving and storing water might relieve them from relying on Municipality’s erratic supply, hence positive. 0.5/4 - LOW

Interventions 1 and 2 rank highest in terms of feasibility. However, Intervention 3 appears to be the least feasible. Hence, using parts of interventions 1 and 2 might help creating the impetus needed to kick-start storm water drainage improvement and work towards a more effective solution.

Intervention 3 appears to be the most equitable alternative. Intervention 1 is a close second, however, it does nothing to take care of displaced informal communities. Herein lies one of the greatest discrepancies of this evaluation.

The impact on informal communities is deduced as negative because of the elitist attitude of the public wherein under the pretext of ‘beautification’ informal settlements and encroachments are bulldozed away from the waterfront. In the context of this evaluation it could be argued that this impact is significantly greater than the impact on passersby or the private agencies or businesses – for instance, 3,000 slum dwellers could be evicted and rendered homeless overnight, while 20 people passing by would find the new waterfront attractive and decide to hang out there every day. Would this mean that evicting 3,000 slum dwellers would be same as losing 20 new visitors to the waterfront? Probably not. Hence, due to the absence of an unbiased rationale for designating a hierarchy to the people / agents affected by these interventions, they have all been assumed to be the same, for the purposes of empirical evaluation. However, close attention must and will be paid to who is and who is not affected while recommending policies and implementing interventions.

Analysing the various symptoms of Oshiwara River, scrutinising its issues and proposing various interventions lead to some avenues where new policies or modifications could be recommended to achieve the most effective, feasible and equitable results for the river’s urban corridor:

1.) Distribute survey questionnaires and informational leaflets in areas vulnerable to floods, sea level rise and other natural calamities.

2.) Encourage and subsidise public awareness programs via art and architecture exhibitions.

3.) Strategies and designs to improve storm water drainage infrastructure along the development corridor require to be laid out soon before the entire system collapses leading to large scale disaster.

4.) Promote transparency in the planning stages by encouraging cross-departmental collaboration (storm water management, road transport, sewerage, and housing) and public participation.

5.) Participation of residents and experts is essential during the design development stage to not only spread awareness of the proposal’s benefits, but also provide them ownership of the process.

6.) Decentralised approaches to storm water drainage treatment and management should be undertaken to ease load from existing deteriorating drainage and water supply infrastructures.

7.) Modify existing norms of the CRZs and make them more flexible according to topography, hydrology and watershed of the site. This could be used as an incentive to interested developers to use best management practices for storm water treatment and management.

8.) Set up strict urban river water quality standards and perform regular maintenance and inspections.

9.) Adopt revenue generating mechanisms along the river instead of levying fees to residents.

10.) Revitalising Oshiwara river into a natural amenity like an ecological corridor, to prevent it from getting neglected and instead, benefit residents and communities along the corridor.

Among these recommendations, the need to spread public awareness and involve local populations for making decisions are most essential. Additionally, the importance of improving storm water drainage infrastructure and proposing sea level rise resilient strategies along the urban corridor, illustrate the need to integrate the site’s physiology with land use. Thus, a two pronged approach of upgrading infrastructure sensitively, and utilising local knowledge are most relevant to maximise the potentials provided by the urban corridors of Mumbai’s rivers.

Two persons have been reported to be washed away in floods in Mahasamund and Kanker.Unconfirmed reports claimed that a minor girl was washed away in Mahasamund area. The other case was from Kanker from where a man was washed away in swollen Kotri river. Officials have only confirmed loss of property worth lakh but denied any deaths.With water flowing well above the danger mark in these districts in rivers Sodur, Pari, Jonk, Tale, Indravati and Doodh, flood alerts have been issued for various villages in the vicinity of the river embankments and evacuations carried out in some areas. Gariyaband district administration has already evacuated 86 girls studying at Adivasi Balika Ashram in Pantora village and shifted them to the district headquarter.While the state has so far recorded 422.5 mm of rains since June 1, over 350 mm of downpour has been received in the past 48 hours. With the met department having forecast more rains in the next 24 hours, flood threat exists in districts of Rajnandgaon, Kanker and Balod also.According to Niranjan Das, Gariyaband collector, district's connectivity to the state capital, Raipur, has been cut off with Sodur and Pari rivers being in spate. He said water levels at Sikasar dam had reached dangerous levels, forcing the administration to release over 20,000 cusecs of water on Tuesday morning. Release of water, coupled with heavy downpour and gusty winds, flooded Pari river, which was flowing 2.5 feet above the danger mark since last noon.Electricity supply to major parts of the districts has been affected due to uprooting of supply lines and power poles and almost two lakh people are without electricity. Das said it would take another 12 to 18 hours to restore power supply to the affected areas.Das said the administration might have to release more water from Sikasar dam, as the levels were rising again. He revealed that connectivity to 36 villages, with a population of over 20,000 people, falling on the downstream of Tale river towards Devbhog area had been completely cut off. He said since the villages fall on the border, their connectivity with Odisha was open.Das said about 100 villages in the Churu block were also marooned and their connectivity to Gariyaband district headquarters was cut off.Officials of Mahasamund administration, said the Jonk river, about 40-45 kms from the district headquarters, was flowing almost six feet above danger mark. Waters from swollen Jonk river had flooded the National Highway 353, cutting off connection between Sambalpur and Odisha.He said 250 people were struck at some local area and efforts were on to rescue them. ""We have asked for boats from Raipur and Mahasamund to evacuate stranded villagers,"" he said. According to reports appearing in local evening papers, the minor girl was washed away in Saraipali area. However, officials refused to confirm the same.RP Jain, Commissioner, Bastar division said a 'high alert' had been declared in Kanker district also where the Doodh river was flowing at the danger mark. About 50 villages have so far been affected and road connectivity is cut off between Pakhanjur and Durgkondal due to swollen Pahari river.In Jagdalpur, the Hatguda area has been cut off due to an overflowing Indravati. Water from the river reportedly breached embankments and flooded farms near the banks. Ganpati resort and Satsang Bhawan in the area have been also flooded. Alert has been issued for 24 villages falling on the banks of Indravati.In Narayanpur and Bijapur districts about 100 villages have been affected due to overflowing rain water drains. Flood threat exists in Sukma district also where Sabri river was flowing just below danger level.

An analysis by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said the floods could very well be another manifestation of an extreme weather event induced by a changing climate.

""It is a combination of an intense and unprecedented rainfall event combined with mismanagement (of drainage) and unplanned urbanisation and lack of preparedness,"" Sunita Narain, CSE director general, told reporters.

CSE said, as was the case with some of the previous extreme rainfall events, the scale of disaster in Jammu and Kashmir has been exacerbated by unplanned development, especially on the riverbanks.

""In the last 100 years, more than 50 percent of the lakes, ponds and wetlands of Srinagar have been encroached upon for constructing buildings and roads. The banks of the Jhelum river have been taken over in a similar manner, vastly reducing the river's drainage capacity. Naturally, these areas have suffered the most,"" the CSE said.

Elaborating on the unpreparedness of Jammu and Kashmir in dealing with such events, CSE officials said that Jammu and Kashmir does not have a flood forecasting system and ""its disaster management system is also rudimentary"".

""The Kashmir floods are a grim reminder that climate change is now hitting India harder. In the last 10 years, several extreme rainfall events have rocked the country and this is the latest calamity in that series,"" said Chandra Bhushan, CSE deputy director general.

CSE said its researchers had compiled a list of such extreme events which includes Mumbai floods of 2005, Leh cloudburst of 2010 and the Uttarakhand floods of 2013.

""India should start internalising climate change adaptation in all developmental policies and programme. From building of cities infrastructure to agriculture and from water supply to energy infrastructure, we will have to make changes to incorporate climate change impacts,"" said Narain.

""In each of these disasters, thousands have died and the economic losses incurred have run into thousands of crores of rupees,"" the CSE said.

The CSE analysis about Jammu and Kashmir floods further highlighted that there has been ""unseasonal and extreme rainfall"" and at many places as it rained more than 200-mm in 24 hours –- 400 per cent more than the monthly average.

However, CSE said that in these cases of Leh, Mumbai, Uttarakhand and now Jammu and Kashmir, no mention of climate change was ever made by the Indian Meteorological Department and it has rejected it as the possible reason for the events.

CSE said that Ministry of Environment and Forests & Climate Change too has ""no opinion"" on these extreme rainfall events. The think-tank said heavy and very heavy rainfall events in India has increased over the past 50-60 years.

""A study done by BN Goswami of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology Pune shows that between 1950 and 2000, the incidence of heavy rainfall events (above 100 mm/day) and very heavy events (above 150 mm/day) have increased and moderate events (5-100 mm/day) have decreased.""

""Most climate models also predict that India will be hit more and more by extreme rainfall events as the world continues to warm in the coming decades,"" the CSE said.

It said that according to the latest analysis by the Working Group II of the IPCC Assessment Report (AR5), floods and droughts are likely to increase in India. India will get more rainfall but in lesser number of rainy days. Increase in extreme precipitation during monsoons has also been predicted.

Similarly, IPCC's 2011 Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation presenting projections for the period 2071-2100 points to increasing incidents of more frequent and intense heavy precipitation over most regions.

Stating that ""denial was hurting"" more, CSE urged that its time that the country has to accept that climate change is impacting and they are likely to increase in the future.

CSE also called for improving forecasting and warning systems, build disaster management capabilities at the local and state levels, and invest in research to understand more how climate change is going to affect different areas and aspects.

The south-west monsoon for the year 2014 officially ended on September 30. Overall the monsoon has been a mixed bag with many areas of India having a deficit but some areas having a surplus. In the city of Bangalore we were confronted with heavy rains in September; on one particular day it rained more than 120 mm in a short span of a few hours, causing flooding. This will be the pattern in cities, floods at certain times and shortage of piped water at the same time.

As cities get paved, creating hard impenetrable surfaces, the ability of rainwater to percolate into the soil and thence to the aquifer reduces to almost zero. Surface run-off increases dramatically and can go up by a factor of 9. The garbage-choked drains have to cope with a high intensity of rainfall and substantially increased run-off, not to mention buildings in valleys and low lying areas, causing urban floods. At the root of this phenomenon is lack of planning, and building in the wrong places. Not respecting drainage lines and flood plains exacerbates the situation. What can be done about it?

One remedy is to design and plan for every urban micro-watershed by reducing run-off and increasing infiltration into the soil and aquifers. A recharge well is a good way of doing this.

What is a recharge well? Usually a precast concrete ring lined structure, typically a metre or 1.5 metres in diameter and going to a depth of 3 to 8 metres, a recharge well takes water run-off from rooftops, paved areas and roads, filters it and sends it underground to increase the water table. Unlike a conventional well which taps into the aquifer, the recharge well sends water into the aquifer. By changing the flow of rainwater into the ground it is possible to mitigate the impact of floods.

A well-designed recharge well, depending on the soil profile of a place, can send a million litres of water annually into the ground. By coordinating a given catchment area, the coefficient of runoff and the infiltration rate at a place, appropriate recharge wells can be made and the numbers required can be arrived at. They can be linked to the stormwater drains present and placed within the drains itself.

KALYAN: Many low-lying areas in Kalyan and beyond areas like Ulhasnagar, Badlapur and Bhiwandi have been flooded due to heavy rain for the last 36 hours.On Wednesday morning, around 200 families living close to Waldhuni river in Kalyan were shifted to safer places after water in the river started overflowing.The Kalyan creek is also overflowing due to rain.The situation worsened in Badlapur city, which was cut off from Badlapur village after Ulhas river overflowed and submerged a bridge connecting both the areas.In Bhiwandi too, around 300 families living close to Nadi Naka area were shifted to safer places. Water entered many houses in the area.Due to continuous rain since last night many people living in low-lying areas spent sleepless night as water entered their houses.Residents of Rambaug, Shivaji chowk, Market area, Kala Talao, Shahad in Kalyan and Samrat Ashok Nagar, Panchshil Nagar, Renuka society, Hiraghat and Shanti Nagar area in Ulhasnagar spent sleepless night as water entered their houses.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

An unexpected high tide has left a major portion of Sagar Island flooded, leaving environmentalists worried about its future.Sea water gushed into the island through Muriganga river on July 14, causing extensive damage to crops and destroying homes. Around 10 villages were affected and they continue to be submerged by the untimely rise in water level, which could have been triggered by a change in climate in the region, fear experts.It is usually the shara-sharir baan (neap tide) that hits Sunderbans twice a year — in April and September. But it rarely triggers a flood. This sudden influx of water was not neap tide, say locals and experts. It was much fiercer and struck at least two months ahead of the neap tide, they say.“It could be the result of climate change since the water level has been rising in the Sunderbans. Nothing like this has ever happened in 70 years so people were not ready for it. Paddy cultivation and betel plantations — the main sources of livelihood in the island — have been severely affected. The fields are still under a foot and half of water and salinity has reduced soil fertility. No crop will grow in the flooded villages for at least 2-3 years,” said Sudipta Bhattacharjee of SAFE , an NGO that has been studying the impact of the high-tide.Some of the affected villages were severely damaged by Cyclone Aila in 2010.What worries environmentalists most is the possible trigger. If this wasn’t neap tide, then it could happen yet again next month, they fear. “Since this doesn’t seem to be the neap tide, we are possibly in for another flooding next month. Last month’s flooding might have been the result of rising sea-level, but we are not sure. There could be other environmental factors at work as well. The severity of the flood is indeed worrying and a repeat could be disastrous,” said environmentalist Amalesh Misra who runs the NGO Paribesh Unnayan Parishad (PUP).SAFE and PUP are assessing the impact of the flood and trying to unearth the reason for it. They have already detected a major deterioration in soil condition and loss of biodiversity. “It will now be difficult to grow high-yield varieties of paddy or betel due to the high saline and acid levels in the soil. It may improve slightly if it rains heavily and dilutes the salt. But microorganisms have died out due to the influx of sea water and this has adversely affected soil fertility,” said Bhattacharjee. The water level in the adjacent Buriganga river is now being closely monitored.Locals are bracing for September when the neap tide is expected. “If it doesn’t, then we may conclude that it struck early. But then, we must find it out why it happened,” said Misra. Environmentalist and lead author of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change Joyashree Roy felt this could have been one of the erratic and extreme climatic events that would now be more frequent. “It is the trend worldwide and Sunderbans is particularly vulnerable in terms of climate change. It has been affected by both a rise in water-level and erratic rainfall. Rainfall pattern, in fact, has changed across the country.A sudden flood like the one in Sagar Island is a cause for concern. It is a sure sign of climate change. Events like this can’t be predicted and we are likely to see them more frequently now,” said Roy.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
452,452,mumbai,2014,https://zeenews.india.com/news/sci-tech/mumbai-kolkata-most-vulnerable-to-climate-change-govt_1506992.html,30 Nov 2014,"Mumbai, Kolkata most vulnerable to climate change: Govt","New Delhi: India's populous coastal cities Mumbai and Kolkata are most vulnerable to loss of life and properties due to coastal flooding in the second half of the century, the government has said quoting a UN report ahead of a key global climate conference in Peruvian capital Lima.

The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned against extreme weather events like occurrence of heatwave, heavy precipitation, droughts, floods, cyclones and wildfire that cause damage to ecosystems and human systems in various regions, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said.

""... India is among the top 20 countries and regions most at risk based on analysis of climate risk and coping ability. Mumbai and Kolkata will have the greatest population and assets exposure to coastal flooding in 2070,"" he said.

The minister's statement assumes significance at a time when representatives of governments are scheduled to meet in Lima from tomorrow for the Climate Change Conference to lay the foundation for an effective, new and universal climate change agreement in Paris in 2015.

Last week, the UN Environment Programme had underscored the need for global emissions to peak within the decade and then to rapidly decline so that the world can reach climate neutrality also termed zero net emissions in the second half of the century.

With climate change impacts worsening and affecting the poor and most vulnerable, governments urgently need to scale up adaptation to climate change, according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

""Never before have the risks of climate change been so obvious and the impacts so visible. Never before have we seen such a desire at all levels of society to take climate action,"" said Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of the UN Climate Convention.

Figueres said ""it is hugely encouraging"" that ""countries have already been outlining what they intend to contribute"" towards the climate action, referring to the recent agreement between China and the US to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Climate expert Chandra Bhushan, however, said the deal signed between China and the US ""was not in line with the principals of the UN Convention"". In Lima, India must work harder with developing countries and push for an ambitious global deal which is equitable and saves the world from catastrophic climate impacts, he said.

""India must push for a principle-based emissions reduction target for all countries. This is the only way the world can remain within the planetary limits,"" Bhushan said.

In a statement issued ahead of the Lima meet, Figueres said, ""Never before has the society had all the smart policy and technology resources to curb greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience... We can be confident we will have a productive meeting in Lima, which will lead to an effective outcome in Paris next year.""

The UN has said, in Lima, all governments need to work towards streamlining elements of a draft agreement for Paris 2015 and explore common ground on unresolved issues in order to achieve a balanced, well-structured, coherent draft for the next round of work on the text in February next year.

The governments meeting under the ""Ad Hoc Work Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action"" (ADP) needs to define the scope and the type of contributions they will provide to the Paris agreement, along with clarity on how finance, technology and capacity building will be handled, it says.

Countries will put forward what they plan to contribute to the 2015 agreement in the form of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) by the first quarter of 2015, well in advance of the Paris conference in December.

The Lima conference needs to provide final clarity on what the INDCs need to contain, including for developing countries who are likely to have a range of options from, for example, sector-wide emission curbs to energy intensity goals.

According to Figueres, ""countries are working hard to increase emission reductions before 2020, when the Paris agreement is set to enter into effect. Pathways on how to accomplish this will also be a key issue before nations in Lima.""

Union minister Javadekar will be part of the high-level Indian delegation to the Lima Conference.

In addition to progress made to date towards a Paris agreement, the political will of countries to provide climate finance is increasingly coming to the fore. At a recent pledging conference held in Berlin, Germany, countries made pledges towards the initial capitalisation of the Green Climate Fund totalling nearly USD 9.3 billion.",discussion,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The tamarind tree here that offered sanctuary and saved more than 150 lives during the Musi floods of 1908, would be protected and the past glory of its immediate environs at Afzal Park would be revived, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) Commissioner Somesh Kumar said here on Sunday.

At a meeting organised under the same saviour tree by Centre for Deccan Studies (CDS) and Forum For Better Hyderabad (FBH) to pay homage to the 1908 Musi flood victims, Mr. Somesh Kumar said experts would be roped to restore and maintain the historic tree. The availability of money was not an issue for the civic body, he said.

Responding to pleas to save the Musi, Mr. Somesh Kumar said the task involved departments such as revenue, water board, irrigation and also active involvement on part of the local populace.

“Transforming Musi into a live river and restoring its old glory is a herculean task. However, it can be done and I am hopeful we will do it,” he said.

Towards protecting the city’s heritage, the GHMC has been actively pursuing various works, including the Charminar Pedestrianisation Project and restoration works at the Quli Qutub Shahi Tombs, he said, adding that incentives for protection of heritage structures were also under consideration and orders could be expected soon.

“At least five to six monuments of Hyderabad should be on the UNESCO list but there are none. We need commitment to preserve heritage and maintain them,” the GHMC Commissioner added.

CDS secretary Sajjad Shahid recounted the accounts of havoc caused by the 1908 floods and said the ravaging Musi swept through colonies, destroyed properties and affected thousands of people.

“Hyderabad showed remarkable resilience and rebuilt,” he said, adding that more than 100 years later, the city was still facing similar problems. Mr. Shahid said the tamarind tree needed to be recognised, protected and respected.

FBH president M. Vedakumar called for steps to address issues related to dumping of pollutants and garbage and encroachments to save the Musi.

I have returned from the hell that Srinagar and much of the Kashmir Valley is today. I have returned with my parents only because of the Indian Army and the kindness of strangers. Everything else has collapsed in most of Srinagar.

I went to Srinagar on Saturday alarmed by reports of floods in the Kashmir Valley to reassure my parents who lived there, but not very concerned about their safety. Four generations of Mattoos had lived in our family home, in one of the most pleasant neighbourhoods of Srinagar: Gogji Bagh. My grandfather liked to tell his grandchildren that they should ensure that their spine was as strong as the foundations of our house! It had survived every vicissitude in the ups and downs of the Mattoo family and Kashmir: earthquakes, militancy (a bullet in my great grandfather’s portrait is a reminder of the violent 1990s), deaths and personal grief.

On Saturday evening, there was the first ominous sign: there was a power outage. We slept, however, comforted by the prediction of the local meteorology chief, Sonam Lotus, who has become a popular icon for the accuracy of his forecasts, that Sunday would be sunny. And indeed I woke to a radiant blue sky with not a cloud in sight. But the power outage had continued through the night, and I got a frightened phone call from a neighbour at about 9.30 a.m. that the bund on the bank of the Jhelum (near Lal Ded hospital, about a kilometre from our house) had been breached!

Within minutes the water was streaming ferociously into our garden. I calculated we had about an hour before our ground floor was submerged; actually we had just about 30 minutes.

In that frenzy, we could only really clear the kitchen: food and water to feed a staff of 12 — and moved to the upper storeys. The water had risen one- and-a-half storeys by the afternoon and we stayed up that night maintaining a vigil, not entirely sure what we would do if the water rose to the upper floors: we had no power, no phones (mobile or landline), no contact with anyone, and just a couple of messages that we were not sure had been delivered. The night echoed with cries of ‘bachao bachao’ from the nearby Gujjar and Bakerwal hostel in Amar Singh college and other places!

On Monday morning, we were finally rescued by the brave jawans of the Indian Army in a paddle boat and taken to a safer point at the bund – with just one small bag each.

There was no sign of relief or help.

The only option was to rush to the airport. We did so with the kindness of good Samaritans, and after walking kilometres in waist-deep water. Many who helped had never met us, some were friends from Facebook, including Ashraf Bhat – a distinguished lawyer, who walked with us and dropped us near the airport, young Suhail who helped us find a short cut and helped my parents traverse the wall that led us to a dryer route. And Dr. Khan and Sherwani Sahib for finally dropping us to the airport!

We are back in Delhi’s safety, but deeply concerned about those in the valley who are still marooned. Today, Prime Minister, rescue Kashmir, and Kashmiris will respect you forever!

Even as monsoon rains continued to lash the southern districts, the IAF and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) responded with lightning speed to an SOS from Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam to rescue 10 persons caught in floods in Dindigul district on Tuesday.

The 10 persons, including Varshini (14 years) and Surya (16), who were trapped at Kallipatti village of Oddanchatram taluk, were bailed out to safety by the contingents with assistance from the district administration.

The flood was caused by a heavy rainfall of 20.2 cm in Palani and Kodaikanal on Monday and the consequent breach of Nallathangal Odai and another stream.

Malti and Bhagwati Devi are just two of the thousands of people who have had to abandon their homes to take shelter on an embankment in flood-affected Bihar’s Supaul district. Their main worry, however, is not hunger but the difficulties they face in going through their ablutions unlike men. “Poor women like us face more problems to relieve ourselves when floods force us to flee our villages. It is our fate. No one can imagine this except those like us,” said Bhagwati, in her late 30s, who along with her family have taken shelter on the eastern Kosi embankment.

Malti, in her early 50s and the mother of three young daughters, spoke of her ignominy. “We have no option but to relieve ourselves in the open by closing our eyes and minds to the hell-like situation,” she said.

With major rivers including the Kosi, Gandak, Bagmati and Ganga rising and posing a serious threat, Malti and Bhagwati are two of thousands of women in flood—affected districts in the state living with shame and fighting to relieve themselves. “Flood-hit poor women face more problems than men as more than for food, they have to fight shame and shock to relieve themselves either on the crowded embankment or nearby. There is no other place as there is life—threatening water all around,” said Ranjeev, a flood expert who works in the Kosi region.

Mahender Yadav, an activist working in the same regiion, told IANS: “It is beyond imagination how women trapped by the rising rivers go through their ablutions.”

A much sought—after item by these women is polythene sheets or bags with which they can wrap around themselves and stand in the water to relieve themselves. “Even polythene sheets are in short supply as the authorities have failed to provide them,” Mr. Yadav said.

Ranjeev said neither the men of their families nor the government pay proper attention to this big problem of women in the flood—hit district.

He said that there is no plan to erect makeshift toilets on the embankments for women. “A few years ago, a British woman researcher was with me on a visit to an embankment during floods. She was stunned to know that women have been forced to relieve themselves in the open as there was no arrangement made for them,” Ranjeev recalled.

It is over 10 days that rivers continued to flow above the danger mark in Saharsa, Supaul, Madhepura, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Khagaria, Sitamarhi, Nalanda and other districts, affecting 1.6 million people in more than 850 villages.

Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, after an aerial survey of the flood—affected 15 districts last week said the situation is grim but under control. He ordered the district officials to provide relief and rescue on a priority basis to people living in inundated areas.

The floods have so far claimed 17 lives in the state.

The state government has evacuated 116,000 people till date from flooded areas and around 50,000 people have taken shelter in 133 relief camps set up by the government at different places. The government had earlier sounded a high alert as the water level of major rivers in north Bihar rose following heavy rain in their catchment areas in Nepal.

They were to have cut short response time and introduced new fire stations, but the failure to do these alongside lack of manpower led the fire department of the BMC to struggle with major fire incidents this year, for example at Lotus Park in Andheri, where a fireman lost his life too. Making matters worse, an ex-chief fire officer was demoted too.

3. Incredible but true: Mumbai continues to be the Tuberculosis capital of the world. The government and civic body have not even succeeded in ensuring total reporting of multi-drug resistant TB cases and extensively drug- resistant TB cases in the city, both showing a rising trend. Currently, the city has over 30,000 TB patients.

4. The wetlands of Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane saw an onslaught of debris dumping and landfilling activities this year. A road was cut across a wetland on Thane-Bhiwandi road with mangroves still standing on it. A private mangrove forest was converted into a dumping ground by the Thane civic body and a residential building was constructed on a wetland in Thane.

5. Drug seizures rose mainly on account of the Mumbai Police’s crackdown on Mephadrone that’s not listed under the NDPS Act. With the drug currently a rage among youngsters — it offers speedy weight loss, lowered inhibition levels and the ability to function without sleep for long periods — the Anti-Narcotics Cell has a growing problem to take care of.

6. Try finding a spot to park in Lower Parel on Monday morning at 10, or at Nariman Point, Dadar, Andheri or Malad. The traffic cops conducted a city road audit in February, mapping 200 ‘trouble spots’ where there was haphazard parking causing traffic jams. With an average 1,450 new vehicles plying on Mumbai’s roads daily, this is not a problem that’s going to go away soon.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Environmentalists say last year's devastating flash floods in Uttarakhand, in which at least 5,000 were killed, and the unprecedented deluge in Jammu and Kashmir this year, both have the same cause - urbanization, reduced forest cover and erratic monsoon.Authorities in both states ignored warnings from weathermen, magnifying a disaster waiting to happen.At least 150 have been killed in Jammu and Kashmir, where large parts have been submerged, and tens of thousands are waiting to be rescued.

The meteorological department says it had issued warnings about very heavy rainfall in Jammu and Kashmir practically every day since September 2. But while a few families did move to higher regions, the state government seems to have failed to anticipate the extent of the crisis and effectively convince those who stayed back.The situations in Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir are uncannily similar, experts say. In both cases the trigger was incessant rain, set off by the merging of the western disturbance and the monsoon.In Uttarakhand, the devastation was worse because of deforestation, and construction on the river bed. Houses were built either on or dangerously close to the river banks, which raised the human cost of the disaster. ""It is a similar pattern in parts of J&K also,"" said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment.Monsoon in India has always been tough to predict. And some scientists say that rainfall patterns are getting frequently more erratic. In Srinagar, the average rainfall for September 5 is 0.4 mm. But this year's figure was 49mm - 122 times more.""These events of intense rainfall have been increasing and we will have to learn how to adapt to them. Part of that process is ensuring that we build wisely and in safe areas,"" adds Mr Bhushan.The other form of caution is to pay close attention to weather forecasts and act on time. Done right, it is effective - as was seen during the Cyclone Phailin, which hit the Odisha coast last year.

While New Delhi claims that Kashmir is an inseparable part of India, the government has left flood victims to fend for themselves

An absent state, a militarised zone

Willfully neglected by New Delhi and used by the Indian army as a PR exercise, flood-affected Kashmiris look to their own

By Dilnaz Boga

“Drove across South Kashmir, battered and bruised. Just reached Srinagar, the city in shambles, can smell death in the air KashmirFloods,” writes a Facebooker who is on his way to meet his family in Kashmir almost two weeks after the flood killed 74 in the Valley.

“SOS we needs rafts. Send us rafts from Bombay,” reads a tweet posted by a desperate youth from Downtown Srinagar to a friend outside the Valley.

“Even traffic constables are not on the streets and it is causing havoc on the few roads that are open for ferrying relief supplies,” complains another social media user.

The absence of the state is at the heart of the calamity that Kashmiris have been facing. The “rescue effort” in a region considered to be one of the most highly militarised zones in the world is shocking indeed.

“They (security forces) had lists when they came to rescue people in our neighbourhood. They had been instructed to rescue government officials and Pandits, not local Muslims. They were sticking to the list,” claims an agitated young man while speaking over the phone from Rajbaugh, an affluent area where bureaucrats reside.

“They flew so low that our boat overturned! Then the soldiers dumped biscuits and expired medicines in the filthy floodwater. How can we use these?” asks an angry flood survivor from south Kashmir.

Structural violence has been woven into the state’s rescue plan in Kashmir. The apparent tactic of ignoring the masses in India’s only Muslim majority state and selectively rescuing Indian tourists and bureaucrats has elicited condemnation from Kashmiri civil society all over the world.

Instead of streamlining aid distribution to make it easier for aid agencies, sources revealed that the state has made it mandatory for aid agencies to procure permission from the local SP in order to release relief packages at the cargo distribution point at Srinagar airport.

“This will not only delay our effort, but also involve paperwork. At a time like this, should we run around asking for permission from police?” asked an agitated camp coordinator.

“The administration, without taking our views into account, has also asked us to keep our trucks outside the gate of the airport as it is a high security zone. Are we supposed to walk for a kilometre out of the airport with relief material on our heads?” he added. No official communication has been released to this but relief workers in different parts of Srinagar claim this measure is very much in place.

Manipulation of channels of aid to state-sponsored NGOs and selective meting out of relief material like blankets, disinfectants, medicines and inflatable rafts to certain sections by the government has magnified the alienation felt by the Kashmiris, who have endured over two decades of unbridled state terror.

In an article titled, ‘In J&K floods, army only thought Indian citizens needed help’, on September 19, 2014, Lt. General D.S. Hooda told The Times of India (Mumbai edition) that 30,000 troops were directly participating in the rescue efforts.

Aware of the damage the flood had caused, he stated, “Water supply was hit, electricity was cut, hospitals went under water and communication systems were totally down.” Dismissing the notion that stone-pelters had targeted troops, choppers and boats, Hooda stated that out of the “thousands of boats deployed by the army, there were only one or two incidents of stone-pelting”.

Commenting on the skewed coverage by the Indian news channels on how the army has saved lives, a Kashmiri doctor settled in Europe says, “This has got to be the largest psychological operation by the establishment through the Indian media; if they show the lies often enough, people will believe them. Meanwhile, reports on Indian tourists being saved by the security forces highlight the fact that tourists and bureaucrats were the only ones on the government’s mandate.”

In the name of embedded journalism, Indian television channels chose to focus on the army’s rescue operations in selected locations in Jammu and Kashmir. But photographs from international new agencies told a completely different story — a story that the Indian news channels deliberately ignored. Scores of Kashmiri youth took to the streets in a bid to rescue citizens from different areas of Kashmir, with the army nowhere in sight.

Sikhs, Pandits and Muslims saved each other after days of being stranded in their semi-submerged homes. “Even the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) was ignored by the army. Some of them were stranded without a raft and we fed them,” said a relief worker in downtown Srinagar. “Relief supplies were not sent to areas where there were 30 people stuck in one house in places like Bemina, which are still submerged,” said another aid worker.

With hardly any help from the state, local journalists and youth from mohalla committees have come to the aid of people caught in harrowing circumstances. Even as aid pours in from different parts of the sub-continent, a young volunteer from Srinagar expresses concern about winter. “It is fast approaching. Look how cold the water is. It’s difficult to stand in it even for five minutes,” he says.

Freny Manecksha, a Mumbai-based journalist who was caught in the flood, recounts, “I didn’t see rescue efforts by the army near the Kashmir University in Nigeen, at Rainawari or Khanyar in Downtown. At the relief camp, I heard they rescued people in the Rajbaugh area and at G. B. Pant Hospital. Mainly, it was the mohalla committees that helped the locals. Also, there was a lot of anxiety as people weren’t in touch with one another due to a breakdown in communication. There was no police control room information either.”

In the first few days of the calamity, locals had realised that mainly tourists would be rescued. The troops normally deployed on the streets of Srinagar were nowhere to be found. “They were very angry with the Indian media and were cursing the chief minister. What they said about the chief minister can’t be printed,” Manecksha adds.

Around 1,800km away, Kashmiri students in Mumbai joined hands to help their loved ones back at home. An engineering student says, “Our institution has not backed us, but we can’t sit around doing nothing. I haven’t heard from my family but I know there will be a need for medicines and blankets as Kashmiris have lost everything, so we are doing whatever is in our capacity.”

Kashmiris across the country and even abroad have answered the call for help from the Valley. To prevent an epidemic, a Kashmiri doctor settled abroad has uploaded a document on risk and disease prevention during floods in English and Urdu to be distributed at relief camps.

@NaqKash is one of the many Twitter handles that liaised between those at the grassroots level and those who want to be part of the rescue efforts. In fact, flood rescue groups on Facebook and Twitter managed to connect some of the rescuers to those stranded in their attics for over seven days.

Messages of scarcity of fresh drinking water have prompted Kashmiris from Delhi and Mumbai to look up fresh water springs in the nearby areas and post their locations. Lists of required medicines are uploaded from the flood-hit areas, numbers of those needing rescue exchanged and maps of functional routes updated and disseminated to streamline the relief operations.

In an effort to raise funds and collect essentials, some students outside the Valley have gone out of their way to co-ordinate with those in need despite the communication lines being down for over a week. “In some areas, the network is slowly coming back to life, but even that is intermittent,” says a relief worker from a camp closest to the airport.

But trolls and anti-Kashmir elements on Facebook have infiltrated some of the rescue groups and recommended that people use certain chemicals, which are in fact poisonous, to disinfect their homes and localities. Politicising the calamity, trolls on social forums have praised the efficiency of the army and resorted to abusing the Kashmiri separatists while ridiculing Kashmir’s call for self-determination.

Journalist for the local paper Greater Kashmir, Majid Maqbool, wrote “Our tragedy, nature’s fury in this case, was turned into a spectacle by the news channels, a shameless PR exercise to boost the image of army in Kashmir. The subsequent ‘relief and rescue operations’ in Kashmir thus became an image makeover opportunity for the army that was ably supported by all the news channels that were willing to come onboard. However, it must be pointed out here that almost all the Kashmir-based correspondents and video journalists despite themselves being at the receiving end of floods and some of them not knowing the whereabouts of their own families, deserve all the appreciation for covering the plight of flood hit people across Kashmir.”

Kashmiris have always known that to Delhi, the disputed territory is an “integral part of India” and that its abysmal human rights record shows that the Kashmiri people have never mattered through six decades of protracted struggle.

Aala Fazili, a relief co-ordinator at Humhama camp, a kilometre away from the airport, concludes that the Centre has actually behaved the way a coloniser or occupier behaves when humanitarian disasters afflict their subjects. “They have shown a cold response, and undermined and underestimated the picture they have projected through its media to the world. After 20 days, there’s no presence of Indian institutions here.”

Interpreting the government’s response to the calamity, Fazili further explains, “The Centre has issued an unofficial order on airlifting of only government aid from Delhi airport. So, every thing donated by NGOs is stuck. Thus they want to control the incoming relief and are for cibly making people accept only what they want to give them. The state propaganda through Indian media had been deflated, so now they want to exhaust us all so that people have no choice but to use government aid, something they had been refusing all this time. Delhi has used this calamity as a mechanism of controlling the people.”

Wards of death

In Srinagar, a house of healing became a house of horror the day the flood waters rushed in. Ignored by state rescuers, trapped patients and staff endured three days of hell

By Sheikh Saaliq

Somewhere in Sonwar, Srinagar, at the G.B. Pant Hospital in Srinagar, little children aged not more than 10 years and newborns, many of whom were restricted to their hospital beds, were battling for life as the floods hit Srinagar. There was much cacophony outside: people trapped in their houses and even on the rooftops of mosques waved frantically to helicopters hovering above for help. But once the flood water sped in, the only thing outsiders could hear were wails and cries. Minutes after, the G.B. Pant Hospital in Srinagar was afloat with dead children.

It has been 10 days since the Jhelum broke loose, destroying everything which came in its way. Within minutes, almost all of Srinagar was submerged. As most of the city recovers from the havoc created by the floods, people are slowly returning to their homes to flush out the remaining water and filth from their bedrooms and kitchens. But G.B. Hospital in Sonwar offers a haunted look. Nobody is there.

The reception area, where once doctors used to keep the inventory of the people going in, has been abandoned. In fact, all of the hospital is now desolate. Its corridors, once populated with patients, doctors, nurses and peons, remain empty.

The smell of medicines has been replaced by the nauseating stench of grit left behind by the flood waters.

In Srinagar, a house of healing became a house of horror the day the flood waters rushed in. Ignored by state rescuers, trapped patients and staff endured three days of hell

The halls, corridors and rooms of G.B Pant Hospital in Srinagar wear an eerie look, bearing mute testimony to the catastrophe that has just passed. The reception counter is still abandoned, the machinery in disrepair, and the beds almost unusable — photos by the writer

The hospital beds are still connected with glucose bottles and the wires are still left dangling, dripping with muddy water.

The flood water which rose up to the second floor of this hospital, has left brown marks all over the walls. Under the ceilings, medicine drenched with flood water — tablets, syringes and syrups, once meant for children, poke out from the mud filled inside the rooms. Outside, only water can be seen. And the make-shift ropes made from hospital curtains, which are left hanging from the first and second floor windows of the hospitals, from which patients evacuated.

Inside, Mohammad Ayoub, one of the caretakers of the hospital is cleaning the floors. His lowers folded up to his thighs, Ayoub sweeps the mud water from one corridor to another — his eyes wandering across the hospital walls. “This is the place where I have spent most of my life. Now it lays abandoned, as if cursed by witchcraft,” laments Ayoub.

He was inside the waiting room when water crashed through the hospital gates. Hearing a loud thud, he swiftly left to check what had happened. It was three in the morning. “It took me a few seconds to peep out of the window to see what was going on, and within those few seconds, I could feel my feet under water.”

It took me a few seconds to peep out of the window to see what was going on, and within those few seconds, I could feel my feet under water.

Wading though knee deep water, Ayoub, his fellow caretakers and some people accompanying the patients started to evacuate the building. But the force of the water flooding in was such that no one could pass through it; nobody could leave.

“It was impossible to leave the building. The water was coming inside very fast. It felt like as if I was in a mountain stream. The only smart thing to do at that time was to take the patients to the upper floors. But it was too late,” Ayoub says.

Haji Ghulam Mohammad Mir remembers the cries of the people who were trapped inside the hospital. His house, just in the backyard of the hospital, is still deeply submerged in water. He says that he felt helpless at that time.

“I couldn’t do anything. My family and I went for safer grounds. The farther we went, the fainter the shrieks of the children were getting. I just couldn’t do anything to help the drowning children,” Mohammad says.

Once the terrified people started to move to the upper floors, the water had risen drastically. Almost all of the first floor was under water. The hospital beds were touching the ceiling and those who managed to escape found themselves on the first floor. Many children were safely moved up the stairs but the worst was yet to happen. A power cut turned everything dark.

A nurse who was on duty at the time recounts the incident as the worst nightmare of her life. Patients who were on life support had yet to be moved upstairs safely, she says. “We couldn’t see anything. All we could hear were cries for help. It was mayhem and we knew death was upon us. I could barely breathe and somehow managed to take one kid in my arms and moved him to the first floor. After that I just couldn’t go back and save more lives,” the nurse said, who herself was rescued after three days by local volunteers.

Many children died that day in the hospital. However, no one knows the exact count. Mehraj-ud-din of Batamaloo was with his two sons in the hospital. Once he helped his two sons to safety, he himself saw dead bodies floating. “Children did die that day, but I don’t know many. I myself closed eyes of three children. Later on, their bodies were taken to Badambagh morgue, where their families took them along for burial,” said Mehraj-ud-din, who had come to recover his blankets and tiffin boxes from the hospital. However, he could find nothing. Everything inside that was there before the floods had been washed away. Some of it lies buried in the rubble.

The people inside the hospital were saved after three long days. All calls for help and evacuation were left unanswered. The only thing people could feed on were ORS packets and glucose. The hospital canteen had already been washed away.

Ghulam Haider, who was inside the hospital at the time of flood, recounts the incident. “The ordeal of the people who were stranded inside can be gauged by an incident when a person had nothing to eat for three days and he started to eat rotten food which was almost completely decayed,” says Haider.

Finally, it was the local volunteers who came to the rescue of the trapped. The water was still up to the first floor and people needed to be evacuated by boats.

The state’s inefficiency in rescuing people in time has angered locals; people inside the hospital and from its surrounding areas confirm that there was a complete ‘failure’ from the side of the state. “State apparatus was nowhere. People could have been rescued at the earliest if the state had swung into action at the proper time. But they didn’t do anything,” says Krishan Singh Bedi, who lives just behind the hospital.

Ishfaq, a 22-year-old, had been rescuing people for almost two days. Once he came to know about the hospital being under water, he along with his friends came to evacuate the trapped people. The scenes he saw were enough to leave him shocked. People had made ropes from the curtains of the hospitals and were coming out from the windows into the water which was at least 14 feet high.

“I couldn’t believe my eyes. People were jumping into the water in desperate attempts to leave. We rowed over to the main gate of the hospital, which was under water, and rescued people in boats. It was horrific,” Ishfaq says. That day, he and his fellow volunteers rescued almost 100 people in their make-shifts boats.

Those who could be evacuated were taken out safely and moved to higher ground in the local relief camps. But the horror inside the hospital the day the water rushed in is something which the Medical Superintendent of the hospital will never forget.

“I don’t know how many children died that day. There was no time to keep count. But I buried children with my own bare hands,” he says.

A game of perceptions

While the historical antagonist plays Good Samaritan, forced dependency in flood relief threatens to push Kashmiri victims to survivor’s guilt and suicide

By Dilnaz Boga

“How can the oppressor let the oppressed be helped?” asked a Facebook user in India-held Kashmir, which has endured the worst floods in over a century.

“Humanitarianism is always loaded with multiple meanings: when employed during a calamity in a conflict zone, it becomes even more problematic due to the urgency of the situation. It tends to overshadow the larger politics which the media is trying to overshadow yet again through its public relations exercise, even as it seeks to influence public opinion through its own agenda of denial, disinformation and delegitimisation,” wrote another Facebook user from Delhi.

The creation of forced dependency by the Indian state on relief material for the flood affected in Kashmir will have serious mental health repercussions on those who have borne the brunt of state terror, warn doctors based in Srinagar.

In a bid to ensure that locals are prevented from availing aid provided by civil NGOs, the government has unofficially asked relief seekers to produce permission from the police for the release of relief packages from Srinagar airport.

Monopolisation of aid has ensured that people of the valley end up solely depending on the state and its structures.

Absurdities reached new zeniths when an offer by the United Nations to intervene on humanitarian basis was also struck down by New Delhi.

With the recent aid blockade, psychiatrists warn that propaganda by the Indian media, portraying the army as the saviours of the valley’s inhabitants “is bound to cause some cognitive dissonance in a population which is already grappling with the effect of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to living in one of the most highly militarised zones in the world.”

In psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental stress or discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time, or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas or values.

Some people might feel survivors’ guilt for accepting aid from the same army which was responsible for the death of a family member or even their own torture in the past. They will feel guilty, as they have survived because of killers.

In the first fortnight after the deluge, quick action from community workers, Kashmiri groups outside the valley and pro-freedom leaders through their extensive networks, filled the lacuna that grew from absence of state participation in rescue efforts.

Simultaneously, as standard political PR exercise, political parties affiliated with the state whipped up propaganda about their successful intervention in the disturbed region. Two weeks after the deluge, members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) flew to Srinagar with aid from Delhi. Interestingly, J&K doesn’t even feature in the flood advisory of the Central Water Commission.

With power being used by the Centre to exacerbate the bleak situation, the condition on the ground is getting worse with winter looming. In the Sumbal area and around Wullar, the situation is such that people chase aid trucks for about 2km simply to get water, discloses a resident. Ironically, aid is being sent by local politicians to Kupwara, which has been unaffected — all this for votes, exclaims a youth. Sources also reveal that the police on the outskirts of Srinagar stopped a truck full of relief material from Aligarh Muslim University and confiscated its contents, sending them to a government godown.

“So far, the majority has survived due to community effort by resistance leaders and not because of government intervention,” explains an aid worker from a camp in central Kashmir, who also complained about tonnes of relief material being sent back to Mumbai and Delhi from Srinagar by the authorities, this week.

“This restructuring of rules regarding aid release at the airport 15 days after the flood signifies another oppressive tactic. The state not only wants to exhaust the indigenous political groups that are working on the ground of the supplies they have, but also render them irrelevant in this time of crisis.

“The state wants to control the narrative in the media about what a great job they are doing by controlling the flow of aid and proving that Kashmiris are availing aid from India and that they should feel grateful,” says the aid worker.

A doctor who has already noticed some changes in people’s attitudes around him remarks, “It’s not just cognitive dissonance in Kashmir, but also outside the valley, where people’s ability to reason, modify or accommodate their initial observation of the army will change after they accept aid from them. Clearly, this is a part of a psychological operation to improve the image of the armed forces in Kashmir, because so far, the people have abstained from taking any help from the government, either through state-sponsored NGOs or the armed forces.”

Expecting the problem to blow out of proportion, he explains, “With relief channels being strategically blocked, people have no choice but to depend on state channels. People have already started making exceptions in their perceptions of the security forces. The vilification campaign against the pro-freedom leaders in the Indian media is a part of the same psy-op to change the minds of Kashmiris about the international dispute,” he says.

This cognitive dissonance in people, doctors say, might lead to a higher suicide rate. A psychiatrist elucidates, “Some people might feel survivors’ guilt for accepting aid from the same army which was responsible for the death of a family member or even their own torture in the past. They will feel guilty, as they have survived because of killers. This will lead to a higher suicide rate. These survivors should be told not to blame themselves. For example, it’s not you, it’s the situation that demands this kind of response and that it is in fact help from an agency that is in charge of the response.”

Counsellors, to bring people out of survivor’s guilt, can also use hypothetical situations. For example, a patient may be told: “An Indian goes to China and an earthquake occurs. The PLA comes to his rescue. After helping him, the PLA asks the survivor to record a video saying that the army is great for rescuing him and that India should now handover Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh to them. Is it logical to expect this argument?”

Survivors need to be told that helping someone doesn’t mean you believe in their political ideas, another doctor added. “All this should be done at a wider level as part of the daily sermons or counselling sessions.”

464,464,mumbai,2014,https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2014/04/uttarakhands-furious-himalayan-flood-bury-indias-hydropower-program/,2 Apr 2014,Uttarakhand’s Furious Himalayan Flood Could Bury India’s Hydropower Program,"Despite the inherent risks, India is determined to join China, Bhutan, Nepal, and Pakistan in turning the Himalayas into the Saudi Arabia of hydroelectric energy. Almost 300 big hydropower projects are under construction or proposed for India’s five Himalayan states, according to the Central Electric Authority.

“The government wants to put dams on every river in the Himalayas”

The most turbulent stretches of many Himalayan rivers are scheduled to support five or six new dams, one every 10 kilometers or so. That’s more utility-scale installations than are planned for the world’s other new hydropower production zones – the Rocky Mountains in British Columbia, the Amazon Basin, and the Andes mountains, according to assessments by power authorities in those regions.

“The government wants to put dams on every river in the Himalayas,” said Prakash Nautiyal, a fisheries biologist and for decades a professor of zoology at the Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in this Alaknanda River city of 150,000 residents. “You know the car culture of Delhi and Mumbai? Bumper to bumper. That’s what they want to do in the Himalayas with dams. Bumper to bumper.”



The Himalayas are still forming, still rising – producing one of the most active earthquake zones in the world. The fierce drenchings from annual summer monsoons erupt in regular flash floods that undermine the soils of vertical slopes, cause monstrous landslides, and episodically lay waste to big stretches of the region’s serpentine one-way-in, one-way-out highways. In a typical year, dozens of people drown, are buried, or swept away by floods in India’s Himalayan states.

Technically Complex and Hazardous Challenge

The unavoidable challenge that India’s engineers and contractors recognized but largely ignored, according to a flurry of government and university studies dating to the early 1990s, was whether the truculent mountain range would accept such intensive industrial intrusion. Late last spring, at the start of the heaviest monsoon season in memory, the Himalayas answered that question.

On June 16 and June 17, 2013, the mountains unleashed two days of monstrous floods that killed about 6,000 people, according to estimates from the Uttarakhand government. Survivors and researchers at the Wadia Institute for Himalayan Geology put the death toll at 30,000. Some 800 battered bodies were recovered and 5,200 others were declared missing.

The flooding wiped away at least six villages, buried dozens of others in mud, wrecked over 1,000 kilometers of highways, and dumped hundreds of buildings into the furious waters.

Flood’s Effects on Dam Construction

The June flood also may have drowned India’s long campaign to diversify its energy production with big Himalayan hydropower projects.

In the first of three articles for “Choke Point: India,” an investigation of global energy, water, and farm production trends conducted in collaboration with the Wilson Center, Circle of Blue documents that the flood seriously damaged at least 10 big hydro projects in operation and under construction in Uttarakhand. Another 19 small hydropower projects that generate under 25 megawatts were destroyed.

The findings are based on Circle of Blue’s field reporting in December and January, state and national media dispatches, independent news services, and trade journal notices. We were assisted by the South Asia Network on Dams and Rivers, a non-profit advocacy group, and reports posted on Down to Earth, an online New Delhi-based environmental news site affiliated with the Center for Science and Environment.

The Central and state government authorities, and private dam developers, have said next to nothing about the extent of the damage in news releases, on their web sites, or in public statements. Repeated efforts by Circle of Blue to reach business executives and government regulators by email and phone calls were ignored. The information blackout is so sweeping that even the website of the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, the state-owned hydropower builder and operator, had until recently been offline for months.

The most heavily damaged projects, according to Circle of Blue’s findings, include:

The 400-megawatt Vishnuprayag Hydroelectric Project, upriver from Srinagar along the Alaknanda River, was buried beneath 20 meters of rubble that also filled its water storage lake and likely wrecked the mouth of the penstock, the pipe that transports water to the powerhouse downstream.

A second dam under construction on the Mandakini River, the 76-megawatt Phata-Byung Hydroelectric Project, washed away.

The 400-megawatt Vishnuprayag Hydroelectric Project was buried beneath 20 meters of rubble The 99-megawatt Singoli-Bhatwari Hydroelectric Project downstream on the Mandakini, a major tributary of the Alaknanda, was so aggressively pummeled by boulders that big chunks of concrete were gouged out of its base and the patches of steel reinforcing rods of two support towers were bent like broken wheat.

The powerhouse and turbines of the 330-megawatt Alaknanda Hydro Power Project in Srinagar were inundated with mud and silt just weeks before it was scheduled to begin operating.

A landslide blocked the end of the water discharge tunnel at the 280-megawatt Dhauliganga project near the border with Nepal. The plug caused a backup that submerged the entire turbine room constructed deep inside the hill near the dam, causing at least $50 million in damage and a shutdown that has still not ended, said dam operators.

The Uttarakhand flood surprised India with its fury. Energy authorities in Asia and in North America have said the flood caused the most damage to a nation’s hydropower infrastructure since 1975, when rains from a typhoon overwhelmed the Banqiao Dam and 61 smaller dams in central China, killing 171,000 people.

In the history of energy disasters, the Uttarakhand flood struck the global hydropower industry with the same force that the reactor meltdowns at Three Mile Island (U.S. 1979), Chernobyl (Soviet Union, 1986), and Fukushima (Japan, 2011) battered the nuclear power sector.

“The disaster is a costly wake-up call,” said Peter Bosshard, the policy director at International Rivers, a California-based non-profit research and river protection group that primarily operates in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. “It shows that nature will strike back if we disregard the ecological limits of fragile regions like the Himalayas through reckless dam building and other infrastructure development. We can only expect such disasters to happen more frequently under a changing climate.”

Court Intervention

India’s Supreme Court reached essentially the same conclusion. Last August 13, eight weeks after the flood, two Supreme Court judges, ruling in a case involving the 330-megawatt Alaknanda Hydro Power Project, issued an order that indefinitely prohibited the Central and state governments from granting any more permits for hydroelectric projects in Uttarakhand. The order essentially shut down new hydropower development in India’s 27th state.

“We are very much concerned about the mushrooming of a large number of hydroelectric projects in Uttarakhand and its impact on the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi river basins,” wrote Justices K.S. Radhakrishnan and Dipak Misra. “Various studies also indicate that in the upper Ganga area, there are large and small hydropower projects. The cumulative impact of those project components like dams, tunnels, blasting, muck disposal, mining, deforestation, etc. on the ecosystem has yet to be scientifically examined.”

The Supreme Court’s intervention also came with a directive to the Ministry of Environment and Forests, the principal regulatory agency, to form a special commission to study the safety and merits of continuing with constructing dams in India’s most important hydropower state.

The commission, appointed last year, is unlikely to issue its conclusions until after the national election results are announced in mid-May. Those findings, and their implementation, also are likely to be overseen by the National Green Tribunal, a four-year-old panel of senior jurists that rules on India’s big environmental cases.

In August, two weeks after the Supreme Court order, the Tribunal said it would hear a case involving flood damage that citizens here in Srinagar said was amplified by the Alaknanda hydropower dam. The Tribunal also is monitoring repairs and construction at the damaged Vishnuprayag dam. The Tribunal’s presence is a clear indication that its jurists will closely follow other legal and regulatory aspects of the disaster.

Surly Mountains

In December and January, the dry season in Uttarakhand, the Alaknanda and Mandakini Rivers were clear and blue with no angry crest at all. Yet both rivers, and several more affected by the June flood, reflected the grimness of what happened and the strain of what could easily happen again later this year.

The road transport network has not been fully repaired. Transportation is so difficult, newspapers reported in December, that 1,200 tons of food could not be distributed and rotted in place. Hundreds of people are homeless.

India’s leaders are determined to harness the power of water

The gathering danger is not close to being lifted from Uttarakhand’s magnificent and hardened Himalayan valleys. So much silt and mud and boulders washed off the hillsides during the June 2013 flood that they filled the riverbeds. The rivers of the Alaknanda and Bhaghirati basin run now on new bottoms that are much higher – in some places 30 to 75 meters higher than they were before the flood, according to estimates by residents and the Geological Survey of India.

Unless that rubble is removed, which amounts to a monumental and costly excavation project and has not started, the approaching monsoon season could easily overflow riverbanks and cause more flood damage to dams and communities this summer.

India’s political leaders are determined to harness the power of water flowing down these steep mountain gorges. India estimates its hydropower generating capacity is 150,000 megawatts, more than all nations but China, Brazil, and Canada. Most of the new capacity was planned for the world’s tallest and most dangerous mountains range. But hydro generating capacity, now just over 40,000 megawatts or 14 percent of the country’s total electrical generating capacity, is growing little more than 1,000 megawatts annually, according to the Central Electric Authority.

At that rate, it will take India a century to reach its hydro generating goal.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has attached all flats in Shubhada and Sukhada buildings in central Mumbai's upscale Worli locality, both VIP housing societies, over non-payment of property tax bills from the year 2006. The civic body served notices of attachment of property to the buildings' housing societies on Thursday. Only last year, a handful of flats in these buildings had been served notices for illegal extensions and alterations to their properties.

According to data provided by the Assessor and Collector department of the BMC, the total outstanding property tax dues from Shubhada society is Rs 11.94 crore while Sukhada society is yet to pay up Rs 4.42 crore, sums incurred from April 2006 to March 2014.

Top political leaders from Maharashtra own homes in these two buildings, including deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, BJP leader Gopinath Munde, Punjab governor Shivraj Patil Chakurkar, Maharashtra state Congress president Manikrao Thakare, Maharashtra ministers Patangrao Kadam, Anil Deshmukh and several others.

The civic body initiated the process of attachment in January 2014 following the societies' failure to pay property tax bills. The total outstanding amount of property tax of both the societies is around Rs 16.36 crore.

""Since both societies have failed to pay the outstanding bills in time, we initiated the legal process and attached these two societies,"" said a senior civic official from the assessor and collector department that issues property tax bills.

The official added that following several notices, Shubhada society's management has paid Rs 2.5 crore in June 2013. ""Even then, its outstanding amount is Rs 11.94 crore now,"" said a senior civic official. Now, both societies have been given 21 days' time to pay the outstanding bills. The attachment notice sent to the societies says the properties would be sold unless the outstanding dues, ""with all costs of recovery"", are paid to the municipal corporation's office within 21 days from the date of issue of the notice.

The official added that the societies would be allowed to pay 50 per cent of the outstanding bill to prevent any further action in the matter. ""If they still fail to pay at least 50 per cent amount of the total outstanding bill within 21 days, then we will have to initiate the process to auction these properties,"" explained the official.

Ranjit Deshmukh, Congress leader and chairman of Shubhada society said he was not aware of the attachment tnotice. ""I am not in Mumbai and will check with the society office.""

In April 2013, the civic body had issued notices to Pawar, Munde, Shivraj Patil, Thakre, Kadam and Anil Deshmukh, among others, under the Maharashtra Region and Town Planning (MRTP) Act for allegedly carrying out unauthorized constructions in their flats.

The information regarding the MRTP violations emerged following complaints from RTI activist Amit Maru.

The leaders had reportedly built illegal extensions, converted shops allotted to them into offices and even one gymnasium and had carried out unauthorised alterations inside the properties.

However, the civic body continues to drag its feet in taking action against these politicians. A dispute erupted between two departments of the BMC - building proposals department and the local administrative ward office - over jurisdiction in taking further action in the matter. Subsequently, an opinion was sought from the civic body's legal department in November 2013, which stated that the ward-level office should initiate action against the offenders.

Following that, fresh inspections of the properties were ordered. ""The fresh inspections are being carried out to ascertain the unauthorized alterations and change of user. After completion, we will decide on further course of action,"" said a senior civic official.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
466,466,mumbai,2014,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/indian-food-delivery-service-envy-fedex-n156291,15 Jul 2014,This Indian Food Delivery Service Is the Envy of FedEx,"MUMBAI — In Lower Manhattan, a busy banker stuffs herself with overly rich restaurant fare ordered off Seamless.com. In Frankfurt, a manager slops generous portions of the canteen’s stew onto his lunch plate.

In Mumbai, an insurance analyst sits down to a healthy home-cooked meal, still warm from the stove where it was prepared by his wife or mother.

India’s commercial capital is a teeming metropolis of nearly 20 million, boasting a sparkling international air terminal and a sleek new metro system, swanky furniture stores and Bollywood starlets. It's a city constantly striving, yearning for the future.

Remarkably, its age-old tradition of home-cooked meals — delivered on wheels — has resisted the momentum of change.

The dabbawalas, as they’re known, are the men who make it possible.

They have cemented their place in Mumbai’s colorful tapestry. They deliver lunch from home to the office or school every day, monsoon or shine.

Some 5,000 dabbawalas dole out over 200,000 meals a day, picking up the tiffins in the morning from women, typically, who have packed steaming, spicy dishes into each compartment: a curry, vegetables, dal (lentils), and flatbread (with some variations). DIVYAKANT SOLANKI / EPA

“We take great pride in ensuring delivery even against great odds: We worked through the floods in 2005 and the terrorist attack on Mumbai in November 2008 when most of the city had come to a standstill,” said Vitthal Sawant, a 34-year-old dabbawala who has delivered lunches for more than 15 years.

The dabbawalas are a common sight in Mumbai: men clad in white kurtas, weaving their bikes through impossible traffic and swarming throngs, juggling multiple tiffins — circular silver tins with four to five compartments, each packed with food — that are destined for office buildings and school courtyards.

Transporting lunches may sound simple but what the dabbawalas do every day is a remarkable feat — one so impressive, in fact, that professors from Harvard Business School have traveled to India to study it. Some 5,000 men dole out over 200,000 meals a day, picking up the tiffins in the morning from women, typically, who have packed steaming, spicy dishes into each compartment: a curry, vegetables, dal (lentils), and flatbread (with some variations).

For many Mumbai residents, this is the only way to lunch — on a feast, made with the love of a mother or wife.

“We take great pride in ensuring delivery even against great odds: We worked through the floods in 2005 and the terrorist attack on Mumbai in November 2008 when most of the city had come to a standstill""

""It's expensive to eat outside every day, besides it's not healthy,” said 36-year-old Naina Bhonsle in Mumbai’s Versova neighborhood. “I know what my husband likes eating, and so I prefer to send him a tiffin every day.”

The dabbawalas sort the various lunches according to where they came from, and where they are intended to go, labeling each tiffin with an alpha numeric code. The tins are then loaded onto city trains, transported through the city’s maze and handed off to local dabbawalas who complete the last leg of the route.

At lunchtime, the sharp aromas of turmeric, cumin and chili fill the office as workers deftly mop up their curries with bread. After the food is eaten and the tiffins packed back in their bags, the dabbawalas return the boxes to their respective homes, their loads a bit lighter.

“It’s hard work, no doubt about it,” said Pawan Agarwal, who heads an association called The Mumbai Dabbawala, noting that the crates of tiffins often weigh 100 lbs or more. “But they feel that serving food is serving God so they feel happy to do this business.”

Adding to the physical demands and challenge of precision, the large majority of the dabbawalas are semi-literate or illiterate, mostly hailing from small villages near the city of Pune in Maharashtra state. Their trade first started 125 years ago, in much simpler times. But as Mumbai has grown and transformed rapidly, adding new districts and train lines, the dabbawalas have adapted.

“Even though many of us are only semi-literate, we have learned to read the code,” said Vitthal Sawant. “We don’t have any need for computers — the code is imprinted in our minds.”

“A hundred things can go wrong along the way — tiffins delivered to the wrong destination, tiffins lost, tiffins broken — but they rarely do...Our motto is ‘error is horror.’”

So deeply imprinted that the dabbawalas rarely, if ever, make a mistake. Their delivery system has been awarded a six sigma level of efficiency. That means they make around one mistake in every six million deliveries.

“A hundred things can go wrong along the way — tiffins delivered to the wrong destination, tiffins lost, tiffins broken — but they rarely do,” said Sawant. “Our motto is ‘error is horror.’”

Their delivery system has garnered international fame as a highly specialized trade, attracting Prince Charles and Richard Branson and warranting a case-study at Harvard Business School, visits from global delivery giant FedEx, and a series of documentaries.

The dabbawalas' lore even spawned a critically-acclaimed movie last year. In ""The Lunchbox,"" a mistaken dabbawala delivery sparks an unlikely romance between a young housewife and an office worker nearing retirement.

“My dabba went to someone else, someone else liked it and finished it,” the astonished housewife tells her neighbor as the mistake dawns on her.

“But they never deliver it wrong, that’s impossible!” goes the response.

A Mumbai metro train runs on the first day of commencing operations on June 8, 2014. The first phase of the metro covers a distance of 7 miles and is expected to carry about 1,100,000 passengers every day, but the dabbawalas will not be allowed to use the metro. Rafiq Maqbool / AP

Still, the dabbawalas are facing unprecedented hurdles in a rapidly changing Mumbai. The brand new Navi Mumbai Metro, a much-anticipated rapid transit system, went online in early June, but the dabbawalas will not be allowed to use the new infrastructure.

But with only 12 stations covering around 7 kilometers of the city right now, the metro has little use at the moment for the dabbawalas, and its wagons are too small, says Gangaram Talekar, general secretary of the Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers Association.

“It will not be possible to carry hundreds of tiffins into those compartments, I imagine it will be a huge inconvenience to other passengers as well,” said Talekar. “Of course, we too would like to travel in greater comfort but we are not going to appeal this decision right now because for the moment, it’s impractical.”

“Many people in this city prefer their lunch fresh, prepared lovingly by their wives or mothers...This is why despite so many restaurants cropping up all over the city, our business still sees a 5-10 percent growth each year.”

The biggest challenges, says Pawan Agarwal, are cultural ones, like changing family roles. As women shed their aprons and head to their own workplaces, nobody is left behind to cook lunch at home. His solution is to have the dabbawalas’ wives take over the cooking, closing the catering circle.

“The customers will take cooked food also if husband and wife are working,” he said.

Others have lamented the growing taste for Western standards, for business lunches and quick fast food fixes. Yet the dabbawalas say nothing, not even McDonald's, has managed to put a dent in their business.

“Many people in this city prefer their lunch fresh, prepared lovingly by their wives or mothers,” said Vitthal Sawant. “This is why despite so many restaurants cropping up all over the city, our business still sees a 5-10 percent growth each year.”

What’s more, the dabbawalas are part of the city’s identity, says Agarwal.

“Mumbai is recognized, identified by the dabbawalas — all over India, all over the world they feel proud,” he said. “They are learning from this business, the values, the culture.”

“India irrigates its deserts and dumps extra water on Pakistan without any warning,"" the bearded Saeed told Reuters, as he surveyed a vast expanse of muddy water from a rescue boat just outside the central city of Multan.

“If we don’t stop India now, Pakistan will continue to face this danger.""

His comments will surprise few in India, where Saeed is suspected of helping mastermind the 2008 Mumbai massacre which killed 166 people, a few of them Americans. Saeed, who also has a $10 million US bounty on his head, denies involvement.

But his presence in the flood-hit area is part of a push by Pakistani Islamists, militants and organisations linked to them to fill the vacuum left by struggling local authorities and turn people against a neighbour long viewed with deep mistrust.

Water is an emotive issue in Pakistan, whose rapidly rising population depends on snow-fed Himalayan rivers for everything from drinking water to agriculture.

Many Pakistanis believe that rival India uses its upstream dams to manipulate how much water flows down to Pakistani wheat and cotton fields, with some describing it as a “water bomb"" designed to weaken its neighbour.

There is no evidence to prove that, and India has long dismissed such accusations as nonsense. Experts say this month’s floods were caused by the sheer volume of rainfall.

In fact, some Pakistanis accuse their own government of failing to invest in dams and other infrastructure needed to regulate water levels through wet and dry seasons.

But others agree with the narrative pushed by Saeed and Syed Salahuddin, head of the militant anti-Indian Hizbul Mujahideen group and also one of India’s most wanted men.

“India wants to turn Pakistan into an arid desert,"" Salahuddin told Reuters in a telephone interview, describing another scenario feared by some Pakistanis—that India will cut off supplies of water in times of shortage.

“If this continues, a new Jihad will begin. Our fighters and all of Pakistan’s fighters are ready to avenge Indian brutality in whatever form.""

Charity brings food, ideology

Saeed’s charity, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), has sent hundreds of workers to areas of Pakistan worst affected by the floods, where they distribute food and medicine at the same time as spreading the organisation’s hardline ideology against India.

JuD is believed by many experts to be a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the militant group which India says carried out the Mumbai attack. Saeed was a co-founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba, but he has played down his links to the group in recent years.

“This is a premeditated plan by India to make Pakistan suffer,"" Abdur Rauf, who has worked as a JuD volunteer for 16 years, told Reuters, as he prepared to distribute medicine and syringes at a relief camp near Multan.

“Don’t be fooled. This water bomb is no different from the atom bomb. It’s worse.""

Officials in India’s water resources ministry this week declined to respond to charges of “water terrorism"", saying they were being stoked by militants, not the Pakistani government.

The Kashmir floods have been termed as the worst in the region for more than a century, and officials have put the death toll there at more than 200.

However, in a country rife with conspiracy theories, large numbers of Pakistanis buy into the idea of sabotage.

“This is not a mistake: this is a deliberate act to destroy Pakistan and make its people suffer,"" said Syed Ali, a farmer, as he looked forlornly at the murky waters covering his village of Sher Shah in central Pakistan.

Disagreement over how to share the waters of the Indus river, which flows from India into Pakistan, has dogged the nuclear-armed rivals since independence in 1947.

The neighbours have fought two of their three wars over the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir and observers are worried that the next conflict could be over water.

Claims are ‘downright absurd’

The lives of more than two million people were affected by this month’s floods in Pakistan, and more than 300 were killed.

Some are critical of their own government, saying the mass devastation caused by the latest floods was a result of Pakistan’s own inefficiencies.

“Some people will say India released the waters,"" Yousaf Raza Gillani, a former Pakistani prime minister, told Reuters.

“But my question is: even if there was a timely warning from India that this was about to happen, would we have heeded it? Would this government have taken the right steps? I doubt it.""

Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistan ambassador to the US and now a director at the Hudson Institute in Washington DC, said that water issues are being exploited to keep relations between the two countries tense.

“The Pakistani militants’ claims about floods in Pakistan being the result of India releasing torrents of water are downright absurd,"" he said.

“It is part of propaganda rooted in the belief that Pakistanis must be made to see India as their permanent enemy. Blaming India also covers up for Pakistan’s own failure in water management.""

Climate change

Disputes over water-sharing are a global phenomenon, stoked by rapidly growing populations and increasingly unpredictable climate patterns. In South Asia, home to a fifth of humanity, the problem is particularly acute.

“Regional flooding in South Asia is certainly linked to climate change effects. In recent years there has been major glacial recession on Pakistani mountains, and monsoon rains have been unusually and even unprecedentedly intense,"" said Michael Kugelman at the Woodrow Wilson International Centre.

“At the same time, I’d argue that ... human-made actions are making things even worse. Deforestation in Pakistan, for example, has caused floodwaters to rage even more,"" he said.

The region’s three major rivers—the Indus, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra—sustain both countries’ breadbasket states and many of their major cities, including New Delhi and Islamabad.

In Pakistan, agriculture contributes to about a quarter of its gross domestic product (GDP), and the country still relies on a network of irrigation canals built by the British.

Hoping to resolve the issue once and for all, the two countries signed the Indus Water Treaty in 1960, but India’s ambitious irrigation plans and construction of thousands of upstream dams continued to irk Pakistan.

India says its use of upstream water is strictly in line with the 1960 agreement.

According to a 2012 Indian government report, the country operates 4,846 dams in the region.

“We can’t blame India for our own mistakes,"" said Malik Abdul Ghaffar Dogar, the ruling party lawmaker from Multan.

“We turn every dam project into a political deadlock and a stick to beat our political opponents with, but the truth is this country needs dams and it’s just not building any."" Reuters

At least 24 engineering college students from Hyderabad were feared washed away in river Beas in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh late on Sunday evening.

The students were reportedly washed away by the flash floods that occurred in the river after water was released from the upstream Larji Hydro electric project. The engineering students who had entered the river bank on the Mandi-Manali highway were apparently taking photographs at Thalot.

The sudden surge of water swept away at least 18 boys and 6 girls of VNR Institute of Engineering and Technology catching them completely unaware. The college is located in Bachupally on the outskirts of Hyderabad.

There were 61 tourists, including 48 students of the engineering college, who were travelling to the hill station of Manali. Out of 24 missing students, 6 were girls, police said.

The local administration said the gates at Pandoh dam in Mandi, about 15 kms downstream, have been shut to fish out the bodies. The vehicular traffic on the busy Mandi-Manali highway has also been closed to conduct the rescue operations.

The students were on an industrial tour and left Hyderabad on June 3. One of the students, Pratyusha who saved herself said that they were on their way to Kullu from Shimla and they were taking pictures on the river bed. Some students went a bit deep into the waters and they couldn’t rush back as the gushing waters swept them away.

“The project officials had sounded an alert but we did not hear it,” she said sobbing uncontrollably seeking the help of the media to bring them back. “There has been no assistance so far from the HP authorities except for the police grilling us about the number of students,” she lamented.

Andhra Pradesh Resident Commissioner Shashank Goel said that information given by the Mandi Deputy Commissioner Dwesh Kumar said: “The Deputy Commissioner has not confirmed any casualties.”

Himachal Pradesh officials said that the students who were feared washed away could surface in Pandoh dam, which is 15 kms downstream of the site of the tragedy. “Himachal Pradesh officials have requisitioned the services of divers and rafts to take up relief and rescue operations,” Mr. Goel said adding that a two-member team of AP Bhavan – P.Ravin Shankar (Assistant Commissioner) and M. V. S. Rama Rao (Protocol Officer) are leaving by the first flight to Kullu, which has an airport.

In the last 25 years, India has witnessed hundreds such incidents killing thousands of people. But we yet fail to learn anything from these past incidents. Every year in India, especially in the mountain regions like Himalayas, landslides damage and destroy many houses, and cause millions of rupees damage to buildings, roads, railways, pipelines, agricultural land and crops.

According to research done by the Defence Terrain Research Laboratory, “Landslides rank third in terms of number of deaths due to natural disasters. While, Himalayan Landslides kill one person per 100km. The estimated average losses due to landslides in the Himalayas costs 200 lives and Rs 550 crore every year. Whereas, The hazard affects over 0.49 million km, over 15 % of our country's area.”

After the 1998 Malpa tragedy that killed 200 pilgrims of Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, widespread awareness of the problem was created. The Disaster Management Act, 2005, (December 23, 2005) was passed by the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India, on 28 November, and by the Lok Sabha, the lower house, on 12 December 2005. It received the assent of the President of India on January 9, 2006.

Even though we have the teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the biggest challenge for the government is to ensure that landslide prone areas are evacuated and are not encroached again. Also, it is necessary to ensure that the trees are planted on such plots to avoid encroachment and to prevent soil erosion and, in turn, landslides.

Some of the Major Landslides that have taken place in the last 25 years:

June 16, 2013 – ​Kedarnath, Uttarakhand – In June 2013, a multi-day cloudburst centred on the North Indian state of Uttarakhand caused devastating floods and landslides in the country's worst natural disaster, which saw more than 5,700 casualties

September 24, 2012 – Northern Sikkim – 27 people diad, including members of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP)

July 27, 2007 – Dasalgaon-Maharashtra – 50+ casualties.

July 26, 2005 – Raigad – 54 people were killed in landslides, floods in Maharashtra in Raigad

July 26, 2005 – Sakinaka, Mumbai – ​​More than 74 people were dead in a landslide.

November 2001 – Amboori in Kerala – 40 people were killed

August 1998 – Malpa – Entire village was wiped out. The landslide saw approximately 400 casualties.

August 14, 1998 – Okhimath – 69 people were killed in the incident

June 1994 – Konkan Coast – 20 people were killed, breaching of ghat damaged road to an extent of 1km.

August 1993 – Nagaland – 200 houses were destroyed, 500 people died, about 5km stretch of road was damaged

August 1993 – Kalimpong, West Bengal – About 40 people were killed, leading to heavy loss of property.

July 1993 – Itanagar – ​25 people were buried alive.

July 1991 – Assam – 300 people were killed, road and buildings were damaged.

In a study done on landslides, the Defence Terrain Research Laboratory and DRDO have observed following things that triggers landslides:

Most landslides are triggered by rains.

High intensity rainfalls are related with debris flow.

High amount of rainfall and duration are responsible for deep seated landslides.

Instrumental set up monitoring ground water regime, surface and sub-surface movements found suitable for realization of Early Warning System

Data driven (statistical), Knowledge driven (heuristics) and,

Deterministic (process) models are being evaluated





Natural causes include:

Elevation of pore water pressure by saturation of slope material from either

Intense or prolonged rainfall and seepage

Vibrations caused by earthquakes.

Undercutting of cliffs and banks by waves or river erosion.

Volcanic eruptions.



Human causes include:

Deforestation

Interference with, or changes to, natural drainage

Leaking pipes such as water and sewer reticulation

Modification of slopes by construction of roads, railways, buildings

Overloading slopes

Mining and quarrying activities

Vibrations from heavy traffic, blasting, etc

Excavation or displacement of rocks



327 hilly areas are dangerous in Mumbai

According to the information obtained under RTI, Over 22,483 hutment in 327 hilly areas across 25 Assembly constituencies in the city, including Western and Eastern suburbs, ​are dangerous and the people living there need to be shifted as soon as possible. In the main city, 49 spots are dangerous in which total hutments are 3986, while in Mumbai Suburb 278 spots are most dangerous.

“the BMC and the Mumbai Suburban Collectorate had jointly carried out a survey of hutments and submitted findings in a report to the state Housing Ministry on April 17, 2010.This report had been sent to the Government for final consideration, but it is still awaiting the state nod.” said RTI activist Anil Galgali,

Galgali further added, ""As per the survey report, there are 327 hilly, which areas classified as dangerous. Out of the 22483 huts in these areas, the authorities recommended shifting 9,657 huts on a priority basis, while the remaining could be protected by constructing retaining walls around the hills.""

Since 1995, an amount of Rs 200 crore has been spent on constructing retaining walls, but the government could not prevent natural disaster from claiming lives.

""I believe the state government, instead of spending crores of rupees constructing retaining walls, should shift slum-dwellers to the 15,000 vacant MMRDA and BMC tenements across the city,"" said Galgali.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

The last 10 days have been among the most testing phases of Mehrajuddin Wadoo's life. The former India footballer has been frantically trying to get in touch with his parents — 60-year-old Mohammad Sultan Wadoo and 52-year-old Hajra Wadoo — who live in Srinagar's Rainawari area that has been inundated by floods leaving nearly 1.5 lakh stranded and at least 250 dead in the state of Jammu & Kashmir.

No communication

With communications in the area down, Wadoo's efforts of calling up home have been in vain. ""I was training in Florence (in Italy) with (Indian Super League team) FC Pune City when I got to know about the floods. I've been frantically calling my family and my friends in J&K since, but haven't been able to get through as the phone lines are dead.

I used to speak to my parents everyday, but haven't spoken to them for nearly 15 days now. I even tried calling our neighbours, but have not been able to connect to anyone. Finally, one of my cousins called another cousin in Pune to inform them that my parents are safe. But I'm yet to hear from them, so I cannot say what the situation there is like.

I don't know where they are right now or how they are coping with the situation. But the FC Pune City officials have put me in touch with the army and they have assured me that they are doing their best,"" Wadoo told mid-day from Pune yesterday.

According to reports yesterday, the Rainawari area witnessed incidents of stone-pelting at the helicopters carrying food and relief material. Even as he scrambles for any updates on his parents, there is some reassurance for Wadoo, with his wife Zulaikha and 16-month-old baby, Mohammad Ahmad, likely to join him in Pune today.

Wadoo's wife and child were staying in another house in the Haiderpur area of Srinagar, closer to the airport. ""I only got in touch with my wife four days after the floods first hit the region. She told me that she and our baby were staying at a friend's place and that they had left as soon as the water started entering our house.

Lucky escape

""It was a lucky escape because the two-storey apartment has been submerged till the first floor. She and the baby have not been getting proper food, but hopefully they will be with me here soon,"" Wadoo said adding that they will be staying with him at the accommodation provided by the Pune ISL franchise.

This is the only thing Kashmiris can think of, we joked, to build a house with three floors for their kids, visiting relatives, and future weddings. It was these three-storeyed houses that saved many people during the floods in Srinagar.When you fly into Srinagar, you typically see a lot of greenery. When I went in on September 11, I saw from the plane several lakes of muddy water with tiny dry patches. The flight was eerie, there were only 15 people on it. There was a strange silence at the airport. The luggage was all cartons. On the streets, there were people with stuff on their heads, gangs of Bihari migrant labourers, garbage all around. The scene kept increasing in terms of its intensity.It started for me on September 6. I got a call from actors in the Piya Behroopiya stage production who had gone there for a show. Two actors were stuck at Pampore on their way back from Pahalgam because of waterlogging. I told them to call up my cousin, Deeba, whose husband is the district collector of Ganderbal. While trying to coordinate this from Mumbai, I learnt that they had made their way to Srinagar through some back roads. Two days later, Deeba and her family were stuck at Rajbagh. They had to abandon their home and go to a relative’s place. Then, I got a call from my mother, who was wailing on the phone because she had got a call from Deeba who said they were going to die because the water had reached the third floor. Deeba had two young daughters, a frail mother-in-law, a diabetic father-in-law. After this call, there was no contact for three days. I started following people on twitter who were reporting from the ground. I bought about 150 kilos of medicines and food. I couldn’t sleep for two nights.When I landed in Srinagar, I got a call from Basharat Peer, the journalist and writer. He told me about a camp in Hyderpora where they needed relief supplies. The main road from the airport was washed out, so I took the back lanes that were dry and reached a camp near my house. Everybody and everything was out on the street. There were tents, doctors sitting under a flyover with two chairs and a table. The gurdwara was like overcrowded refugee camp. The Hyderpora relief camp was set up by local students who started to help without having any disaster management skills. They did what they could, learning on the job as it were.

At the camp, I met Karn Kaushik, a mountaineer, and an Australian chap called Tim Carroll and two guys from Uttarakhand. They were planning to go climbing in Himachal Pradesh when they heard about the floods. They abandoned their expedition and landed up in Srinagar to help in whatever way they could. The guys from Uttarakhand had some experience with rescue work because of last year’s floods in that state. We started going out in boats to distribute supplies and help people stuck in their homes. There weren’t many people who could manoeuvre a boat. I could, since I had been taught swimming and rowing at my school, Tyndale Biscoe, the oldest in Kashmir. We used to have regattas every Wednesday there in the summers.By the time I reached Srinagar, my cousin Deeba and her family had been rescued. They had gotten into an overloaded truck with 200 people on a dark night. My cousin’s husband managed to persuade the driver to take his mother in the front. My cousin, her husband and their daughters were hanging on to a nylon rope from one side of the truck, which was going through the water like a boat. The truck broke down after a kilometre. They walked through the water and took refuge in the lobby of a bank, since they had no access to a higher floor. But when the water came in there too, they had to break though a 14-foot high wall and fling people onto the other side, onto dry land, near Dal Gate bridge. She said throughout this ordeal, there were young men appearing and giving a helping hand. She called them angels in the dark.My cousin later told me that she saw fear in her husband’s eyes, as well as his dilemma – who would he have saved? He had two ailing parents, two daughters, an uncle and an aunt. And he was the only one who could swim in the family. She tells me that she still can’t sleep at night thinking about his dilemma.The main narrative in the national media for the first two days was “Army. Army, Army.” They reacted with 50 boats, which is nothing for a whole city. On the ground, it was something else. The first response was purely local.People used makeshift planks, tire tubes, plastic water tanks cut unto half. I heard a story about a truck driver whose truck broke down, and who took out the tyres, made a raft out of them, and rescued 250 people. People flew in from abroad to save their families – somebody came from Turkey with a boat and went straight from the airport to rescue his mother. Another, a doctor, flew in from Norwich, England.There were several stories of people with homes under water, who were helping others before their own families. My school friend, Tahir Ali Khan, rescued people from his neighbourhood while his own family was rescued by others. Everybody was taken by surprise, and the response was purely instinctual. Yes, people have suffered in Kashmir in various ways, and there is a feeling of being close-knit. When somebody dies, the whole neighbourhood turns out and the neighbours make the funeral arrangements. But something like this is altogether different. When one’s own family is under threat, to be selfless is something else.

None of the rescue efforts happened in any organised manner. We used to get information about an address and investigate. Sometimes, we couldn’t find the place. Other times, there were people sitting on their terraces gazing at a lake of water who seemed calmer than the people on land. They didn’t leave their homes because they didn’t want to be homeless. The fear of not knowing where they were gong to end up made them stay.The most striking image for me was from the Bemina neighbourhood. We rescued an old, frail, baby-faced blind man. He was sitting on a ledge. When we tried to take him out of the boat and put him on dry land, he refused to put his feet down clinging on to Karn. The blind man had lost his capability of recognising his surroundings by instinct.When people lose everything, they try and save that one thing. A friend’s ailing parents took only their medicines and passports. My friend, a psychiatrist in England, had to bring clothes for them, because they didn’t have any. A nine-month pregnant woman, who is a doctor, took only her medical school certificates. A lawyer cousin hoped he could still retrieve at least some of his law books from his personal library. Another friend, the journalist Pervez Bukhari, rued the fact that out of his substantial book collection, he couldn’t save a 250-year-old handwritten manuscript of the Quran, which is a family heirloom. He remembers walking out of his gate, seeing a nine-foot wall of water in which a Scorpio car with its headlights on and its driver inside was being tossed around. He ran back in, but by then, the water had already flooded the ground floor. He and a friend rescued a calf from the third-floor window, which was floating in the water with just the whites of its eyes and its nostrils visible. They have kept him, and have named him Sultan.

The last time there was a flood in Kashmir in 1998, some rural areas were affected. But the sheer scale of this one…to lose a capital, a city, all manner of infrastructure. We had no reference point for anything like this, just like Bombay hadn’t seen anything like the 2005 floods. I can buy the point that government officials couldn’t help because they too were under water, but then you have to find a way to do something. You have to be seen to do something other than photo ops in an army helicopter.There was major anger against what the media did for the first few days – saying that Kashmir should be grateful for the help it was getting. After that, I stopped watching the news. The security establishment has humiliated the population for 25 years and more, and now you are rubbing their noses in it because you saved their lives. You have been selling this tale to the world even before the flood, and you are now doing it more vociferously because of the change in dispensation at the Centre. The Army would have saved lives regardless of where they were because that is what they do. In some places, the Army needed rescuing themselves – in a village in Pulwama, which is known for its stone pelting, the villagers rescued 18 soldiers one night. You don’t hear stories like this in the mainstream media.The water has started receding in some parts, but the worst is yet to come. Most of the hospitals are gone, including the diagnostic centres. A doctor friend asked how could they diagnose ailments if one can’t get a simple blood test done.

People are staying at other people’s homes. People are trying to clean out their homes, but how is it going to work? What happens to the houses that have been damaged and are unsafe for habitation? Will people have to abandon their homes and buy homes elsewhere? How will they do this? Will there be an evaluation of the damage done to the spine of the economy – the handicraft stores, the shawl sellers, the hotels? Most critically, how will the people who’ve lost their homes, survive the bitter winter?On the flight back, it was as if the wind had been knocked out of me. I’d been running on adrenalin for nearly eight days. I was so drained that I fell into a deep sleep. It seemed meaningless coming back to Bombay.As told to Nandini Ramnath.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
477,477,mumbai,2014,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/sgnp-plans-watershed-management-to-stabilise-drinking-water-supply/,26 Jun 2014,SGNP plans watershed management to ‘stabilise’ drinking water supply,"For the first time, the roughly 104 sq km Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) at Borivali will have a watershed management plan, set to improve the park’s water-retaining capacity. The plan will involve increasing the capacity of lakes Vihar and Tulsi, sources of drinking water for the city, by “stabilising and regulating flow (of streams) into the lakes”.

Currently, foresters are surveying the entire park area and mapping waterholes using GPS instruments. During the monsoon, the officers will record the behaviour of streams – the flow, length, areas through which they pass and animals that use them. The data compiled will then be superimposed on existing GIS maps of the park.

“By October-end, we hope to have the plan ready. So far, we used to construct artificial water holes inside the park whenever there was a scarcity. Now, we will manage the natural watersheds in an organised manner and give priority to natural water springs. This will help the wildlife, vegetation and help Mumbaikars’ water needs,” said Vikas Gupta, chief conservator, SGNP.

With the plan ready and funds sanctioned by the end of this year, forest officials will increase vegetation around the lakes and streams, install silt traps in and around the streams to retain the soil and avoid excess siltation in the lakes. Excavation to create natural storages, diversions with the help of boulders and small check dams using brush wood (twigs, hummus) will be part of the project.

Through these “minimal intervention and natural” methods, SGNP officials will try to disperse the available water to all areas of the park, especially during the lean period.The whole project will take around a year and a half, entailing two dry seasons, said Vijay Paranjpye, water expert and chairman of Gomukh Environmental Trust For Sustainable Development, Pune.

“The aim is habitat conservation through soil, water and biological conservation,” said Paranjpye. “Any conservation work done will directly increase the release of water into these lakes– helping improve water supply to the city and reducing the intensity of floods occurring due to runoffs into areas outside the park.”Paranjpye explained the 2005 deluge in Mumbai was partly because of excess water flowing into the creek from Mithi. By retaining the water within the park, the excess water can be kept from running off into the creek.

The project, its planning and implementation, will involve the foresters as opposed to being contracted out and they will become the best interpreters of the park.

PUNE: Two typewritten letters from several decades ago adorn a proud corner of the 83-year-old International Book Service in Pune. The pages of these letters could be yellowing with age, but their significance is as much historical as it is about the rare bond a national leader shared with a bookstore.The two letters showcased in this shop were typed and signed by the first Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru in 1961, after a devastating flood had hit Pune.The Times of India had reported then that this shop, which had rare books from across the world, was Nehru’s first stop in flood-hit Pune. On August 11, 1961, Nehru— who had visited the city-based book store thrice before the flood and finally on July 26, 1961— wrote with deep remorse to the store’s owner, V N Dixit: “...It was sad that your work of many years should be largely destroyed by floods. But I have no doubt that this will be reborn again and will function with greater vigour…”The International Book Service was established in January 1, 1931, and was possibly one of Nehru’s favorite bookstores. In a letter to his daughter Indira Gandhi — compiled in ‘Two Alone, Two Together: Letters between Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru’— Nehru wrote: “I have often sent you names of books, mostly new and sometimes old, which I wanted you to purchase for me. But you could not get them at the usual booksellers. You might keep a list of those books with you in case they are now available. In particular I want you to note down the name of a good bookshop in Poona which often keeps books which cannot be obtained elsewhere. This is: The International Book Depot, Deccan Gymkhana, Poona Fort.”Upendra Dixit, the current owner, recollects the day when Nehru visited the store in 1961 and met his father. “Nehru was visiting Pune after the Panshet floods. He was on his motorcade in an open jeep and was accompanied by state’s first chief minister Yashwantrao Chavan and the then state governor Sri Prakasa. The motorcade was coming from the other side of the road, when Nehru spotted my father outside the store. He told his convoy to stop his jeep as he wanted to see my father. He got out of the vehicle, walked towards the store, came inside and spent half an hour assessing the damage the flood had caused,” said the 74-year-old.Dixit remembers that the flood had destroyed the store and at one point the structure had gone completely under water. Nehru regretted the destruction, but expressed confidence in Dixit’s ability to rebuild it. “Nehru visited the store four times during his lifetime, the last time in 1961. He had a great affinity for books and voraciously read works on history, international relations, politics and biographies. I was in Mumbai when I read in the newspapers he visited our store and felt sorry that I had missed the chance to see him,” said Dixit.V N Dixit finally rebuilt the book store and decided to reopen it on the Independence Day of 1961. He wrote to Nehru—who, by then, had become a close acquaintance—informing him about the feat.Soon V N Dixit received a letter dated August 11, 1961, carrying the stamp of ‘Prime Minister’s House, New Delhi’. It was personally signed by Nehru and read: Dear Shri Dixit, I have your letter of the 9th August. I am happy to learn that the International Book Service is going to reopen on Independence Day, the 15th August. You have, of course, all my good wishes. Your book service has many admirers all over India. I have been one of them. It was sad that your work of many years should be largely destroyed by floods. But I have no doubt that this will be reborn again and will function with greater vigour.”In another letter on August 12, 1961, Nehru wrote: You certainly have all my good wishes in the re-building of your International Book Service. This service did very good work and was commended by many people in the past. The disaster that overtook it last year was painful. But I have no doubt that you will build it anew and make it even better than before.

In a replay of events of 2011, over 60 villages of Balluana and Abohar have been affected due to diversion of flood waters from Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal’s constituency of Lambi. Farmers of both sub-divisions have complained to the district administration that their losses have mounted after water, drained from Lambi villages, flooded their villages.

Heavy rainfall last week and at the start of this week has caused flooding in Lambi, Balluna and Abohar. A total of 19 villages of Lambi were affected on September 5 and 55 pumps have been installed to pump out the water. The pumped out water has, however, flooded 60 villages of Balluana and Abohar.

While at least 40 persons have lost their lives in the Garo Hills in Meghalaya, as many as 26 bodies have been fished out from the water in Goalpara and Kamrup districts in Assam in the past two days. Confirming this, Assam forest minister Rakibul Hussain said the final death figure could be much more because many people are reportedly missing and suspected to have been washed away. “Many villages are still totally submerged, with water flowing above the roofs. Rescue teams have yet to cover all the affected villages,” Hussain said.

Though columns of the Army and BSF are pressed into rescue operations alongside the NDRF and SDRF teams, they have not been able to reach out because most villages are still submerged, the minister pointed out. The number of cattle and other domestic animals washed away are yet to be ascertained.

In Goalpara, of the 14 bodies recovered so far, two are infants, they being Apsara Hujuri (one year two months) and Prakash Rabha (two years six months). The dead also include five women, Hussain said. In Kamrup district on the other hand 12 bodies have been recovered so far. With five deaths in Guwahati city and one in Dhubri, the total death toll in the last three days’ floods in Assam has gone up to 31.

The flood waters came down like a huge wall several metres high and even washed away trucks and cars off the NH 37 for several hundred metres. In Krishnai, Dudhnoi and Bolbola, all highway townships, trucks, cars and other vehicles are lying strewn by the roadside after the floodwaters were gone. In Bolbola, at least 180 persons were killed in a flash flood in 2004.

Minister Hussain, who visited Goalpara and Kamrup today said at least six lakh population have been affected by floods in the two districts in since Sunday night. While four lakh have been affected in Kamrup, 2.11 lakh have been affected in Goalpara. About 1.4 lakh people have been put up in relief camps while thousands have taken shelter under the open sky on the highway and other roads.

Several bridges that have been washed away include an RCC bridge on the Krishnai river in Goalpara. “There has been extensive damage to the National Highway, railway track, state roads as well as village roads. A final assessment will be possible only when the floods recede further in the next two or three days,” minister Hussain informed.

Meanwhile, several localities in Guwahati city continued to remain submerged for the third day today after flash floods hit the Assam capital following incessant rains since Saturday. The army was deployed in Anilnagar and Tarun-nagar, two worst-hit localities.

Rajnath Singh today calls up Tarun Gogoi:

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday called up Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi to take stock of the flood situation in the state. Official sources said while Singh called up in the morning, Gogoi apprised the Home Minister about the slew of steps initiated by the state government to rescue the marooned people in the flood-hit areas of Goalpara, Dhubri, Kamrup (Metro), Kamrup and other districts with the assistance of NDRF, SDRF, Army and paramilitary forces. Gogoi told Singh that scores of marooned people have been evacuated and efforts are on to rescue the stranded ones.

The chief minister also told the union home minister about a slight improvement in the flood situation following a let-up in rainfall in the past 24 hours. However, Gogoi described the situation as ‘grim and critical’. Gogoi also apprised about the relief operations being carried out by the district administrations and the opening up of relief camps for the flood affected people.

As he watches, Shivendra Pandey, seated on the floor of his shop near Rudraprayag, looks around for the remote control, to switch to another channel. A former panda (priest) at the Kedarnath temple, Pandey still carries the psychological scars of that calamity in July 2013. He had to flee the area to save himself in July 2013.

Close to a year after the disaster, as the Chardham Yatra started once again on 2 May, memories of last year have begun to haunt not only those affected but also the Congress, the ruling party in Uttarakhand.

The post-calamity development work, or the lack of it, is going to decide the fate of the Lok Sabha seats in the state, according to political observers here. One of the biggest worries for Chief Minister Harish Rawat is that his promise to people that he would reconstruct the mountain roads before the commencement of the Chardham Yatra has fallen flat. According to sources in the Congress, the only place where this will not affect the party's prospects is in Rawat's own constituency, Haridwar, which is pretty much on the flats and self-sufficient because of its own flourishing tourist economy.

""Everyday, party workers have to answer angry voters and it will cost us a huge vote share. The state government should have taken better care of the situation,"" says a Congress leader who was a minister in an earlier Congress government. While the Congress foresees trouble in constituencies such as Tehri Garhwal, it expects the biggest blow from the Pauri Garhwal constituency. This, especially after veteran Congress leader Satpal Maharaj, the Congress MP from the region, left the party to join the BJP. A popular leader, Satpal played an important part in the Uttarakhand statehood movement.

""The government has completely failed to take care of thousands of people who lost their means of livelihood in the disaster,"" he says. Even some Congress workers in Srinagar, the most important town of Pauri Garhwal, agree. ""Satpal was the only person who could have offered a good challenge to BC Khanduri, the BJP's candidate. With him gone, the Congress is in dire straits,"" says Rajeev Bahuguna, a member of the Congress district committee.

Satpal Maharaj taking on the Congress is only a reflection of his voters' anger with the government. ""The government has failed to measure the number of deaths till date. The number of casualties provided by it is only a tiny fraction of the number of people who really died in the natural disaster,"" says Ravindra Raturi, a trader from Rudraprayag.

The people of this valley are still unhappy with the way the relief work was conducted after the flash flood. ""The Congress ministers got hold of the helicopters that were meant for bringing relief packages. They were travelling by helicopters to reach Kedarnath to appear in the media,"" says Raturi. The Congress MLA from Rudraprayag, Harak Singh Rawat, who was criticised heavily for not doing enough in the aftermath of the disaster, is now the Lok Sabha candidate from Pauri Garhwal.

However, if the sentiments of the people on the banks of the river Ganga are to be read, they don't seem to have much faith either in the Congress or the BJP. They don't feel either party will do much to save the river, the fulcrum of the ecology and economy of the mountains. ""There are thousands of hotels on the river beds and how could they have been built without the politicians taking money?"" asks Rakesh Negi, a 23-year-old student from Srinagar. ""How come there were thousands of properties in Kedarnath? There was no clearance for building two, three-storey hotels in those areas. But it's been done with the knowledge of the governments,"" rues Rakesh, who will vote for the first time.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Sacred portals of the Kedarnath temple were reopened to devotees amid elaborate rituals early this morning, about a year after the Himalayan shrine was marred by flash floods that had left hundreds of people dead and many others stranded.Chief priest of the shrine (Rawal) Bhima Shankar Ling presided over the rituals as its gates were opened amid chanting of vedic hymns, Badrinath-Kedarnath temple committee CEO V D Singh told PTI over phone.About 1,252 devotees including eight foreign nationals visited the shrine on the opening day, he said.

It is the first 'Char Dham' yatra after last year's calamity.The annual pilgrimage was struck by the unprecedented flash floods last year causing large scale loss of lives and property. Over 5,000 people are dead or missing, including pilgrims from various parts of the country.Expressing happiness over the first day turnout, Mr Singh said it was much more than their expectations.""The crowd was bigger than expected and there was much enthusiasm among the devotees. It is an indication that the fear psychosis gripping people outside the state in the wake of last year's tragedy is subsiding gradually.""The crowd of visitors is likely to swell as the snow begins to melt,"" he said.Arrangements for a round-the-clock langar have been made by the temple committee near the shrine to cater to visitors.Makeshift tents have been pitched at several places en route to the temple to accommodate more than a thousand people.There are enough food supplies available, he said.However, Pandit Jasraj, who was to perform live at the shrine on its opening day, could not come, he said.Tourism and Culture Secretary Umakant Panwar said the Indian classical vocalist had to cancel his programme yesterday as it was unsafe for him to fly in a chopper to the high altitude shrine which is still clogged with snow.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

For six years, owing to an aquifer that South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) engineers now claim they “missed” during the time of soil-testing, water has been constantly flowing into the basement of the hospital.

As construction workers dug two floors underground to provide parking at the eight-storey multi-speciality hospital, the water from the aquifer filled the basement, which the workers have been pumping out continuously.

The ambitious project, approved by the unified corporation in 2008, remains under construction even two and a half years post deadline. The project was approved at a cost of approximately Rs 31 crore. However, due to delays and cost escalation, the present expenditure stands well over Rs 52 crore, according to Leader of the Opposition in SDMC Farhad Suri.

“This is double-speak on behalf of the SDMC staff as, on the one hand, they say they conducted soil-testing at the site and, on the other, they claim anywhere you dig in the area, water is bound to spring up,” Suri said.

Speaking to Newsline, Leader of the House in SDMC Subhash Arya said the funds for the hospital were provided to the corporation in phases, which caused the delay in construction. He said tenders for electricity and other fittings were being finalised, but “a final date for completion cannot yet be fixed”. “The hospital needs an investment of an additional Rs 3 crore. We will provide that soon and hopefully the project will be completed this year,” Arya said.

The hospital, named after former BJP MLA from Kalkaji Poornima Sethi, was expected to be completed within two and a half years. Until now, only the structure of the 100-bed hospital is ready and utility services, sewer and water connections as well as equipment for the hospital have been arranged.

“In my capacity as Leader of the Opposition, I will file a complaint with the National Green Tribunal on Wednesday, as gallons of potable water are being drained into the sewers that can resolve the water scarcity in the Kalkaji area,” Suri said.

The hospital is currently operating from a space borrowed from an MCD school in the neighbourhood.

19-year-old Tanvir Ahmed Sheikh sits slumped in his shikara wooden taxi boat on the banks of Kashmir's Dal Lake, exhausted by deadly floods that have ravaged this normally tranquil tourist haven.Sheikh and a small army of fellow shikara owners, who normally ferry holidaymakers around the lake using only a wooden pole, have spent the last five days rescuing those stranded on sinking houseboats and bringing them to safety.""The women especially have been very afraid, and those first few hours were really dangerous,"" Sheikh told AFP as he took a breather in his boat, rocking in the swollen currents.

""There are so many people to help,"" he said as two men asked if he could row them out onto the lake to check on relatives feared stranded.""It's not humanly possible to evacuate everyone,"" added Sheikh who has been snatching a few hours' sleep at a local mosque when he can.Dal Lake, dubbed Kashmir's ""Jewel in the Crown"", is home to hundreds of ornate houseboats which date back to the colonial era when the British sought a Himalayan refuge from Delhi's stifling summer temperatures.The Beatles' George Harrison learnt to play the sitar on one of the ""floating palaces"" that are moored to the side of the lake and are overlooked by Mughal gardens and snow-capped Himalayan peaks.While the numbers of Western tourists have fallen off in recent decades as result of the unrest in Kashmir, it has become increasingly popular with Indian holidaymakers -- many of whom were caught unawares on the lake when the flooding began at the weekend.Triggered by heavy monsoon rains, the floods have so far claimed over 200 lives. Although the exact scale of the disaster is still unclear, the floodwaters have swallowed whole villages and left much of Kashmir's main city of Srinagar underwater.Thousands of soldiers and other emergency workers, using boats and helicopters, have been racing around the clock to rescue those still marooned and to provide water, blankets and other relief.'NO ONE TO HELP'But on the banks of Dal Lake, Srinagar residents singled out the shikara owners for praise, saying they had been the ones to step up when rescue officials failed to appear.""There has been no help here. Nobody has managed to reach here,"" Nasir Ali Khan said angrily, adding that he saw at least five houseboats break up and sink in the rushing waters.""All of the rescues have been done by these young men rowing shikaras,"" he added.A ride on a shikara, a boat similar to the gondolas of Venice, is usually a magical experience for passengers as they gaze out towards the mountains and breathe in the fresh air.But on a tour around the lake on Thursday, an AFP reporter witnessed several sunken houseboats while dozens of tourist shops on the banks were flooded and their wares ruined.Hundreds of people -- local families with children, as well as tourists -- have been camping in the open on the edges of the expanded lake, waiting for help to arrive.Others, who initially fled to higher ground, have returned in the hope of hearing news of relatives and friends still feared stranded on the lake or worse, and to check on their homes and livelihoods.Mustaq Ahmad said he raced his wife, three children and a couple who were holidaying on his houseboat onto his shikara when the first surge of water hit.""I said, 'leave your belongings and get on',"" Ahmad told AFP.""We just went along with the current, racing for about a kilometre until we finally hit dry land.""Ghulam Hassan, who has lived on the lake's banks all of his 79 years, said he feared the floods would prove more devastating than the last major ones in the 1950s.""This is the most ferocious flood ever,"" he said.""I don't understand what happened this time.

Tour operators said because of discounts being provided by various airlines, the number of bookings for travel to Kashmir from West Bengal was as high as 60,000 during the Puja season.

""But around 70-75 per cent of travellers to J&K have cancelled their trips. The rest are thinking twice now. Even we don't encourage people to travel during or immediately after a natural calamity,"" Anil Punjabi, chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India, said.

He says people are worried about what situation the tourists spots will be in the post-calamity scenario and whether the infrastructure will be good enough for travelling and a pleasant stay with their friends and family. The J&K tourism department has already issued a flood advisory for tourists advising them to postpone their travel plans to the state in view of the prevailing flood situation.

The work of tour operators have doubled now as tourists are demanding alternate travel plans besides cancellation of the existing tour. Big tourist spots like the beaches of Goa and the backwaters of Kerala are being preferred as alternate tourists destinations. Durga Puja season, which falls in the first week of October, is a major vacation period for people of West Bengal as all offices and educational institutes are closed for at least 3-4 days.

Businessman Abhijeet Churoria, who planned a week-long family tour to Kashmir said he was scared to travel to the state even after the situation returns to normal next month. ""After the Uttarakhand disaster we don't want to take any risk in the mountains. Even in Kashmir we are hearing how tourists are left stranded. I know the situation will return to normal next month but we are still scared to travel. Now we are changing our tour to Goa,"" he said.

Budget is another concern for tourists who are changing their plans. ""They do not want to pay more and after cancellations we have to keep sure their budget doesn't change. But the airline rates have changed since then. So we are having a tough time in managing it,"" said Punjabi, who runs ARES Travels.

Besides other tourists spots in the state, many had also planned for Vaishno Devi 'darshan' and visit Ladakh.

The new study, part of an ongoing OECD project, examined maps and databases of population and world assets, flood-prone regions, storm frequency data, and cost of damage models for 136 large coastal cities. For the first time, it took into account existing coastal defenses and their level of protection.

In terms of the overall cost of damage, the cities at the greatest risk are: 1) Guangzhou, 2) Miami, 3) New York, 4) New Orleans, 5) Mumbai, 6) Nagoya, 7) Tampa, 8) Boston, 9) Shenzen, and 10) Osaka. The top four cities alone account for 43% of the forecast total global losses.

However, developing-country cities move up the list when flood costs are measured as a percentage of city gross domestic product (GDP). Many of them are growing rapidly, have large populations, are poor, and are exposed to tropical storms and sinking land.

The study lists the 10 most vulnerable cities when measured as percentage of GDP as: 1) Guangzhou; 2) New Orleans; 3) Guayaquil, Ecuador; 4) Ho Chi Minh City; 5) Abidjan; 6) Zhanjing; 7) Mumbai; 8) Khulna, Bangladesh; 9) Palembang, Indonesia; and 10) Shenzen.

In most of these cities, the poor are most at risk as rapid urbanization has pushed them into the most vulnerable neighborhoods, often in low-lying areas and along waterways prone to flooding.

Taking action now

One warning from the study's findings appearing in the journal Nature Climate Change is that the cities where flood risk will increase most are not the cities where the risk is particularly high today. Port cities that haven't been highly vulnerable in the past are among those facing the greatest increase in risk by 2050. Leading the cities with the greatest increase in risk are Alexandria, Egypt; Barranquilla, Colombia; Naples, Italy; Sapporo, Japan; and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

“Coastal defenses reduce the risk of floods today, but they also attract population and assets in protected areas and thus put them at risk in case of the defense fails, or if an event overwhelms it. If they are not upgraded regularly and proactively as risk increases with climate change and subsidence, defenses can magnify – not reduce – the vulnerability of some cities,” Hallegatte said.

With better defenses, more people will be dependent on dikes and sea walls, and losses when those defenses fail to protect the city will get bigger. Along with better structural defenses, cities will need better crisis management and contingency planning, including early warning systems and evacuation plans, Hallegatte said.

In cities where flood damage hasn't been common, spending money on flood defenses can be politically unpopular. The challenge facing government officials today is investing in protection before the damage occurs.

For small countries, protection and preparation are especially important. A devastating flood in a key city can stall the entire economy of a small country, making recovery and reconstruction even more difficult. For all of the cities, the preparation will save lives and money in the future.",issue,2011 Thailand floods,Thailand,"October 25, 2011","January 10, 2012","Bangkok, Ayutthaya, Nakhon Pathom, Suphan Buri, Ratchaburi, Kanchanaburi, Phetchaburi, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Chumphon, Surat Thani, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Phatthalung, Songkhla, Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat",450 mm,$45 billion,811,13 million people affected,"The floods were the worst in Thailand's history and caused widespread damage and loss of life.

They feared that the total claims could exceed the record ₹ 3,500 crore mark that the insurance industry faced in 2005 because of floods in Mumbai.

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority, or Irda, sent a note to insurers regarding the claims last Thursday, which was then followed by meetings among the four state-owned general insurers and exchange of mails among other insurers to assess the share of claims that could arise because of the disaster.

Reinsurer GIC Re has also sent notes to general insurers asking them about their exposure in the covers provided by the latter in the affected areas through reinsurance. There are 24 life insurers and 27 general insurers in India.

“The total claims could possibly be more than the ₹ 3,500 crore mark, for the simple reason that the number of lives lost and the amount of damages due to Uttarakhand calamities this time clearly seem to be much more than that happened in Mumbai floods,"" said Amarnath Ananthanarayanan, CEO and managing director, Bharti AXA General Insurance Co. Ltd. “A better estimation of claims on personal accident and health may take 6-8 weeks and most of the claims could come from life and motor space.""

Insurers feel that most of the claims could come in the life and motor insurance space as preliminary reports suggest heavy losses. This could be followed by claims from companies, especially in the power generation sector, property insurance and insurance against loss of profit because of interruption of operations, said insurers. Latest reports indicated extensive damage to infrastructure, forcing several hydroelectric stations to shut operations.

“It may be early to estimate the quantum of losses at the moment but personal accident and life insurance claims could lead the list. This could be followed by property loss claims from affected projects and infrastructure. Claims from losses in hydroprojects could be high,"" said T.A. Ramalingam, chief technical officer, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd. “We will get a clearer picture in a week’s time.""

On Monday, state-owned NHPC Ltd told BSE that its Dhauliganga Power Station (280 MW) has stopped power generation because of the cloud burst and unprecedented flood in Uttarakhand.

“Efforts are being made to restore the generation at the earliest,"" it said. In addition to this, the water has caused damage to various ancillary structures of the project like roads, residential and non-residential buildings. The extent of damage is being worked out.""

NHPC said that the project is covered under “All Risk Insurance Policy"".

Jaiprakash Power Ventures Ltd too had to stop power generation because of the devastation. On Monday, Jaiprakash Power Ventures informed BSE that it had to shut barrage operations and power generation at its 400 MW Vishnuprayag Hydro-power plant with effect from 16 June.

While the company is taking steps to restore generation, the assessment of damages will be made on the restoration of communications and access to the barrage site, the company said, adding that the Vishnuprayag project is covered under industrial all-risk insurance policy.

The extent of losses and claims can be assessed by insurers only after insurance officials are allowed to inspect the areas.

“We feel maximum claims will come from personal accident, motor and property. During the Mumbai floods, the industry settled claims of around ₹ 2,900 crore, which was lower than the claims made,"" said R. Chandrasekaran, secretary general, General Insurance Council, the representative body of Indian general insurance companies. “The industry is... prepared to handle the claims due to the Uttarakhand tragedy, but it is difficult to predict the impact on the industry’s books so early.""

Insurers have been discussing the setting up of a pool to deal with such emergencies as they exchange mails over the past few days to work in tandem and assess the share of claims settlement. “What we feel is that the creation of a catastrophe pool in India is the need of the hour to handle such contingencies due to natural calamities in future. We have been talking about it for the past few years but it has been limited to discussions only,"" said Ananthanarayanan

The study,undertaken by Sherly M A,a research scholar at IIT Bombay-Monash Research Academy,is aimed at assessing and mapping the spatial-temporal pattern of hydrologic,hydraulic,socio-economic and infrastructural elements that contribute to flood risk and vulnerability for Mumbai.

The commercial capital of India is a small island city with a geographical area of less than 500 sq km (under MCGM). It has a population density of around 20,000 persons per sq km and more than 50 per cent population lives in slum areas. The city faces floods almost annually due to heavy rainfall during the south-west monsoon. The ever-growing population has resulted in rampant encroachment,leading to the blocking of natural channels that used to drain rainwater. Its impaired drainage system and high tides make the city and its infrastructure vulnerable, said Sherly.

According to the findings, slum areas in Mankhurd,Govandi and Deonar in M-East ward,Trombay in M-West ward,Bhandup-East in S-ward and Mulund-East in T-ward are socio-economically vulnerable.

The slum areas of wards M/E and M/W are ill-equipped,both socio-economically and in terms of infrastructure-wise to tackle a flood-like situation, she added.

The map,which is likely to be ready in another year,will be colour-coded and will cover the MCGM area. It will show spatial pattern of flood risk in different colours as very low,low,medium,high,and very high. Such a map will depict the product of probability of occurrence of a hazard (flood event of a particular magnitude),its exposure and vulnerability of the affected population to flood disaster. A flood risk map depicts the spatial pattern of flood risk over a region. The term risk has been explained in different ways by technocrats and social scientists. In many places,flood hazard map is called flood risk map. There are risk insurance companies who prepare flood risk maps purely from an economic point of view. Hence,research is on globally to achieve a full-fledged flood risk map,considering its multi-disciplinary nature, she said.

According to Sherly,as part of such research works,flood risk maps have been developed for cities like Valencia,Seoul,London (Ontario),Dhaka,Santiago de Chile.

As per the model followed by IIT Bombay-Monash,the creation of the map will involve developing a flood hazard map,which is generated using flood modeling,taking into consideration the combined effect rainfall and tide. The second,a flood vulnerability map,is generated by two types of vulnerabilities,infrastructure and socio-economic. Infrastructure vulnerabilities are assessed in terms of the possible extent of inundation of critical facilities such as hospitals,public buildings,emergency shelters,schools,and of emergency services such as fire stations and police stations. The information,aggregated in a geographic information system (GIS) environment,is combined to create the overall risk map, said Sherly.

Sherlys guide,IIT-Bombay Prof Subhankar Karmakar said such a map would enable decision-makers to create land development plans,land zoning laws,emergency response strategies,disaster recovery,and infrastructure development.

To do so, they compiled data on 136 coastal cities with more than 1 million residents, looking at the elevation of the cities, the population distribution and the types of flood protection they had, such as levees or storm-surge barriers.

They then combined that data with forecasts of sea level rise, ground sinking due to groundwater depletion, as well as population growth projections and economic forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP). From there, they used the depth of water flooding a city to estimate the cost of the damage. [Read full story on coastal flooding]

In both their best- and worst-case projections of sea level rise, the yearly global cost reached higher than $1 trillion. The most vulnerable city was Guangzhou, China, followed by Mumbai and Kolkata in India, Guayaquil, Ecuador and Shenzen, China.

CNN —

Indian authorities scrambled to rescue thousands of people trapped after floods and landslides ravaged the Himalayan region, leaving up to 1,000 feared dead.

The exact number of those killed will not be clear until the muddy waters are cleaned up and the bodies recovered, said Vijay Bahuguna, the chief minister of Uttarakhand state, which is the worst-hit.

“Certainly, the number of the dead is much higher than 550 … and it could be around 1,000 as figures coming in suggest,” he said Saturday.

Emergency operations include the military and all forms of transportation, including trains moving people for free.

About 70,000 have been evacuated since the floods hit this month.

Barrages of water, mud and rocks have hit scores of towns and villages in the Indian state, inundating homes, shrines, roads and vehicles.

Bahuguna, has described the disaster as a “Himalayan tsunami.”

Dotted with temples and often referred to as “the Land of Gods,” Uttarakhand attracts large numbers of pilgrims from around India to its mountainous reaches. Those travelers, many of them far from home and short on belongings, are now caught up in the destruction.

Thousands of rescue workers are trying to reach more than 50,000 people cut off by the waters. Bahuguna told CNN’s sister network CNN-IBN on Friday night that the death toll was 556 but could rise. The bodies “were either buried or floating in slush,” he said. It will take 15 days to complete evacuations in the province, he added.

Other parts of northern India, including New Delhi, have also been hit by flooding, but Uttarakhand has suffered the worst of the devastation.

The rains over the region have eased in the past few days, aiding in the rescue of about 30,000 people, Bahuguna said.

Gurjit Singh, who had traveled to the town of Gobindghat with his 12-year-old son, described a chaotic scene as people tried to escape the flooding last week.

“There was nothing but death in front of us,” Singh said Thursday after getting out of a crowded car ferrying people to dry, flat land. “Now that we’ve got out, we feel like we’ve got a second life.”

His son, Rana Udesh Pratap, said the trek to safety was long.

The Mumbai weather bureau has predicted heavy showers for the next 24 hours, with the warning the coastal belt, up to Goa, would witness strong winds accompanied with very heavy downpour. The Vidarbha region may witness thundershowers.



The regional meteorological department has asked fishermen to refrain from venturing out to the sea.



In the city, heavy downpour for the third consecutive day left Mumbaikars exasperated at the snail-like traffic that brought the city to almost a standstill after flash floods waterlogged the roads.

Suburban train services on all three lines — western, central and harbour — were severely disrupted as overflowing sewer water submerged the rail tracks in several regions. At the airport, flights were delayed by 30 minutes to an hour due to low visibility.



Reports trickling in from the Konkan region stated that 10 crew members were rescued from a stranded Kolkata-bound cargo ship.



The ship – MV Shri Jayate – reported an engine failure on Sunday evening and was spotted drifting aimlessly off the shores of Ratnagiri, sparking panic amongst the fishing community residing along the coastline.



“It had reported an engine failure when it was around 5 km into the high seas. It later drifted, and is now stuck around 2 km in the Arabian Sea.

CNN —

Rescue workers in northern India are scrambling to save tens of thousands of people left stranded by devastating floods that have killed as many as 150 people in the region.

One government official described the flooding as a “Himalayan tsunami.”

Triggered by unusually early and heavy monsoon rains, the floods have swept away buildings, roads and vehicles in the mountainous state of Uttarakhand, which borders Nepal and China. The neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh has also been hit.

“Our hearts go out to the families of those who have lost their lives and those who have suffered injury or loss of property in this huge tragedy,” said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who carried out an aerial survey of the affected areas in Uttarakhand on Wednesday.

With bad weather hampering rescue efforts and some areas still under water, officials are struggling to gauge the scale of the disaster.

“Very heavy casualties are feared and I cannot give the exact number without a proper survey,” said Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, according to CNN’s sister network CNN-IBN. He described the severe flooding as a “Himalayan tsunami.”

Singh said Wednesday that estimates put the number of people killed in the floods at 102, but added that “it is feared that loss of lives could eventually be much higher.”

A local official in Uttarakhand, Om Prakash, said that the death toll in the state had reached 150, but cautioned that he wasn’t able to give an exact estimate since some villages were still inundated, CNN-IBN reported Thursday. More than 60,000 people remain stranded, the network said.

Flooding hits holy site

With Hindu shrines set amid its stunning scenery, Uttarakhand is often referred to as “the Land of Gods.”

At the heart of the recent devastation is the town of Kedarnath, the home of a deeply revered Hindu temple that attracts many pilgrims. Images from the area have shown the centuries-old holy town, which sits in a deep valley, swamped with mud and rocks.

Rescue workers reached the town Wednesday and evacuated hundreds of people to safer areas, CNN-IBN reported, but thousands more remain stuck there. The temple is intact, but shops and other buildings surrounding it have been severely damaged, it said.

“The maximum damage has been in Kedarnath and its vicinity,” Singh said.

Extreme weather

The worst of the heavy rain came in the past few days in a region of India where the monsoon doesn’t usually arrive for another month, according to Pedram Javaheri, a CNN International meteorologist.

“Some areas have seen more than twice their average monthly rainfall totals,” he said. It’s “the fastest India’s ever seen the onset of the monsoon season.”

The conditions have now improved somewhat, Javaheri said, predicting that the rain “should be scattered in nature for the next couple of days at least.”

The weather has also brought chaos further south, in the Indian capital, New Delhi, where the Yamuna River has reached its highest level since 2010, according to CNN-IBN.

Flood waters have flowed out into parts of Delhi, inundating streets, shops and homes. Some water from the river has spilled out onto the city’s Outer Ring Road, potentially disrupting traffic, CNN-IBN reported Thursday.

Authorities have relocated more than 5,000 people from affected areas, the network said, citing Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit as saying the situation is under control.",,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 20, 2013","Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh",more than twice their average monthly rainfall totals,tens of thousands of people left stranded,150,severe flooding,Triggered by unusually early and heavy monsoon rains,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

is showing a stable trend on Tuesday, there is no respite to the people living in flooded areas. The local administration claims that all possible measures are being taken to provide relief to the people but these are proving insufficient.

GangaBesides the rural area, a vast stretch of urban localities in low-lying areas is also badly hit by the flood.The urban flooding is considered as a recent phenomenon by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). According to NDMA's National Disaster Management Guidelines for management of floods, flooding in the cities and the towns is a phenomenon, caused by frequent instances of heavy rainfall in a short period of time, indiscriminate encroachment of waterways, inadequate capacity of drains and lack of maintenance of the drainage infrastructure. Of late, it had aggravated.The urban areas of eastern UP in districts like Varanasi, Mirzapur, Ghazipur and Ballia are experiencing the worst floods after 1978. The highest flood point of Ganga was recorded at the level of 73.901 metres in Varanasi, 80.340 metres in Mirzapur and 65.220 metres in Ghazipur in 1978. However, the highest flood point in Ballia was 60.250 metre in 2003.According to the daily bulletin of the Middle Ganga Division-III of Central Water Commission , the river was flowing 1.368 metres above the danger mark in Varanasi, 1.326 metres above in Mirzapur, 1.805 metres above in Ghazipur and 2.425 metres above the danger mark in Ballia on Tuesday. The level of Ganga almost reached close to the highest flood points in Ghazipur and Ballia. The river was flowing just 31 cms below the highest flood point in Ghazipur and 21 cms below in Ballia. However, the river was flowing 1.271 metres and 1.29 metres below the highest flood points in Varanasi and Mirzapur respectively. As per the forecast of CWC, the level may start receding from Wednesday.Meanwhile, the police department got 75 calls on Monday for rescue and relief of the people trapped in flood in different localities. The police department also made an appeal to general public to contact police control room (100) and Jal Police on 9984386616 for help.According to NDMA report, floods being the most common natural disaster, people have, out of experience, devised many ways of coping with them. However, encroachments into the flood plains over the years have aggravated the flood problem and a need to take effective and sustained flood management measures has been felt. Various measures, structural and non-structural, have been taken by the Central and state governments and as a result, considerable protection has been provided to the people. However, more efforts are required in this direction and there is a need to put in place a techno-legal regime to make structures flood-proof and regulate the activities in the flood plains of the rivers.The report says that there is the risk of drowning and physical trauma along with the threat of diseases associated with contamination of water and the creation of mosquito breeding sites. Direct health effects of a flood may include drowning, injuries like cuts, sprains, fractures, electric shocks, diarrhoea, vector and rodent-borne diseases like malaria , leptospirosis, skin and eye infections and psychological stress.The indirect health consequences of floods are usually due to damage caused to health care infrastructure and loss of essential drugs, damage to water and sanitation infrastructure, damage to crops and disruption of food supplies, destruction of property causing lack of shelter that may lead to increased exposure to diseases.According to report, India's high risk and vulnerability is highlighted by the fact that 40 million hectares, out of a geographical area of 3,290 lakh hectares is prone to floods. On an average every year, 75 lakh hectares of land is affected, 1,600 lives are lost and the damage caused to crops, houses and public utilities is Rs 1,805 crores due to floods.The frequency of major floods is more than once in five years. Floods have also occurred in areas, which were earlier not considered flood-prone. As much as 80% of precipitation takes place during monsoon from June to September. The rivers bring heavy sediment load from the catchments. These, coupled with inadequate carrying capacity of the rivers, are responsible for causing floods, drainage congestion and erosion of river banks.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Misery and uncertainty continued to plague thousands of villagers rendered homeless in the interior areas of Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Pithoragarh even as teams of the Army, ITBP, NDRF and State police rescued over 10,000 pilgrims on Sunday. The remaining 7,000 odd pilgrims would be rescued soon, authorities hope.

The rescue operations were hampered by mild showers in places like Dehradun and Joshimath. The Met office has predicted more rains on Monday and Tuesday.

The Director General of Police has ordered all local police chiefs to escort pilgrims trekking their way out to avoid mishaps. Special security would be provided to women, he said.

Many pilgrims and residents wondered why the government had not made proper arrangements for the Char Dham Yatra even after 12 years of formation of Uttarakhand. Disasters due to cloudbursts, flash floods and landslides have been common but the authorities seemed content with small temporary measures after each disaster, said Renu D. Singh of the Samadhan Women Helpline.

Sarita and Neetu, both social activists, wondered why neither the Bharatiya Janata Party nor the Congress allowed the Vidhan Sabha sessions to function. “Important Bills and even the Budget are passed without discussions. Does the electorate elect the MLAs for this,” they asked.

Jagdish Chandra Jakhmola, a retired teacher, wanted the MLAs not to disturb Vidhan Sabha proceedings and seriously debate how disasters could be mitigated in Uttarakhand. The Centre should also make efforts by forming a group of well meaning experts to suggest measures to minimise losses caused by natural calamities and also pitch in with liberal funds for repairing or reinforcing infrastructure, he said.

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, after consulting with religious leaders such as Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati, ordered the officials to immediately send a team to Kedarnath to clear the area of debris and cremate the dead bodies lying there with traditional rituals after postmortem and collection of DNA samples. A ‘mahayagya’ will be held in Haridwar on the 13th day of the tragedy for the peace of the departed souls, Mr. Bahuguna said.

Mr. Bahuguna also said the rehabilitation of Kedarnath shrine was a top priority of the gand it will be carried out after taking suggestions from the Archaeological Survey of India.

Mr. Bahuguna said that the welfare of the disaster-hit villagers was equally important and necessary rations and medical care was being rushed there. “The damaged roads and bridges were making access to the remote areas difficult,” he said.

Second survey

Mr. Bahuguna ordered the rescue teams to make a second survey of areas from where pilgrims had been rescued to make sure no one was left out. The Chief Minister wanted the officials to keep a backup rescue plan ready in view of forecasts of more rains in the coming days.

Union Minister Harish Rawat, who trekked about 18 km from Rudraprayag to Augustmuni on Sunday morning, told The Hindu over phone that devastation in the villages was extensive and it would take a lot of time to bring things back to normal. Mr. Rawat who visited Gauchar also said the ITBP was doing an excellent job in the village-to-village search for survivors in the Kedarnath-Lambagarh area. A large number of houses, hotels, vehicles and agriculture fields have been washed away, Mr. Rawat said.

Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, along with senior Congress leaders Moti Lal Vora and Ambika Soni, reviewed the relief centres set up in Rishikesh and Dehradun.

Mr. Hooda said that 50,000 blankets would be sent for people stranded at various place in Uttarakhand and, out of these, 25,000 blankets had already been dispatched from Panipat on Sunday. He said that buses of Haryana Roadways had been deployed to carry rescued persons from Dehradun, Rishikesh and Haridwar to their destinations free of cost.

The Baluakot and Jualjiwi villages in district Pithoragarh were some of the worst-affected with some of the villagers trekking through hazardous areas to the district headquarters and taking shelter in the homes of relatives or friends. Pramod Tamta who reached the district headquarters said that nearly half of the houses, shops and agricultural fields in Baluakot and Jualjiwi had been washed away.

Heart-rending scenes could be witnessed at the Sahasradhara helipad and Jolly Grant Airport in Dehradun where hundreds of relatives could be seen frantically showing photographs of their kin to the rescued pilgrims, asking them if they had seen their loved ones.",,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 23, 2013","Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Pithoragarh",200 mm,"1000+ houses, hotels, vehicles and agriculture fields washed away","5,700+","Thousands of pilgrims and villagers stranded, many missing",The floods were caused by a cloudburst that triggered landslides and flash floods in the Kedarnath valley.

A study published in Nature Climate Change, has compiled a list of cities most vulnerable to coastal flooding. Taking in consideration elevation, population distribution and available flood protection from 136 coastal cities worldwide, in addition to forecasts of sea level rise and ground sinking due to groundwater depletion, the study determines that if no mitigating steps are taken, coastal flooding will cause damage totaling $1 trillion annually by the year 2050.

Topping the list as the most vulnerable city is Guangzhou, China, followed by Mumbai and Kolkata in India, Guayaquil, Ecuador and Shenzen, China. Almost all cities at the highest risk of flooding damage were in North America or Asia.

The top 20 most vulnerable cities are:

Guangzhou, China Mumbai, India Kolkata, India Guayaquil, Ecuador Shenzen, China Miami, Florida, USA Tianjin, China New York, New York — Newark, New Jersey, USA Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam New Orleans, Louisiana Jakarta, Indonesia Abidjan, Ivory Coast Chennai, India Surat, India Zhanjiang, China Tampa—St. Petersburg, Florida, USA Boston, Massachusetts, USA Bangkok, Thailand Xiamen, China Nagoya, Japan

As many as eight lakh farmers of Srikakulam district lost all their hopes with heavy heavy rain and floods causing damage to crops in two lakh acres.

There is little chance to save standing crops such as paddy, sugar cane, banana, coconut and other varieties with the rains causing havoc in the district. Almost all the mandals received around 25 cm rainfall till 8.30 am on Thursday

As many as 600 villages were marooned due to floods to Mahendratanaya, Bahuda rivers. It is estimated that around 1.2 lakh people were affected in Itchapuram, Kanchili, Kaviti, Mandasa, Sompeta and Vajrapukotturu mandals.

Train services hit

Rail and road network between AP and Odisha got disrupted as flood water flowing over the track in Itchapuram. Many trains were either delayed or cancelled. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Itchapuram, Palasa and Srikakulam stations. East Coast Railway authorities are trying to restore tracks in many areas. The train movement will begin only after thorough inspection of the route.

Vehicular movement was disrupted with flood water flowing heavily on highways too. Following breach to causeway near Chapara, road network between Parlakimidi and Meliyaputti got disrupted. Life was thrown completely out of gear in Sompeta, Vajrapukotturu, and Kanchili areas as rain water entered houses.

The district administration tried to provide water and food packets to flood victims.

Collector Saurabh Gaur monitored the flood situation and asked all the special officers to be alert till normalcy was restored in the affected villages.

Review meet

He conducted a review meeting at the Collectorate and directed health teams to reach flood affected areas to check outbreak of prevent communicable diseases. The Collector declared holiday for schools and colleges in the district on Thursday.

Mr.Gaur said there was no human loss in the flood affected areas. However, the situation was grim in Jagannadhapuram, Patasasanam, Birlangi and Totavooru of Itchapuram mandal. The irrigation officials requested their counter parts in Odisha not to release water from Balagatti Dam since it would further inundate many areas of Itchapuram.

The situation was reportedly to be grim in Vajrapukotturu mandal as Bhimasamudram Gedda and Padmanabham Gedda are in spate. Mandasa-Haripuram villages were also badly affected.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.

Terrorism in India

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in India.

There is a heightened risk of terrorism in some Indian regions. Read our advice on regional risks in India for more information.

Terrorist and insurgent groups operating in India include:

Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LET), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM) in Kashmir

Naxalite (radical communist insurgent) groups active in India’s eastern states

Khalistani extremists operating mainly in Punjab

Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), and other groups may also be planning attacks

Terrorist attacks have mainly targeted Government of India interests. Security has been strengthened, notably at major hotels and transport hubs. However, terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreign nationals, such as:

restaurants, hotels, bars, and markets

stations and airports

places of worship and tourist attractions

festivals, sports venues, and beaches

Take particular care during periods of national or religious significance, such as:

Republic Day (26 January)

Independence Day (15 August)

Diwali (usually in October or November)

Eid (date changes each year)

Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.

Political situation

Strikes (sometimes referred to as ‘bandh’ or ‘hartal’), political rallies and demonstrations occur frequently and can become violent. The risks are higher during elections and after the death of party or government leaders. Protests may also occur at short notice, especially around days of national importance. Local authorities may impose curfews and other restrictions at short notice. Transport and public services including mobile and internet network coverage may be disrupted at short notice.

You should:

avoid protests or large gatherings, including at religious sites

follow the advice of the local authorities and your travel company

monitor local media and follow any curfew restrictions

Crime

If you’re the victim of crime, call Police helpline number 100 or National Emergency Number 112 and ask for police assistance.

India’s Women Helpline Number is 1091.

Protecting your belongings

Keep a copy of your passport, visa, and flight ticket separately from originals when travelling. Leave copies at home where others can access them, and also store them electronically so you can access them easily. If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the police immediately and get a police report.

Take particular care of your possessions on buses, trains and in crowds. Criminals may ride past on motorbikes and snatch valuables.

Be cautious in tourist areas, where scammers, pickpockets and ticket touts target foreigners.

Scams

Cybercrime, internet scamming, card skimming, and confidence scams are common. These scams come in many forms and can pose great financial loss for the victims.

Criminals often use the details of British High Commissions and embassies to carry out their fraud. Be cautious and check the authenticity of details before responding.

Drink and food spiking

As in the UK, be wary of accepting drinks or food from strangers or of leaving drinks unattended. There have been reports of spiked drinks and food, with travellers, including British nationals, subsequently being robbed, or assaulted.

Sexual assault

Sexual assaults occur. This includes attacks on foreign female visitors in tourist areas and cities.

Female travellers often experience verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. Serious sexual attacks involving both Indian and foreign nationals have been reported. British women have been victims of sexual assault, including rape, in Goa, Delhi, Rajasthan, Mumbai and Kerala. Avoid isolated areas, including beaches, when alone at any time of day.

Read our advice for women travelling abroad.

Laws and cultural differences

There may be serious legal penalties for doing something which may not be illegal in the UK.

Dress code

Women travelling in India should respect local customs and dress codes.

Alcohol laws and bans

Laws on alcohol, including buying, drinking and the legal drinking age, vary by state. Get advice from your travel agent, hotel, or the authorities about the laws in areas you are visiting.

It is an offence to drink alcohol in public places, such as public parks.

In some states, foreign nationals and non-resident Indians can buy 30-day alcohol permits.

There is often a ban on the sale of alcohol during major religious festivals, national holidays, and elections.

The consumption, production or transportation of alcohol is banned in:

Bihar

Gujarat

Mizoram

Nagaland

the region of Lakshadweep

Manipur

If you drink or possess alcohol in these states, you could be arrested without bail. Charges can carry a prison sentence of 5 to 10 years.

Smoking and e-cigarette bans

Smoking is banned in most public places. You should only smoke in designated smoking areas.

E-cigarettes and related products are banned. You will be unable to buy e-cigarettes in India or bring them into the country.

Illegal drugs and prison sentences

Do not get involved with any illegal drugs. Drugs are not categorised as they would be in the UK, into Class A, B and C. There is a minimum sentence of 6 months for possession of small amounts deemed for personal consumption only. A 10-year sentence for possession of other amounts applies. The judicial process is slow and being detained for several years whilst your case is processed is normal.

Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas

Activities involving cameras and binoculars, like photography, bird-watching, or plane spotting, may be misunderstood. Be particularly careful near military sites, government buildings, airports, and railway stations.

Swimming safety

Every year, several people drown due to strong currents in the sea. There are strong currents off many coasts. Most beaches do not have warning signs, flags, or lifesaving equipment. Take local advice, follow warnings and instructions issued by lifeguards. Emergency service standards may differ from those in the UK.

Trekking in India

Trekkers should:

travel in groups

use reputable local guides and stay on established routes

check if you need any special permits

Leave details of where you’re going and when you expect to return with your accommodation. You are extremely unlikely to have a phone signal in the mountains, so make sure your accommodation provider registers your whereabouts using the online C-form.

It is illegal to possess or operate satellite phones without prior permission of the Indian authorities.

The following hazards exist throughout the year, especially above 3,000 metres (m):

altitude sickness - see our advice on Health in India

sudden weather changes, including thunderstorms

avalanches and snow drifts

landslides, flooding, and rock falls

Make sure your insurance policy covers you for altitudes over 2,400m and mountain rescue and helicopter costs.

There are no commercial mountain rescue services operating above 3,000m. In some border areas only the Indian Air Force can carry out air rescues. However, they are under no obligation to perform them and only carry out rescues during working hours.

LGBT+ travellers

Same-sex relationships are legal in India. However same-sex marriage is still illegal. Indian society remains conservative. This includes attitudes to LGBT+ people, which can be less accepting than in the UK. There is a risk of harassment and discrimination, especially outside of big cities.

Showing affection in public can receive unwanted attention.

Read our advice for LGBT+ travellers.

Child custody and family law

Indian family law is very different from UK law. Special caution is needed when child custody becomes an issue. In case of dispute, consult a local lawyer to find out more about the relevant laws.

Commercial surrogacy is illegal for foreign nationals in India. Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) can seek legal guidance on surrogacy if at least one partner is an Indian passport holder.

Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs

It is illegal to buy, sell, kill, or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. India has a strong legal framework to regulate and restrict wildlife trade and is also a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). If you’re caught purchasing or trafficking such goods illegally, you will be prosecuted and receive a prison sentence or fine.

Sexual offences against children

The penalties for child sex offences are severe. There is a minimum jail term of 20 years, which may go up to life imprisonment, or a death sentence for those convicted of raping a child aged under 12.

Transport risks in India

Be wary of unofficial transport at airports.

British tourists have been scammed by drivers who offer cheap transportation or hotels, unwanted tours, and extended taxi rides. Travellers who accept these offers have reported being threatened with violence when they have declined to pay.

Taxis and rickshaws

When using taxis or rickshaws:

avoid travelling alone and hailing taxis on the street, especially at night

use official taxi ranks. Pre-paid taxi services are available from inside all airport terminal buildings and many hotels offer transfers. Ride-hailing services like Uber and Ola are also widely available in India

if you’re being collected at the airport by a hotel driver, make sure they properly identify themselves before you set off

if you book a taxi online, there’s usually a way to share journey details with your contacts who can then follow your location

Cars and motorbikes

Road accidents including car and motorbike accidents are one of the biggest causes of injury and death overseas. Police figures estimate more than 150,000 people are killed every year in road accidents across India. Several British nationals are either injured or killed each year on Indian roads.

Road traffic hazards include:

reckless driving and manoeuvring

poorly maintained vehicles

poor quality and congested roads

roads shared with pedestrians, carts, cattle and other livestock

vehicles running red lights

protests - see our advice on the Political Situation in India

extreme weather and natural disasters - see our advice on Extreme weather in India

Driving in India

If you are planning to drive in India, see information on driving abroad.

You can drive with a UK licence and an accompanying international driving permit after you arrive, but rules on how long you can drive on a UK licence vary from state to state.

Driving can be dangerous in urban and rural areas due to wandering livestock, including cows. Cows are considered sacred in India and road accidents involving cows can draw crowds or potentially lead to violence. If you are involved in a road accident, you may be attacked or become a victim of extortion, even if you were not driving the vehicle. If you hit a cow or pedestrian, you should comply with the police if they are at the scene. If the police are not present, it could be unsafe to remain at the scene of an accident of this nature, if safe to do so you may prefer to find the nearest police station.

It is common to use your horn or flash your headlights frequently to announce your presence on the road.

If possible, avoid travelling at night and in fog as accidents are common due to low visibility and there is a higher risk of crime at night. Always travel in a well-maintained vehicle. Seatbelts are not common in three-wheel taxis (autos) or in the back seats of taxis. Try to use only cars that have seatbelts.

If you travel by motorbike, wear a helmet and proper footwear.

Buses are a convenient mode of transport, serving almost every city across India. However, they are often driven fast and recklessly. Accidents are common.

Vehicles drive on the left in India. Pedestrians should exercise caution when crossing streets, even in marked pedestrian areas and especially at night, as vehicles sometimes drive on the wrong side of the road.

Air travel

When you are travelling through an airport, allow enough time to complete check-in and security procedures, as your baggage may need to go through screening equipment and checks. Allow time for transiting between flights if you need to change from international terminals to domestic terminals, even if using the airport shuttle service.

Tourists flying on charter flights booked through a tour operator can only fly into and out of the country by using the services of the same charter operator. Chartered flight passengers are not permitted to fly on inward or outward journeys using a scheduled airline.

Rail travel

India has a large passenger train network throughout the country. Although train travel in India is generally safe, accidents do occur and have previously resulted in death and serious injury. There are police or guards on trains and stations if you need help.

When travelling by train:

do not accept food or drinks from strangers

thefts are common - take care of your passport and valuables

avoid people at railway stations offering tickets and tours as you may be scammed

Sea travel

Tourist boats and other small crafts rarely carry life-saving equipment.

Although piracy has not so far affected India’s territorial waters, it poses a significant threat in parts of the Indian Ocean. Mariners should follow shipping industry guidelines on precautions to take.

Ships and crew must have the necessary authorisation and paperwork before entering Indian territorial waters and abide by Indian laws and regulations. If carrying weapons on board ships in Indian territorial waters, you must follow Indian laws and regulations.

Extreme weather and natural disasters

India can experience extreme weather events that can be hazardous to life and disrupt infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and communications.

Plan your travel so that you are aware of seasonal weather events, such as monsoon rains, as well as what to do if there is a natural disaster. Follow the advice of local authorities and your travel company. Consult the Indian Meteorological Department for local and international weather updates.

Monsoons

Highest risk: June to October

Monsoon rains can cause:

flooding and landslides, sometimes leading to significant loss of life

towns and villages to be cut off for days

serious disruption to road and train travel

disruption in big cities due to flooding

other services including telephone lines, internet services and electricity supply to be affected

Cyclones and tropical storms

Highest risk:

East coast of India (September to December)

Bay of Bengal (April to June and September to December)

South India (June to November)

Tropical cyclones can cause:

high winds: buildings can be damaged or destroyed, trees, power and telephone lines toppled, flying debris can be dangerous

storm surges: can provoke a temporary rise in sea level of several metres which can flood coastal areas and damage buildings on the shoreline

very heavy rainfall: this can cause localised or widespread flooding and mudslides

See our advice on Extreme weather and natural hazards for more information.

Earthquakes

Several parts of India lie on highly active fault zones (including areas of the North and North-east). The most active are along the length of the Himalayas. Earth tremors are common in these regions and can cause landslides. Limited emergency response vehicles, equipment, and medical facilities could increase the impact an earthquake has.

In a statement made after an aerial survey of the hilly regions of the State, where torrential rains wreaked havoc and caused extensive damage in the past few days, Dr. Singh said he had directed all Central agencies to render all possible assistance in their capacity to the State. UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi accompanied the Prime Minister during the aerial survey.

Dr. Singh announced ex-gratia assistance of Rs. 2 lakh each to the families of those killed and Rs. 50,000 each to those who injured from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF).

Further, the Centre would provide from the PMNRF ex-gratia assistance of Rs.1 lakh each to those whose houses were completely destroyed and Rs. 50,000 each to those whose houses were damaged.

“We saw for ourselves the large scale devastation that has been caused in the State. Our hearts go out to the families of those who have lost their lives and those who have suffered injury or loss of property in this huge tragedy,” the Prime Minister said. The priority for the authorities was to rescue the stranded persons and provide relief to the affected people.

“Assessing the magnitude of the losses, both in terms of lives lost and houses destroyed, or the damage to buildings, roads and other infrastructure, is an exercise that will take some more time,” he said. Dr. Singh added that both he and Ms. Gandhi were distressed by the devastation caused by flash floods and rains.

While estimates put the death toll at 102, it was feared that loss of lives could be much higher. So far, more than 10,000 people had been rescued and were being provided food, clothing and shelter. Many persons were still stranded. The maximum damage was in Kedarnath and its vicinity, Dr. Singh noted.

The Central and State governments would continue to work in close coordination to ensure that every possible effort was made, not only to provide immediate relief to the affected people, but also to help them reconstruct their lives, Dr. Singh said.",solution,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 20, 2013","['Kedarnath', 'Rudraprayag', 'Chamoli', 'Pithoragarh', 'Uttarkashi']","['Kedarnath: 300 mm', 'Rudraprayag: 250 mm', 'Chamoli: 200 mm', 'Pithoragarh: 150 mm', 'Uttarkashi: 100 mm']","['10,000 houses destroyed', '100 bridges damaged', '13,000 km of roads damaged', '102 people killed']",,"['Thousands of people stranded', 'Major disruption to transportation', 'Loss of livelihoods', 'Environmental damage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

It is one week since Uttarakhand’s worst disaster in living memory. Flash floods resulting from extremely intense rainfall swept away mountainsides, villages and towns, thousands of people, animals, agricultural fields, irrigation canals, domestic water sources, dams, roads, bridges, and buildings — anything that stood in the way.

A week later, media attention remains riveted on the efforts to rescue tens of thousands of pilgrims and tourists visiting the shrines in the uppermost reaches of Uttarakhand’s sacred rivers. But the deluge spread far beyond the Char Dhams — Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath — to cover the entire State. The catchments of many smaller rivers also witnessed flash floods but the media has yet to report on the destruction there. Eyewitness accounts being gathered by official agencies and voluntary organisations have reported devastation from more than 200 villages so far and more affected villages are being reported every day. Villagers whose homes, lands and animals have been swept away by the floods are in a state of shock trying to imagine day-to-day survival without their basic livelihood assets.

Distorted coverage

The national media’s focus on the plight of tourists has grossly distorted the true nature of the tragedy even in the Char Dham area. It has not reported on the fate of the thousands — almost all male — who come from the villages in these valleys (and elsewhere) to earn a major part of their families’ annual income on the yatra routes during the tourist season. They help run the dhabas that line the entire 14 km trek route from GauriKund to Kedarnath; they sell raincoats, umbrellas, canes, walking sticks, soft drinks, water bottles, home-made snacks and other supplies. On their backs, they carry children, the old, the infirm and tourists who are simply unfit and out of shape to walk the entire route. They run along the path with their ponies or horses carrying yatris.

Local residents tell of village after village in the Mandakini valley below Kedarnath resounding with wails from homes whose boys and men have not yet returned and are now feared dead. One village near Guptkashi alone counts 78 missing.

The tragedy of the families dependent on religious tourism for much of their annual income is compounded by the fact that the yatra season is over for the year, and is unlikely to resume even next year given the destruction of the roads and bridges in the upper reaches. Several thousand Char Dham valley families will now fall below the poverty line. Till the revival of the yatras, what will be the alternative sources of employment for the newly unemployed? Most likely we will see increased male outmigration from the region.

Last week’s disaster not only spelt doom for thousands of household economies but also dealt a grievous blow to Uttarakhand’s lucrative religious tourism industry. With the media focus almost exclusively on the fate of pilgrims, the scenes of the deluge and its aftermath will linger on in public memory, making the revival of tourism doubtful in the foreseeable future. The abject failure of the State government, political leaders and the administration is therefore likely to impoverish the State coffers too.

The scale of participation in the kaanwar festival that starts in July — when about a million people throng to the banks of the Ganga at Hardwar over a couple of weeks and take back Gangajal to their homes — will be revealing. The pressure on the State government will continue through September when the Nanda Devi Raj Jaat (yatra), a once-in-12-years event, is scheduled. A detailed discussion on the future of Uttarakhand’s tourism industry is not possible here but it is clear that it requires a radical overhaul. With the ineptness of the State government now fully exposed, new policies for the revival of tourism in Uttarakhand must follow an open debate.

Not a ‘freak’ incident

The impact of the floods on Uttarakhand’s tourism leads to larger questions of what kind of development Himalayan States should pursue. Before delving into that, it is important to understand the nature of the rainfall that deluged the State. Already several voices are arguing that the deluge is a random, ‘freak’ event. Odisha’s super cyclone in 1999, torrential rains in Mumbai in 2005, and now the Uttarakhand downpour constitute three clear weather related events in less than 15 years, each causing massive destruction or dislocation in India. These can hardly be called ‘freak’ events.

Several reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have repeatedly warned that extreme weather incidents will become more frequent with global warming. We are already riding the global warming curve. We will have to take into account the likelihood of more frequent extreme weather events when planning for development, especially in the fragile Himalayan region where crumbling mountains become murderous.

In the 1990s, when the demand for a separate State gained momentum, at conferences, meetings, workshops and seminars, Uttarakhandi people repeatedly described the special character of the region. Consciousness created by the pioneering Chipko Andolan raised the hopes of village women that their new State would pursue a green development path, where denuded slopes would be reforested, where fuel wood and fodder would be plentiful in their own village forests, where community ownership of these forests would provide their men with forest products-based employment near their villages instead of forcing them to migrate to the plains, where afforestation and watershed development would revive their dry springs and dying rain-fed rivers, and where the scourge of drunken, violent men would be overcome.

Year after year — in cities, towns and villages — they led demonstrations demanding a mountain state of their own. Theirs was a vision of development that would first enhance the human, social and natural capital of the State. Recalling the tremendous worldwide impact of the Chipko movement, Uttarakhandi women dreamed of setting yet another example for the world of what people-centric development could look like.

But in the 13 years after statehood, the leadership of the State has succumbed to the conventional model of development with its familiar and single-minded goal of creating monetary wealth. With utter disregard for the State’s mountain character and its delicate ecosystems, successive governments have blindly pushed roads, dams, tunnels, bridges and unsafe buildings even in the most fragile regions.

In the process, denuded mountains have remained deforested, roads designed to minimise expenditure rather than enhance safety have endangered human lives, tunnels blasted into mountainsides have further weakened the fragile slopes and dried up springs, ill-conceived hydropower projects have destroyed rivers and their ecosystems, and hotels and land developers have encroached on river banks.

Yes, wealth has been generated but the beneficiaries are very few — mainly in the towns and cities of the southern terai plains and valleys where production investments have concentrated. In the mountain villages, agricultural production has shrivelled, women still trudge the mountain slopes in search of fodder, fuel wood and water, and entire families wait longingly for an opportunity to escape to the plains.

Last week’s floods have sounded an alarm bell. To pursue development without concern for the fragile Himalayan environment is to invite disaster. Eco-sensitive development may mean a slower monetary growth rate but a more sustainable and equitable one.

Several low-lying areas along the Yamuna were flooded on Wednesday as water rose to unprecedented levels reaching 207.2 metres at the Old Railway Bridge. A statement from the Chief Minister’s office also noted that a person taking bath at Majanu Ka Tila drowned in the Yamuna and his body is yet to be recovered.

The Delhi Government deployed all its personnel and resources for rescue and relief measures while Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit visited camps set up in various areas such as Mayur Vihar Phase-I, DND flyover and along L.M. Bandh.

Ms. Dikshit noted that the highest ever quantity of water has been released from Hathini Kund this year and that her administration was on the alert and ready to respond as per the situation. She interacted with the flood-affected people and advised them not to panic as the government has taken adequate measures. Till date 400 people have been rescued while 5,000 have been evacuated and provided shelters at 19 camps. Further, 62 boats and adequate number of divers have been deployed.

While the Delhi Government has stated that low-lying areas may face disruption in power supply and the administration is taking steps to repair the lines, discom sources said the Delhi Government has asked them to restrict electricity supply to certain low-lying areas as a precautionary measure. Some of the affected areas inclue Vishkarma Colony, Jaitpur and Dhobi Ghat. Discom sources said 82 power connections have been suspended in the Badarpur Khader area falling in the Karawal Nagar division while 172 connections have been switched off in low lying areas of Garhi Mandu, Usmanpur, Gurudwara and Bela farm areas. On Delhi Jal Board request , connections to two ranney wells each in Lakshmi Nagar and Krishna Nagar divisions have been disconnected.

In addition, the city government has asked the Army to be on alert for helping the civil administration if required. The river crossed the danger level of 204.83 m on Tuesday morning, prompting authorities to evacuate around 2,000 people from various low-lying areas in East Delhi like Usmanpur, Yamuna Bazar, Bhajanpura and Shastri Park and set up relief camps for their shelter.

Tungabhadra river received the first flood of the season on Monday. The inflow into the Sunkesula reservoir near Kurnool was recorded at 22,000 cusecs.

As the reservoir attained the full level, the officials operated five gates and discharged 21,000 cusecs into the river. The reservoir stocked 1.02 tmcft and also released 230 cusecs to the KC canal.

According to reports, the river was witnessing a flood in the first week of June after a decade. The catchment area below the Tungabhadra dam at Hospet received copious rains in the past few days.

Hagari river, a tributary of Tungabhadra contributed the flood to the main river. The catchment falling in Hagari area receives good rains in the beginning of the season and at the fag end of the season. The irrigation officials said the flood would resolve the drinking water problem for the season.

Reopening of the canals would not be possible with moderate rain fall in the limited catchment area. The river flow stabilises only after the Tungabhadra dam attains the full level. The RDS officials said the anicut overflowed at Rajolibanda upstream of Sunkesula reservoir.

The flood is expected to sustain for a few days.

Technology-driven efforts are on to crowdsource information using the Internet and other communication channels and integrate it into online maps to help manage the aftermath of the natural calamity that has beset Uttarakhand.

The international experience in recent years has proved that ‘crisis mapping’ can make a difference to disaster situations.

One such Uttarakhand flood relief effort, that aims to make use of ‘digital volunteers’ in India and other parts of the world to aggregate information from diverse sources and make it more useful and actionable has been launched by Hemant Purohit, a Crisis-Response Coordination researcher at the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis), Wright State University.

And there exists an International Network of Crisis Mappers, which includes members with different skill sets, and experience in the use of tools covering crowdsourcing, mapping, use of aerial and satellite imagery, geospatial platforms, advanced visualisation and computational and statistical models.

What the volunteers are doing is to monitor different channels of information on Uttarakhand, including official sources, blogs, social media, non-governmental organisations, public networks and the news media to generate ‘situation reports’ and also update with vital information an online crisis map set up by the >Google Crisis Response team (http://google.org/crisismap/2013-uttrakhand-floods? gl=in). The map has information on rescued people, cleared areas, people stranded, relief camps, medical centres, road networks and so on.

Information flow will gather momentum as the repair and restoration of the mobile phone network progresses in Uttarakhand.

Google had also set up an instance of its webapp, Person Finder, that makes it possible for information about missing persons to be posted online and searched, with the option of triggering alerts.

The role of crisis mapping was to bridge the gap that existed between information-seekers and providers, particularly when it came to providing insights into the situation on the ground and the action that needed to be taken, Mr. Purohit said in an e-mail interview to The Hindu .

Haiti earthquake

The world got a glimpse of the potential of crowdsourced mapping following the deployment of an open-source platform called Ushahidi when an earthquake hit Haiti in 2010. The information provided by the affected population and others over the Internet and the mobile phone network and the map-based capabilities of the platform helped in addressing specific disaster management requirements.

In the case of the Haiti earthquake, a volunteer team got the platform going fast and were soon tapping into social media sources like Twitter, facebook, and blogs and other media to create actionable reports. Later an international SMS number was created for people to input information relating to the quake. Soon it turned into a flood which was painstakingly processed by volunteers and turned into information that could be loaded onto an online map.

As many as 4,636 project volunteers translated 25,186 SMSs and numerous e-mails, web, and social media communications, resulting in 3,596 reports that were actionable and included enough relevant information to be mapped on Ushahidi, said a United States Institute of Peace report.

Now the trend was to try to use automation to process such large volumes of information.

“Until recently, much of our crisis response and disaster coordination relied on manual effort using web infrastructure. Ushahidi is an excellent and successful example. More recently, there is rapid progress on our ability to use automation — especially in processing large amount of information shared on social media,” said Amit P. Sheth, director, Kno.e.sis Center. “We are at a stage where we should combine human effort with machine processing,” he said.",solution,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 28, 2013",Uttarakhand,200 mm,USD 3 billion,"5,700","Destruction of infrastructure, loss of livelihoods, displacement of people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

But the situation could get difficult if the rains continue for a few more days,"" GVMC chief engineer B Jayarami Reddy told TOI.However, what is giving the residents of these 13 localities nightmares is the spectre of a repeat of the 2005 incident when flooding due to heavy rains brought the Meghadrigedda waters rushing into several homes and also brought the airport services to a grinding halt for nearly 15 days. In that year, nearly 53,000 cusecs of water of the reservoir, which was commissioned in December 1977, was released into the sea at Naval Dockyard.According to Kona Thatha Rao, former GVMC corporator and resident of Gajuwaka, every rainy season people living in areas such as Vizag Airport, Gajuwaka, Sheelanagar, Kunchumamba Colony, Yerragedda Colony, PN Colony and Narava, Yellapuvanipalem live under the constant threat of floods due to the rising water levels of the Meghadrigedda.Attributing the rising water levels to the poor maintenance of the reservoir, he said the civic authorities have not taken up maintenance works in the last four years. ""Meghadrigedda will not overflow if the GVMC annually takes up maintenance works such as removal of mud, slush and weeds. If it does so, the reservoir's storing capacity will also increase apart from preventing flood like situations in residential localities,"" Thatha Rao said.Spanning an area of 1041.86 million cubic feet, though the Meghadrigedda is one of the smaller water bodies out of the total eight canals and reservoirs that feed the city, it poses a higher risk to public life in case of heavy rains. The Meghadrigedda, that gives GVMC 9 million gallons of water per day, is a prime water source due to continuous rains in its catchment areas, mostly the hill ranges of Narava and Yerrakonda in the Eastern Ghats.GVMC commissioner, MV Satyanarayana said they have already alerted the residents of the residential areas at risk due to the swelling reservoir and urged them to take the help of GVMC. ""We have so far evacuated nearly 100 families to safer places as part of preventive measures,"" civic chief said.When contacted, GVMC superintending engineer for water works D Mariyanna said that they annually pay Rs 20 lakh to the state irrigation department for maintenance works, including removal of mud and silt. ""We have appealed to the government to hand over the reservoir to GVMC for maintenance but have not received any official reply from the government till date,"" he said, adding that they can increase its storage capacity from the present 0.5 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) to 1 TMC by taking up proper maintenance works.According to Mariyanna, none of the other seven water sources of GVMC affects any of the residential localities. However, like Meghadrigedda, the remaining GVMC water sources are also running close to danger levels at present, GVMC sources said.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

""The NDRF ( National Disaster Management Force ) is engaged in a grim battle to evacuate the flood-hit people who are still trapped in marooned villages. Besides, 54 boats, including 17 hired ones, are engaged in rescue operation,"" he said.As the surging waters of swollen rivers are penetrating and devastating village after village, the entire area now lies under vast sheet of flood water.

Fodder for cattle heads is still another poignant problem in three blocks under Baisi sub-division in Purnia district , sources said.Baisi BJP MLA Santosh Kushwaha, describing the overall flood situation as grim, called for dropping of food packets from choppers and adequate arrangement for drinking water as over 90% of the households as well as tubewells in the sub-division are under flood water, and drinking water had become scare.In Katihar district, the river Mahananda, already in high spate and flowing much above the danger mark , is virtually keeping the engineers on their tenterhooks. Efforts are underway on war footing to protect the two embankments on the river Mahananda which is ferociously threatening to breach the embankments at various points, official sources said.Mahananda divisional superintending engineer ( SE ) Siya Ram Paswan, talking to TOI on Friday, said, ""The engineers and others are pulling out all stops to protect and safeguard the embankments, and plug all the possible loopholes alongside the embankmentsadding , however, no breach has taken place so far"".Any breach in the embankments could spell a huge disaster and monstrosity of floods could sweep vast parts of the perennially flood-prone district, informed sources said, showing great deal of anxiety.The overall flood situation across the districts of Supaul , Madhepura and Saharsa, is still worrying engineers and civil authorities.

In Odisha’s Ganjam district, where Cyclone Phailin made its landfall on Saturday evening, at least 200,000 houses and over 200,000 hectares of agricultural land have been damaged, making it the state’s worst casualty of the storm. Also, about 40 power transmission towers were uprooted by the cyclone, leaving most of the district without electricity and putting the national grid at strain.

Balasore, Mayurbhanj, Jajpur, Keojhar and Bhadrak districts in the state are flooded, and power distribution systems and grids have been severely damaged in many places, especially in Ganjam, by the severest cyclone to hit the country in several years, state government officials said.

Overall, 13 districts in Odisha were affected by the storm.

The flood situation is grim in Balasore and Mayurbhanj, special relief commissioner of Odisha, P.K. Mohapatra, said over the phone from Bhubaneswar, the state capital. Three teams of National Disaster Response Force and teams of the Orissa Disaster Response Action Force have been dispatched to the most affected areas, he said.

Cyclone Phailin lashed India’s eastern coast at Gopalpur in Ganjam district with wind speeds of up to 220km per hour around 7.30pm on Saturday, bringing heavy rains across south coastal Odisha and Srikakulam district of north coastal Andhra Pradesh.

Twenty-one people died and 11.9 million people have been affected by the cyclone and the ensuing floods in 128 blocks of the state, according to state administration.

Defence agencies have been pressed into action to airdrop food packets in flood-hit areas. In Balasore district, around 300,000 people are locked by floodwater.

Several areas in Odisha received very heavy rainfall of more than 150mm on Sunday. Balimundali village and Banki town received rainfall of over 350mm on Sunday. On Monday morning, the National Disaster Management Authority warned that Burhabalang river at the National Highway (NH) 5 Road Bridge in Balasore district of Odisha was flowing in “high flood situation"".

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a “high flood situation"" warning was issued by the Cyclone Warning Centre for the Burhabalang at the NH-5 Road Bridge in Balasore district as it flowed 1.08m above its danger level on Monday.

“Very heavy rainfall can be expected in the plains of Bihar, over north Jharkhand, including Kosi and Gandak river catchments, in the next 24 hours,"" said L.S. Rathore, director general, IMD.

IMD in its latest bulletin added that sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim would also face very heavy rainfall for the next two days, including in the Teesta river catchment. West Bengal could face wind speeds of up to 74km per hour, in gusts, in the next 24 hours.

After heavy rainfall for the next two days, rainfall will start decreasing at many places over Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Gangetic West Bengal. IMD had issued a flood warning for Bihar on Sunday.

In Odisha, while operations at Bhubaneswar airport were resumed and the air traffic control was functioning at its optimum level, Indian Railways suffered an estimated loss of ₹ 12 crore due to the suspension of 165 train services to Odisha and Andhra Pradesh between Saturday and Sunday.

Air India Ltd said it has resumed its schedule, and all flights of private airlines are operating without changes.

“All operations are normal. We have operated three flights already. A fourth one is scheduled as per original schedule,"" an Air India spokesman said.

Some trains services have now been resumed. In addition to the Puri-Howrah section that was opened on Sunday, trains services on the Khundra road-Berhampur- Palasa-Srikakulam-Vishakhapatnam route were also restored, effectively restoring all train services from South India and Mumbai to Bhubaneswar.

While there is not much clarity on the damage to the rail infrastructure, a railway official, who did not want to be named, said: “We do not see significant damage to rail infrastructure.""

The health department in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha maintained that rapid response teams were taking stock of the situation in real time. In the worst-affected districts, the primary health concern is to ensure access to potable water, said G.V.S. Murthy, director of the Indian Institute of Public Health in Hyderabad.

“The government has an extensive mechanism in place, ensuring access to clean water, food and shelter. There has been minimal loss of livestock in the three worst-affected districts in AP (Andhra Pradesh). Our first worry is outbreak of diarrhoea. We do not have a threat of epidemics as yet,"" said the public health specialist.

“The state government has set up a committee to look at emerging public health concerns. Once water starts receding in these areas, the stagnation could lead to vector borne disease in the next few weeks. It is too early to address that aspect now. The hospitals have not shown any spikes in cases of diarrhoea either, which means people have access to safe drinking water,"" he said.

Large parts of Odisha are without electricity, leading to a blackout in 3,229 villages across Ganjam, which is spread over 8,070.6 sq. km. While the national electricity grid withstood the torrential aftermath of the cyclone, India is trying to cope with a sharp drop in electricity demand and its impact on the grid. This sharp fall in demand has strained the national grid network. The load is still under 100,000 megawatts (MW) from peak demand of around 127,000MW, according to officials managing the country’s electricity grid.

“Ganjam has been worst affected. Around 40 transmission towers have been uprooted. It will take a while for the supply to be restored in these areas,"" said a senior Power System Operation Corp. Ltd (Posoco) official requesting anonymity.

Load management functions are overseen by state-owned Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd (PGCIL) and carried out by its subsidiary Posoco. Regional load despatch centres are responsible for maintaining grid discipline and supervising optimum scheduling and delivery of electricity in their regions, and function under Posoco.

“All necessary facilities will be restored in almost all districts by Monday night, but Ganjam will take few more days as it was severely battered. We are on top of the situation and are monitoring it at the highest level,"" said Odisha’s special relief commissioner Mohapatra.

""Substantial damage to the 33/11kV distribution network in the coastal districts is reported,"" the Union power ministry said in a statement.

While PGCIL’s networks are fine, the electricity demand in the eastern region including Odisha has dropped, with the state’s load being only 1,400MW. Odisha has an installed power generation capacity of 4,682.1MW including the state’s share in central and joint projects. The state had an electricity demand of 3,448MW in August during peak consumption hours—normally between 8am and 11am, and 6.30pm and 10pm.

“Yesterday, we had taken a link out as a precautionary measure, but it was restored in a short while. While Odisha’s load is down, the load in the grid is also short by around 9,000MW due to the rainfall across the eastern region that has reduced demand. The demand is less than 100,000MW. Orissa’s state distribution network has been impacted,"" said the official quoted above.

“Our systems are intact,"" said PGCIL chairman and managing director R.N. Nayak.

Officials are still closely monitoring the grid as the eastern grid that supplies electricity to Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Sikkim and West Bengal is inter-connected to the national grid. Of the five regional grids in the country—northern, southern, eastern, north-eastern and western—all except the southern one are interconnected.

“As required, load and generation were managed in a balanced manner so as to secure stable transmission frequency. Load was not much affected in AP (about 9,000MW against normal demand of 10,000MW). In Odisha, it was reduced to 22-25%, about 600MW (normal demand is 2,800MW),"" the Union power ministry said.

“Interruptions in the Talcher-Kolar HVDC link at 3 locations around 23 hours/01.19 hours on 12.10.13/13.10.13, were restored in very short time of less than 30 minutes. Also, the southern connection was maintained through the alternate path of 1,000MW Gazuwaka HVDC back to back link. No AC PGCIL line tripped. However, up to seven lines of 400kV, 17 lines of 220kV and 19 lines of 132kV have been affected concerning the state grid. This affected the power supply in the state,"" the statement added.

The national highway between Dehradun and Srinagar is currently broken at Byasi and Devprayag, with silt measuring upto 10 ft. covering an enormous area, in Uttarakhand’s Pauri district.

According to the residents of Shakti Vihar, an area in Srinagar, this disaster occurred on June 17 at around 3.00 a.m. when the Srinagar dam authorities lifted the dam gates.

Ajay Uniyal, a resident, said, “The rainfall on June 16 was so much that the water reached up to our knees, and to add to it, the dam authorities released water without a prior warning.”

Mr. Uniyal said the silt was from the debris lying around the dam construction site. “The water swept all the debris lying around the dam construction site and deposited it here.”

Ritu Raj Singh, another resident, said, “Such an incident happened at Bhaktiyana in 1971 as well, but that year only water filled the area and everything became fine once the water level receded.”

According to the residents, the water level this time was three to four metres higher than the previous floods.

Aradhana Negi, a resident of Bhaktiyana, said, “People, whose houses have been destroyed, are taking shelter in some houses uphill and in some government guest houses while their belongings [whatever remain)]are lying on the terrace of their respective silt-filled houses.”

Pradeep Mal, another resident of the area, said, “Though residents were saved, cattle were killed under the silt.”

“Quintals of fish that was the river brought along are also rotting under the debris,” said Mr. Mal.

Every person passing by the site could smell the rotten flesh. “This can cause disease but the authorities have not yet bothered to take any action,” said Ms. Negi.

A Services Selection Board (SSB) Academy, a gas godown, a ration godown, a silk farm, hundreds of houses, vehicles, and animals were affected by the massive flashfloods that hit Srinagar.

Ms. Negi said, “Every year the river water enters the houses that are near it. People complain, but the authorities do not bother to take action. Then monsoons end and people too become silent on the issue.”

521,521,mumbai,2013,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/when-the-ganga-descends/article4857510.ece,28 Jun 2013,When the Ganga descends,"June 28, 2013 02:03 am | Updated June 29, 2013 02:11 am IST

Had the elemental fury of flash floods not rained down on Uttarakhand last week, June 18 (June 19, according to some almanacs), would have been a day of festivity and ritual for Hindu devotes across north India. They would have relived the mythology of the Ganga’s descent from heaven to earth with a dip in its waters at various pilgrimage centres.

Ganga Dussehra – celebrated on the tenth day of the waxing moon in the third month of the Hindu almanac – usually coincides with the opening up of ice-bound holy sites such as Kedarnath, Badrinath, and Gangotri.

This time, however, the sweeping devastation along the banks of the Ganga in Uttarakhand, with Kedarnath feeling its full force, swiftly transformed the mood from celebration to mourning.

In the midst of so much grief, how do we reflect on the mythology of Ganga’s descent in a way that it enables us to comprehend a tragedy of this magnitude, and perhaps relearn a relationship between human and nature that is life-affirming. For that to happen, it is necessary to look beyond the veil of ritual surrounding this myth. At its core, this mythology is made up of aspects which have been integral to people’s ways of life in mountains, lived in full awareness of the towering presence of nature.

Two narratives

The myth of Ganga’s descent contains two very different narratives. The first part is a narrative of power. At its simplest, the story of Ganga’s descent starts on a note of hubris, with a proud king called Sagara whose ambition is to conquer the world. As it becomes clear that there are few to rival Sagara, the gods above intervene. Sagara’s 60,000 arrogant sons (all born of one of his wives) are reduced to ash by the wrath of sage Kapila for having disrupted his meditation. King Sagara dies of grief. For his sons, now mere heaps of impure ash, there is no salvation for generations on end.

Then, Bhagiratha (descended from the son of Sagara’s second wife) ascends the throne, and from here the narrative of the myth changes track. Deeply stirred by the fate of his ancestors, he leaves his throne to undergo two long and increasingly severe penances in the Himalayas. The gods are pleased. Thus Ganga descends from heaven to be caught in the locks of Shiva, who alone can withstand her tempestuous force.

Bhagiratha performs his third penance, whereupon Shiva releases Ganga in several streams. Ganga follows Bhagiratha across mountains, forests and plains to the end of the world where his ancestors’ remains lie. Midway, the wilful Ganga scatters sage Jahnu’s sacrificial offerings and he swallows her up in rage. Bhagiratha performs one more penance to have her released yet again, showing enormous reserves of persistence.

Finally, Bhagiratha leads her to his ancestors’ ashes at Ganga Sagar. Having purified their ashes and paved their way to heaven, Ganga disappears into the ocean.

Origins of a name

That’s how the originating head stream of the Ganga gets its name Bhagirathi, say people, the other major headstream of the Ganga being the Alaknanda. These two headstreams, nourished by several others (such as the Mandakini, flowing alongside Kedarnath) come together as the Ganga, which flows across the plains until it reaches the Bay of Bengal.

The myth of Ganga’s descent resonates at different levels in the lives of the people of Uttarakhand. At one level, the story of Ganga getting tangled in Shiva’s locks or inexplicably disappearing seems entirely believable in a geological landscape that has seen rivers changing course, or getting blocked — swallowed by tectonic disturbances.

In a wonderfully layered article written in 1994, well-known writer, poet and cultural theorist Pria Devi pointed out an interesting ecological aspect of Ganga Dussehra: “It falls at the leanest moment in the annual cycle of the river, at the precise moment when, before the rains, she begins to swell with snowmelt at her source.” It is as if the Ganga comes down from the heavens every year.

At another level, this story provides the alluvium of cultural resources for a society to shape its ecology of existence. That is, if one stays connected to its core. Thus, in a land where nature resists all attempts at ‘domination’ or ‘subjugation’, it is Bhagiratha, not Sagara with his goal of world conquest, who emerges as a heroic figure, articulating a different narrative of power. The qualities emblematic of this valorous figure: his ‘powers’ of persistence, humility, and selflessness.

Pria Devi puts it succinctly: “What distinguishes Bhagiratha and explains his great popularity as a culture hero, is his non-violence, and his remarkable patience. He is quite clear about means and ends. His ends are selfless. It is not his own moksha that he seeks. Equally, he will not seek his ends by applying his will outwardly as a force.

He turns inwards....By the integrity of his self-government he compels outward sanction to his inner motives.” This strand of cultural memory can be a potent resource for resistance, for it implies that notions of conquest – of humans or nature – be replaced by the idea of conquest of the self and its excess appetites, whether it is an individual, or society.

Cultural memory

Like a river this cultural memory flows through space and time — now a subterranean existence, now a rapid current over ground. And when it does surface, it lays bare civilisational faultlines such as an exclusionary narrative of power impervious to the political ecology of inclusive instincts. In post-independence India, this cultural memory surfaced in the 1970s to herald a new phase of protest — environmental resistance — that one might term a ‘Bhagiratha prayas’ (the Hindi equivalent for Herculean effort). This phase was accompanied by the articulation of a whole new discourse of Constitutional guarantees such as equality and citizenship emerging from the margins of the Republic, from the Narmada valley to present-day Niyamgiri hills.

In Uttarakhand, too, the past four decades have seen noteworthy movements of environmental resistance built on this principle, such as the 1970s Chipko movement spearheaded by village women like Gaura Devi, which is considered India’s first green movement. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Gandhian activist and environmentalist Sunderlal Bahuguna through long fasts, and many others such as Professor Vinod K. Gaur and other experts of Himalayan geology, questioned the long term impact of big dams such as Tehri (built on the Bhagirathi), on the fragile ecological balance of the Uttarakhand region. As for the Ganga, listed among the 10 most endangered rivers of the world by the Worldwide Fund for Nature, it still awaits the collective conscience of a Bhagiratha to come back to life.

Role of greed

The qualities symbolised by Bhagiratha also exist as part of larger contemporary discourses, when we speak of sustainable development, disparities within nations and between hemispheres, or limiting consumption by putting a leash on gluttony.

The story of Bhagiratha and Ganga is as relevant today, if not more. As news filters in of the near totality of nature’s devastation in Uttarakhand, it is becoming clear that humans have played their part in exacerbating the sheer scale of the disaster in terms of lives lost and property destroyed. Unchecked construction and increasing encroachment on the flood plains of the Ganga to accommodate more and more residential buildings, hotels and tourist rest houses in the name of development, have extracted a huge human cost for a Sagara-like conquest of the environment.

Similarly, in the aftermath of the 1991 Uttarkashi earthquake, experts had pointed to the man-made factors responsible for large-scale destruction: the explosion of inappropriate building techniques and materials in the march to ‘modern progress’ frequently accompanied with a disdainful neglect of local wisdom. Over the years the nature of protest may have changed, but the issues of entrenched interests vis-a-vis forest, mineral and water resources still remain; on the contrary, they have become more acute.

Due to a range of factors, the catastrophe which brought forth a terrifying side to the Ganga not witnessed in recent times, occurred around the time of Ganga Dussehra.

Yet seen in conjunction, the disaster and the mythology seem to be pointing to the same truth: ritual observance on an appointed day may be important, but is certainly not enough. It is equally significant to internalise the essential spirit and reality of the story of Bhagiratha and Ganga, and, for that, the pact between the self-reflexive human and nature needs to be revived.

For three days running, there was no reaction from the Bharatiya Janata Party to reports that the Gujarat Chief Minister, Narendra Modi, had evacuated ‘15,000 Gujaratis’ from Uttarakhand in the course of a two-day visit to the hill State. But with doubts growing over how such a feat was achieved, if it was achievable at all, the party finally broke its silence on Wednesday. BJP president Rajnath Singh said he had spoken to Mr. Modi who denied making any such claim. Mr. Singh also wondered at the source for the figure of 15,000. “Where did this come from”? he asked.

The journalist who first wrote the story with the ‘15,000 Gujarati pilgrims’ claim has come out with the answer. He said the figure emerged from Mr. Singh’s party, the BJP, itself. Anand Soondas — chief of the National News Features of Times of India (TOI), and Editor, Sunday Times — told The Hindu that his source for the figure was Anil Baluni, the BJP’s spokesperson in Haldwani in Uttarakhand.

Mr. Soondas said the conversation between him and Mr. Baluni had taken place in “the presence of Uttarakhand BJP president, Tirath Singh Rawat, a bunch of youth leaders from Gujarat and a couple of bureaucrats from Gujarat.” Mr. Soondas said he had asked them if they were sure if all those taken back were Gujaratis, and the answer was in the affirmative. Mr. Baluni is quoted in the story as saying, “It’s amazing what he (Modi) has done here.”

The Hindu called Mr. Baluni to confirm if he had indeed given the story to Mr. Soondas but he first asked to be called later and then switched off the phone. He was unreachable till late in the evening.

Headlined, “Narendra Modi lands in Uttarakhand, flies out with 15,000 Gujaratis’, Mr Soondas’s story had appeared in The Times of India on June 23. The story made many claims in addition to the rescue of 15,000 pilgrims. Among them: requisitioning of four Boeings and 80 Toyota Innovas by Mr. Modi towards passage of the rescued pilgrims; air-dropping of a complete medical team on Hardwar; and setting up of camps across the flood-hit areas.

The Gujarat Chief Minister’s supporters greeted the news in jubilation, citing it as proof of his super-managerial skills, and saying that the performance of the Centre, the Uttarakhand Government, and even the Armed Forces, had paled in comparison. BJP office-bearers hailed Mr. Modi’s effort as a model to be emulated by the Centre and other States.

But soon, criticism started on two grounds. The first punctured the ‘15,000’ figure, with several reports showing how it was logistically impossible to conduct such an ‘evacuation’ operation in the limited time span and in the prevailing weather conditions. Others pointed out that even if true, the act of only rescuing Gujaratis, did not enhance the image of a prime ministerial aspirant. It was after this that Rajnath Singh stepped in and questioned the veracity of the story.

Mr. Soondas was unfazed by criticism that he had not exercised due diligence in presenting the 15,000 figure as fact. He said: “I believe rescuing 15,000 people over four days is actually possible since it refers to providing them food, transport, logistics.” He defended the pitch of the story, and argued: “It is not possible to say everything in the introduction. The headline seems to have brought a sharper focus to the story.”

In the past few days, a spate of new stories and blogs — sourced to Gujarat government officials — have made fresh claims about Mr. Modi’s rescue efforts in Uttarakhand and praised him for showing the way forward in disaster management.

Over two months after Kedarnath shrine was ravaged by devastating floods in Uttarakhand, efforts are on in full swing to ensure that prayers resume by September 11 as planned even as priests say that much will depend on weather conditions.

“Preparations are going on. There is a meeting on August 25 in Dehradun to take a final call on whether the prayers can begin on the proposed date as we have to consider the weather conditions also. Everyone wants that prayers begin as early as possible,” Rawal Bhimshankar Ling, the chief priest of Kedarnath told PTI from Devangere, Karnataka.

Uttarakhand chief minister Vijay Bahuguna had announced earlier this month that prayers will resume from September 11.

A 40-member team consisting of PWD and revenue department personnel reached Kedarnath this week to expedite debris removal exercise and complete other arrangements even as most places across the state were lashed by light to moderate rains.

“Prayers will be held with all the rituals. We will perform a purification prayer first which will include havan.

After that the traditional prayer will begin under the guidance of priests,” said the priest who is in Kanavkuppi math in Devangere, Karnataka for ‘shravan rudrabhishek’ which is dedicated to those who died in Kedarnath tragedy this year.

“Many people want to see the prayers but we have to keep the weather conditions and arrangements in mind. Once the prayers get resumed Bagesh Ling, the present priest of Kedarnath temple and other staff will remain there till the doors get closed on November 5,” he said.

Bagesh Ling, who was inside the temple on the fateful day, is in Ukhimath now and waiting for prayer to get resumed.

“We are collecting all the necessary stuff for purification and traditional puja,” Bagesh said.

“Prayers will be offered to Kaal Bhairav first. Then we will offer Balbhog to Kedarnath, after that there will be Abhishek and Shringar of God and we will offer Mahabhog. There will be a Sampoorna arti in the evening. This is the tradition and will be followed till the doors are closed for winter,” he said.

He also said that all the idols brought to Ukhimath after the floods will be taken back to Kedarnath.

“We had brought the movable idols of Ganesh, Parvati, Shankar, Kaal Bhairav and Shaligram to Ukhimath but now we will take them back to Kedarnath. After offering bhog to them, the prayers can resume,” he said.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
525,525,mumbai,2013,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/NT9TTZM8GerAVk3Exl00rK/A-survivors-tale-from-the-Uttarakhand-floods.html,24 Jun 2013,A survivors’ tale from the Uttarakhand floods,"Gauchar Rescue Base: Smita Sharma and Suman Sharma hobbled back from the helicopter in a daze, their bare feet swollen and bruised, hair flying under the wind kicked up by the rotors.

The two sisters from Gohana in Haryana have been rescued from a place they thought they would not return alive.

Trapped in Rambara, a traveler’s rest stop 7km from the Himalayan shrine of Kedarnath, the sisters spent eight days in the open with their parents before being evacuated by an air force chopper on Sunday afternoon.

“There were thousands of people in Rambara when the river started swelling,"" said Smita, 22. “Everyone started scrambling up the mountain into the forest.""

It rained ceaselessly for three days, and the people, soaking wet and covered in mud, spent the nights hugging trees and rocks.

“We were shivering and numb, the ground beneath us was trembling all the time, and the first night we were in the forest, a landslide came down six or seven feet from us, and it took hundreds of people,"" Smita says.

An old man holding on to a tree next to her panicked when he saw the landslide, and slid to his death.

“I was holding on to his hand, we were all shrieking, we couldn’t understand what was happening, and suddenly I saw he wasn’t there anymore,"" Smita said. “I could not breathe. I was sure I would fall, too. So many old people died, so many little children. Every day I saw five or six people slip and go down the mountain and die.""

The Sharmas, like thousands of others, kept moving through the jungle every chance they got, to try and get as far away from Kedarnath as they could.

“We had no food for four days, and then we reached the ruins of a horse shed where we found some sacks of horse feed, so we ate that,"" Smita says. That day, they reached Junglechatti, a traveler’s stop on the Kedarnath route that was washed away as well.

The rescue forces, too, had reached the area by 21 June, aided by paratroopers who had opened a route after being air-dropped to a place a couple of kilometers from Junglechatti. The army and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had then cleared a landing spot for air force helicopters for evacuation.

The sisters, sitting in the relief camp next to the temporary air base set up at Gauchar village, 32km from Rudraprayag, are still waiting for their parents to be evacuated.

Rescue operations on one of the two fronts were successfully concluded on Sunday. Pilgrims and residents stranded across the Alaknanda river valley at Govindghat, on the trekking route to Hemkund, were successfully evacuated by 6.30pm. Both air evacuation and a land route were used. As many as 550 people were lifted out of there on Sunday, and 1,332 crossed over on foot, according to the army.

Parman Bhandari, an Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) mountaineer, was lowered above the raging river on a rope and a harness so that he could construct a temporary bridge using washed up water pipelines, aluminium ladders and ropes.

His colleagues managed to make a rope and pulley system across the river as well, so children and the elderly could be put in harnesses attached to the pulley and slide through to the other side.

“And this despite the fact that we lost a lot of time in the morning due to rain and bad weather conditions,"" said Brigadier Akshat Arora, who is heading the operations from Joshimath.

More choppers flew in and out of the rescue bases set up in Fata, Gauchar, Joshimath, Guptkashi and Dharasu on Sunday than on any other day since the flash floods wiped out villages, pilgrim towns and roads on 16 and 17 June. At Joshimath, three Mi-17, three Cheetah and three civilian helicopters were in action on Sunday, compared with one Mi-17 and two civilian helicopters the day before.

“We were running out of time since Day 1,"" said Air Vice-Marshall S.R.K Nair, who flew in to Gauchar on Sunday. “Today was the biggest day for us since operations started.""

Armed forces vehicles, and buses, cars and jeeps from various state governments and non-governmental organizations plied up and down the mountain roads, carrying relief material and fuel, and bringing down the rescued. Relief camps were dotted around the rescue bases.

Eight hundred people were evacuated from the route to Kedarnath, with eight helicopters flying out of Gauchar alone. A couple of hundred still remain stranded.

Wing Commander Nikhil Naidu spotted a lone couple on top of a hill on Sunday near Junglechatti, and winched down an NDRF commando with harnesses so that they could be rescued.

“A total of 3,200 people were evacuated by IAF (Indian Air Force) choppers today (Sunday),"" said Air Commodore Rajesh Issar, who is leading the IAF’s operations from Dehradun.

As many as 5,000 people are still awaiting rescue at Badrinath at the end of the day’s operations, according to the army. Mountaineers from ITBP and the army also opened a walking route from Badrinath, down to Govindghat on Sunday in incredibly difficult conditions, through landslides, rockfalls and gushing rain-fed streams.

Close to 2,000 people are also stranded in Harsil valley on the Gangotri pilgrim route.

The meteorological department has forecast heavy rain for the next 72 hours. “We hope they have got it wrong,"" said Issar. “Our focus now is evacuation at Harsil and Badrinath, and search and rescue in the Kedarnath route, where we hope very few are left.""

The horsemen refused to take them downhill. So did the porters. They had seen rains in the hills, but this downpour was something else. With no other choice, 16-year-old Libni Garg and family decided to trek down to base camp Gauri Kund from Kedarnath in the state of Uttarakhand. A peaceful pilgrimage suddenly took a different turn on the morning of June 16, 2013. “It was freezing…it rained so much that raincoats were pointless,” says Libni, speaking over phone from Dehradun. “We finally managed to hire two porters.” Libni’s story of struggle and survival will be featured in Himalayan Tsunami , a documentary that will be aired on the Discovery Channel.

Boulders cracked and trundled past them; bridges collapsed and rains beat against them with a vengeance. Libni and family moved on, desperate to reach safe ground. Once at Rambada, located 7 km from the base, they decided to rest for the night. Little did they know of the danger that awaited them the next morning.

Rains poured all night while they slept fitfully. Libni’s family was stranded. “The owner of the lodge in which we stayed was over 70 years old. He told us that not once in his lifetime had he seen floods rise over the first step of the building. But that day, water had reached the fifth step,” she recalls. The locals had never experienced such rains — there was chaos everywhere. “We were compelled to walk against the stream back to Kedarnath,” says Libni.

It was during this trek that Libni was witness to something she would never forget. A wall of water thundered past them, dragging along houses, utensils, cattle… As thousands lost their lives and everything they held close to the floods, Libni and her family walked on, forcing themselves not to look back. For it was the best they could do for their survival. “I asked my dad where we were going. And he said ‘I don’t know’,” says Libni. “That was when I got really scared.”

They reached level ground at last and rested their tired feet when suddenly — “A local shouted ‘Run, water!’” They did so without second thought. What followed were long hours of starvation; sleepless nights; and journeys that seemed to have no end or purpose. “Even the food packets the Government dropped from helicopters did not reach us,” says Libni. For, they were stranded in the remotest of corners. Help arrived at last on the morning of June 20 — they were airlifted by the Army along with other survivors. For Libni, who studies in a boarding school in Dehradun, the experience taught her the value of life. “I won’t take anything for granted,” she says. “Problems that seemed big before appear trivial now.” Will she be going to Uttarakhand again? “No,” she says. “I don’t think I’m going back.” Himalayan Tsunami, to be aired at 9 p.m. on December 23, looks at “what really happened” during the Uttarakhand disaster and “why”.",flood,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 20, 2013","['Kedarnath', 'Rudraprayag', 'Chamoli', 'Pithoragarh', 'Uttarkashi']","['Kedarnath: 300 mm', 'Rudraprayag: 250 mm', 'Chamoli: 200 mm', 'Pithoragarh: 150 mm', 'Uttarkashi: 100 mm']","['1,000+ people killed', '100,000+ people displaced', 'Rudraprayag bridge destroyed', 'Kedarnath temple damaged', 'Infrastructure damaged']",,"['Loss of lives', 'Loss of property', 'Disruption of livelihoods', 'Environmental damage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

NAGPUR: Over 100 survivors of the Kedarnath floods returned home to Nagpur and nearby towns on Sunday. There were emotional scenes on the platform as relatives hugged each other tearfully and distributed sweets to passers-by.""We have faced death and reached Nagpur. It was a harrowing experience,"" said Kishor Singh Bais, who was in tears as he hugged his mother and children.""We saw apocalypse with our eyes,"" said his wife Kiran, who was consoling her three children.Ravi Bokade was waiting for his 58-year-old mother Tulsabai and others. ""There was no contact for three to four days, and we were scared to death,"" said Manoj Miske, whose parents had organized the tour for the group to Kedarnath.Recalling their traumatic experiences, many survivors said the scenes give them nightmares. Himanshu Nimje told TOI, ""We saw bodies floating in the river , hanging on trees on the mountains. It was a macabre scene. Later, we even saw some uniformed men throwing bodies into the river.""Almost all the people who came back lamented about the apathy of the Uttarakhand government during the tragedy. We have been saved due to our own efforts, said most survivors. ""There was no relief from the government and people there were looting us. We had to buy one paratha for Rs 80 and a water bottle for Rs 100,"" said Manisha Gupta, who returned by Andhra Pradesh Express with a group of about 40, which also included children.Another traveller in the group, Anil Singh Tomar, however had a different tale to tell. ""In contrast to other stories of inhuman behaviour, I found people who were really helpful. Our experience was traumatizing but wherever we went people helped us.""Yuvraj Yadav of Sitabuldi, who had gone with three friends , slammed the Indian Army and ITBP for their shoddy rescue work. ""All the images on TV present a false picture. The army dropped 15 bags of food for about 500 people, that too only once in four days that I was in Gaurikund area. We spent two days practically without food at an army base,"" he told TOI.Laxminarayan Kawale had taken a group of 30 pilgrims from Kamptee, Hingna and other towns. He was dead tired when he reached the city on Sunday evening on the Dakshin Express. He is disgusted with the rapacious behaviour of locals. ""The driver we persuaded to bring us back to Rishikesh from Gaurikund was demanding Rs 50,000. Thankfully, some charitable organizations intervened,"" he said.There is a ray of hope for Nagpurians whose relatives are missing from Gaurikund. A government officer told TOI that some people rescued from Gaurikund on Sunday told Uttarakhand authorities that some people from Nagpur were waiting to be evacuated from a village. However, they could not provide their names. Eight Nagpurians who had gone missing near Badrinath were rescued on Sunday. One of them is Subhash Patne.A fifteen-year-old pilgrim from Risod (district Washim) died for want of food and water in Rambada (near Kedarnath). Pradyumna Toshniwal had gone with his parents on Chardham Yatra. Realizing that the boy's condition was worsening, his father Purushottam offered Rs 1 lakh to a local to arrange for food and water. However, the local vanished with the money.Seeing their son dying of hunger in front of their eyes was too much for Purushottam and his wife Surekha. They stopped eating and fainted on the fifth day. Fortunately, an army helicopter reached Rambada that day and airlifted them to Gauchar, where they were force fed at the hospital.Around 50 pilgrims from Nagpur and nearby towns were still untraceable till Sunday evening. All of them were in Kedarnath-Gaurikund area when the floods struck. The Nagpur divisional commissionerate has appealed to the relatives of missing persons from Wardha, Bhandara, Gondia, Nagpur, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts to send pictures, cell numbers, e-mail and related information to revenue department officials so that the district administration will be able to launch a search for them.While relatives of pilgrims stranded in Uttarakhand were running from to pillar to post, those in charge of assisting them were at their apathetic worst. Aprup Adawadkar, district disaster management officer, did not attend office on Saturday and Sunday, and kept his mobile switched off.A government officer who got information about some pilgrims from Nagpur rescued from Kedarnath wanted to pass on the information to resident deputy collector Pramod Bhusari. However, Bhusari's mobile was switched off. He is supposed to keep up to date information about the stranded pilgrims.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
529,529,mumbai,2013,https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/06/19/what-climate-change-means-africa-asia-coastal-poor,19 Jun 2013,"What Climate Change Means for Africa, Asia and the Coastal Poor","As the coastal cities of Africa and Asia expand, many of their poorest residents are being pushed to the edges of livable land and into the most dangerous zones for climate change. Their informal settlements cling to riverbanks and cluster in low-lying areas with poor drainage, few public services, and no protection from storm surges, sea-level rise, and flooding.

These communities – the poor in coastal cities and on low-lying islands – are among the world’s most vulnerable to climate change and the least able to marshal the resources to adapt, a new report finds. They face a world where climate change will increasingly threaten the food supplies of Sub-Saharan Africa and the farm fields and water resources of South Asia and South East Asia within the next three decades, while extreme weather puts their homes and lives at risk.

A new scientific report commissioned by the World Bank and released on June 19 explores the risks to lives and livelihoods in these three highly vulnerable regions. Turn Down the Heat: Climate Extremes, Regional Impacts, and the Case for Resilience (Read it in Issuu, Scribd, Open Knowledge Repository) takes the climate discussion to the next level, building on a 2012 World Bank report that concluded from a global perspective that without a clear mitigation strategy and effort, the world is headed for average temperatures 4 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times by the end of this century.

Small number, big problem

Communities around the world are already feeling the impacts of climate change today, with the planet only 0.8 ºC warmer than in pre-industrial times. Many of us could experience the harsher impacts of a 2ºC warmer world within our lifetimes – 20 to 30 years from now – and 4ºC is likely by the end of the century without global action.

The report lays out what these temperature increases will look like, degree-by-degree, in each targeted region and the damage anticipated for agricultural production, coastal cities, and water resources.

“The scientists tell us that if the world warms by 2°C – warming which may be reached in 20 to 30 years – that will cause widespread food shortages, unprecedented heat-waves, and more intense cyclones,"" said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim. ""In the near-term, climate change, which is already unfolding, could batter the slums even more and greatly harm the lives and the hopes of individuals and families who have had little hand in raising the Earth's temperature.”

The report, based on scientific analysis by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Climate Analytics, uses advanced computer simulations to paint the clearest picture of each region’s vulnerabilities. It describes the risks to agriculture and livelihood security in Sub-Saharan Africa; the rise in sea-level, loss of coral reefs and devastation to coastal areas likely in South East Asia; and the fluctuating water resources in South Asia that can lead to flooding in some areas and water scarcity in others, as well as affecting power supply.

“The second phase of this report truly reiterates our need to bring global attention to the tasks necessary to hold warming to 2ºC,” said Rachel Kyte, the Bank’s vice president for sustainable development. “Our ideas at the World Bank have already been put into practice as we move forward to assist those whose lives are particularly affected by extreme weather events.”",issue,2011 Thailand floods,Thailand,July 2011,January 2012,"Bangkok, Ayutthaya, Pathum Thani, Nakhon Pathom, Samut Prakan, Samut Sakhon, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, Nakhon Nayok, Lopburi, Saraburi, Sing Buri, Suphan Buri, Kanchanaburi, Ratchaburi, Phetchaburi, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Chumphon, Surat Thani, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Phatthalung, Songkhla, Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat","1,000 mm",US$45 billion,811,"13 million people affected, 1 million people displaced, 40,000 houses destroyed, 100,000 houses damaged",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

with a stream running through the middle of the house, the nature retreat by mumbai-based studio architecture brio is delicately woven into the landscape. located in alibag, india the spaces alternatively open and close to the different characteristics of the site. placed on the banks of the water, the building forms a sudden s-curve, enabling a short walk along the edge of the stream before entering. fostering a sense of anticipation, the limbs of the structure reach out into the landscape to make full use of its resources and surroundings. the volume itself is deformed, stretched and pushed in to dramatize specific moments – such as a tree or view of the mountain in the distance. the external concrete shell contracts and expands in plan and also in section, its orientation moving from high to low with the fluidity of the monolithic form.



the master bedroom is connected to the main house through a steel bridge

the house consists of two parts: the main daytime living areas are separated from the master bedroom by a bridge that spans across the stream – with a series a-symmetrical axis that help to create a path of discovery. the cantilevered ‘limbs’ of the living room and two bedrooms defy the heaviness of the concrete volumes, by not resting on the ground the relationship with the landscape is paradoxically strengthened.

the strong mass is contrasted by the lightness of the white washed walls and ceilings on the interior. at the heart of the house is the kitchen; a large, open-plan space that connects directly to the outside with a feature skylight that helps flood the volume with natural light. offering a panoramic view of the mountain range, the living room is lifted off the ground, while the layout’s main orientation is based on climatic considerations.

cast in plank-finished concrete with a vertical grain, the exposed material in the humid indian climate attracts a patina, becoming visually richer over time. its grey, textured surface provides a neutral backdrop against the vibrant green surroundings. elegant timber screens further soften the exterior, not only forming a buffer between the outside and inside, but also creating an intensive play of shadow and light on the floors and walls.

Two deaths each were reported from Bhadrak, Jajpur and Nayagarh districts while in worst-hit Ganjam district it remained unchanged at six and four in Jagatsinghpur, Special Relief Commissioner P K Mohapatra told reporters here after the situation was reviewed by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik.

""All the deaths were due to wall collapse and drowning,"" Mohapatra said.

Major rivers like Rusikulya, Godahada and Vansadhara were flowing below the danger mark, he said.

The Chief Minister said that the incessant rains and floods have caused severe damage to public and private property and standing crop.

He announced three-day relief for the affected people as per provisions under the Relief Code.

It would be distributed in Ganjam, Gajapati, Kandhamal, Puri, Khurda, Nayagarh, Jajpur, Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack, Balasore, Bhadrak and Mayurbhanj districts, SRC office sources said.

Two of the three helicopters used for rescue operations in Ganjam district would return to base shortly with the remaining one to be retained for relief operations, the relief commissioner said.

Relief teams could now approach inundated areas in boats, he added.

Over 5.32 lakh people in 2,276 villages were affected by the floods, while about 1.47 lakh people were evacuated.

Of the 129 villages inundated in Ganjam district by flash flood yesterday, water receded in its 69 villages.

An IMD bulletin said that heavy to very heavy rainfall would occur over the next 48 hours at one or two places over Koraput, Malkangiri, Nawarangpur, Rayagada, Gajapati and Kalahandi districts and heavy rainfall at one or two places over north Odisha.

According to latest news, It is stated that the concert will be performed on Monday.

""Jinxed."" That was overwhelming opinion of fans of Swedish electronic dance super-group Swedish House Mafia after their concert had to be cancelled for the second time in India in less than three months.

The concert, scheduled in Bangalore for Sunday was put off as the plane carrying the group from Jakarta to India was damaged following a storm and floods there, and the members were unable to leave, a note on the SHM Facebook page said.

The SHM concert in Mumbai on November 17 was postponed on account of Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray's death.

Organisers of the event, Sunburn Arena, said they were working to reschedule the Bangalore show, part of the band's farewell tour, for Monday, January 21. This has not yet been confirmed.

Ticket-holders were promised a refund if the concert was cancelled.

But this came as small consolation to fans, who took to social media sites to express their disappointment even as rumours about the postponement were put to rest with the group's announcement.

""We've been looking forward to the show since September, when it was initially announced,"" said Ashmita Mangharam, a class 12 student in Bangalore. She says she lost about Rs. 9,000 making the trip for the cancelled concert in Mumbai last year, with 15 other friends.

Dhiren Raghu, an engineering student at R.V. College too says he spent Rs. 15,000 on his savings to make the trip to Mumbai last year, and was excited that the group whom he had followed for years was finally coming to Bangalore. ""I hope the concert happens on Monday,"" he said.

Questions to the organisers on the number of tickets sold and the security measures in place to control crowds, were not answered at the time of writing. At least 25,000 people were expected to attend the concert in Mumbai and a similar number in Bangalore.

The rescheduled show in Mumbai will go on as announced on Tuesday, organisers added.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Prabhat Jauhari is the chief executive officer of Tops Air Rescue and Topsline Life Response Services, the first private emergency response service in Mumbai, which was started by Topsgrup in 2004. The Topsline crew, which is trained in rescue and evacuation operations, worked with the Mumbai police during the terror attacks of Nov. 26, 2008, to rescue over 150 people.

India Ink spoke with Dr. Jauhari, who is also an anesthesiologist, about Topsline’s involvement in the rescue efforts in 2008, the need for better emergency response services in the city and the change in attitudes toward security in the five years since the attacks.

Q.

Topsgrup has been one of the first Indian companies involved in corporatizing private security, while in most other countries emergency response is a government responsibility. Why was it important that this is a service that should be provided by a private company?

A.

Topsline was conceived by Mr. Diwan Rahul Nanda in 2004 when he felt that there was a complete lack of professional help to citizens in Mumbai. Topsline is an emergency response service, perhaps the only private player in the world, based on the 911 services in the United States. We reach people in nine minutes wherever they are in Mumbai for any kind of emergency, which could be assault, molestation, car accidents, short circuit, burglary, fire and medical emergencies. We charge a monthly fee of approximately $3 for this service. Today, Topsline has about 300,000 members in Mumbai and are planning to start in perhaps Bangalore or Delhi. There is definitely a lack in the government provided emergency services, which is why people would sign up for this.

Q.

How was Topsline involved in the rescue efforts during the Nov. 26, 2008, terror attacks in Mumbai?

A.

In case there is a terrorist attack or a crisis like the floods in Mumbai, Topsline has 30 vehicles, which are equipped to fight fire and deal with medical emergencies, and 70 bikes, which carry paramedics and commandos. When the attack started on 26th November in the night, and the first shots were fired at the Leopold Cafe, our vehicle was parked nearby, so we rushed to the spot. That night at Leopold Cafe, we transported eight people to Cama Hospital.

Then Hasan Gafoor, the commissioner of police in Mumbai during the attacks, said that they needed more people on the scene. Subsequently, our crew members went to the Taj, Trident and Nariman House along with the police commandos and helped to retrieve the wounded. The National Security Guard commandos took some time to reach the scene so our people were helping rescue 24 people trapped in the rooms inside the Taj. Throughout the next three days, Topsline crewmembers were right at the front of the action and saved over 150 lives.

Q.

Have attitudes toward emergency response services and security changed in Mumbai after the attacks?

A.

I think there has been a shift in attitudes because I believe that general awareness has increased and so has the perceived need to make oneself secure. Today, women are carrying pepper sprays; people are securing their houses through video camera and putting in place alarm systems. From our point of view, there was a surge in membership for emergency response services in the months following 26/11. India is a country where people don’t believe they need life insurance; they don’t take Mediclaim. There is a very casual attitude towards life — people don’t want to spend money on precautionary measures. That is slowly changing.

Before this, there was a lack of preparedness if any emergency strikes or there is any natural disaster. After this attack, awareness increased and all the major corporate houses have started taking initiatives and are conducting safety drills periodically. On a global scale, after attacks like 9/11 and 26/11, terrorism has been highlighted, and more countries are aware of the need to take measures to handle it by cooperating with each other.

Q.

What were some of the lessons learned during the 2008 attacks?

A.

Preparedness and awareness are the best tools we have. Security has to become a prime concern. Five years after the attacks, five-star hotels have secured themselves but what about a mall? Anyone can enter a crowded shopping mall with a weapon. What has been done about the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station, where the maximum people were killed? Also, the police officers on the scene were lacking certain emergency equipment, such as torches and ropes, needed to help rescue people from the site. Our team was able to provide these things while jointly working with the commandos.

Q.

How was the security threat posed by the terrorists in the 2008 attacks unlike those faced by the city before?

A.

It was a very refined operation, and a very elongated operation. They came armed to the teeth with sophisticated weapons, and they also came prepared to die. To fight someone who has come prepared to die is a very tough task. They targeted areas where they could cause the maximum casualties, and where there were foreigners so that they would get media attention. It was not just vengeance — it was planned to the last detail.

Q.

What are some of the new key developments in the security industry?

A.

There has been a rising demand for electronic surveillance systems, manned guarding and intelligence inputs such as background checks on people joining organizations. People today are demanding better quality of services both in prevention and in response, if and when something happens. There is a need for more professional companies in the sector.

Prayers resumed at the Kedarnath shrine on Wednesday morning after the Gandhi sarovar overflowed and flooded Kedarnath on June 17.

The prayers, which were resumed within 3 months of the catastrophe, started at 7 a.m. on Wednesday. Vageeshling, who is a representative of the Rawal (chief priest) said, “Rawal Bhimashankar Ling started the purification of the temple along with other priests, people from the State administration, and the members of the Badrinath-Kedarnath Temple Commiittee.”

Prayers started after the purification was over, Vageeshling said.

Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna was unable to attend the prayers as inclement weather prevented him from travelling.

A rock, believed to have saved the temple from the floods by preventing the flood waters from destroying the temple, was also worshipped. Some priests have named the rock Divya Shila (divine rock) while others call it the Bheem Shila.

The prayers continued till evening. Rameshwar Jamloki, a priest in the temple said, “From Thursday, the prayers will start in the morning and will continue till the evening. This routine will be followed till the beginning of the Diwali festival after which the prayers in the temple will be over for the year and will resume only next year.”

The prayers started on May 14 this year but stopped on June 17. Between June 17 and September 11, Vageeshling continued the prayers of the Bhog murti, which is a symbol of lord Shiva. The Bhog murti was shifted to Garudchatti on June 18. From there, it was moved to Okhimath on June 20 and it continued to be worshipped there before it was brought to Kedarnath temple for the prayers.

On Wednesday, around 300 people attended the prayers. Dilip Jawalkar, District Magistrate, Rudraprayag, said, “In the last one month around 800 people have been deployed here, including the people from the Public Works Department, hydel power, and water department.”

The police, the National Disaster Response Force personnel, and members of the National Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) were also stationed here.

The June 17 deluge had destroyed the buildings around the Kedarnath temple. The landscape is covered with the after effects of the deluge. Though the prayers have resumed, it would take many years for Kedarnath to be rebuilt.

A three-member team from the Geological Survey of India (GSI) has been mapping the Kedarnath area from September 9. The GSI would give a report to the government based on which the rebuilding of the area would take place.

The NIM has currently placed tents 2 km away from the temple. Some pre-fabricated huts have also been placed here. Water facility and electricity have been resumed in the area.

Mr. Jawalkar said locals, who live nearby, can visit the temple after taking the authorities’ permission. Pilgrims, however, would not be allowed to visit the temple till September 30.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

While one of them, 21-year-old Murti, died from drowning, the other five managed to escape a series of calamities as they found themselves stranded in the thick jungle, engulfed by floodwaters and chased down by a herd of elephants - all in the middle of the night.According to police, Venkatesh, Kantaraju, Anil, Hombaiah, Girish and Murti, all residents of Bangalore, drove to Muttati on Tuesday in an Indica car. After spending the day, at around 10.30pm, they decided to head back to Bangalore and took the Muttati-Satanur road.While driving in the forest area, they lost their way and inadvertently took a wrong turn to a mud road which eventually led them to a stream. The stream was in full spate due to heavy rain in the region. They didn't realize the depth of water and drove the car straight into the flood waters. The water current carried the vehicle along with its occupants. While five of them managed to extricate themselves out of the car, Murti couldn't and he was swept away along with the car.The other swam to safety and frantically began to search for their missing friend. While they were scouring the area, they found themselves amid a herd of elephants. As the elephants came for them, the youth quickly climbed some trees and stayed up till dawn.On Wednesday morning, they clambered down and continued their search for Murti.
