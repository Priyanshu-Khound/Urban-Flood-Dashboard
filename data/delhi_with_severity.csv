The water level in Yamuna rose up from 203.14 metre on Sunday to 205.4 metres on Monday going past the danger mark of 205.33 metres. Reportedly, water level rose to 208.48 metres on Thursday morning and Central Water Commission has termed it as an ‚Äòextreme situation‚Äô.

Delhi Lt Governor VK Saxena has called a meeting of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday to discuss the flood situation in the city while CM Kejriwal has urged Union Home Minister Amit Shah that water from Hathnikund barrage in Haryana be released in a slow and pointed out manner to prevent flooding in the national capital.

Furthermore, Kejriwal on Thursday informed that rising Yamuna levels have led to the water treatment plants at Wazirabad, Chandrwal and Okhla to be shut and it could lead to a water supply issue in some areas.

Why is Delhi facing flood-like situation?

The highly unusual flood-like situation in Delhi can be attributed to two major factors i.e. increased rainfall in the national captial and surrounding areas and increased discharge of water from Haryana's Hathnikund barrage.

According to CWC, the flow rate from the Hathnikund barrage remained 1.5 cusecs above the normal level at night. The normal flow rate from the barrage is 352 cusecs but heavy rainfall led to increased discharge. One cusec is equivalent to 28.32 litres per second.

Meanwhile, Delhi saw the highest rainfall in a single day in the month of July since 1982. The national capital received 153mm rainfall in the 24 hours ending 8:30 am on Sunday which was followed by 107mm rainfall in the next 24 hours.

Principal director of the Natural Heritage Division at the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage Manu Bhatnagar blamed heavy rainfall in a short period of time as the primary reason for the rising water level in Yamuna.

""The same amount of water falling over a longer period of time would not lead to such a situation as it allows time for the water to pass through. Even a lesser amount of precipitation can result in a higher level downstream if it falls in a shorter period of time,"" Bhatnagar told news agency PTI.

Bhim Singh Rawat, associate coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers, People (SANDRP) blamed the rising Yamuna water level due to significant silt accumulation.

""More than 20 bridges within the 22-kilometre river stretch from Wazirabad to Okhla obstruct the flow, leading to the deposition of silt in the riverbed and the formation of numerous mid-stream sandbars,"" Rawat noted.

delhi,2023,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/blunt-frank/delhi-floods-a-floundering-administration/,16-Jul-23,Delhi floods & a floundering administration,"Large parts of Delhi have been flooded in last few days with water from River Yamuna overflowing its embankments. The incessant rains in Delhi and surrounding states too have added to the misery. Was Delhi prepared for such an eventuality? Obviously, it was not. No one had any control on the freaky weather conditions that led to this deluge and release of excess water from dams and reservoirs into the Yamuna River from neighbouring states. But what was glaringly missing is the flood control measures and planning. Both, the state and central governments, are equally indictable for the failure. If contingency planning and resources were in place, the misery and havoc caused would have been much less.

A lot of muck is already flowing in the air as part of political rhetoric and the blame game will go on. Aspersions, acquisitions, and charges are being levied by the state government on Centre and vice versa. There are even charges, by some leaders of the AAP, of a conspiracy hatched by the BJP against the Delhi government to flood the state. One such leader went on to term the BJP as enemy of his party on national television and accused it of seeking revenge on AAP for the loss of state of elections. Unfortunately, such slander, meaningless and baseless as it is, will not mitigate the pain and sufferings of the common man. But then for most politicians, the common man is just a pawn to be used and abused at will to further their own political objectives.

The question here is ‚Äì do the authorities and experts in the field even know what to do to avert such fiascos? Whatever planning that they do is reactionary to contain the problem after it occurs. There is a total absence of any long-term planning to prevent such devastations from occurring. Lip service on the issue of cleaning and managing the flow of River Yamuna has been doing the rounds for decades but the net result on the ground is negligible. Billions of rupees have been spent on this with no visible benefits whatsoever. Every government talks of a long-term plan but that plan is still nowhere in sight. This is no different than the air pollution issue that comes up each year from October to December in Delhi.

Shoring up of embankments, plugging fissures that develop along the banks, pumping out water from flooded areas, moving people living on or around the river bed, rescuing stranded people, arranging material relief, medical aid etc. are part of the temporary measures that administrations bring into action when disasters stare them in. the eye. While they do provide immediate assistance to some of the affected citizens, they do not help in prevention of similar catastrophes in future. The politicians beat their chests to announce the splendid work done by them and use such difficult times for ‚Äòphoto ops.‚Äô The departments concerned and their experts heave a sigh of relief and know it is time to relax for next ten months. Their insincerity and lack of concern is evident in every move that they make. The poor citizen is thankful for the minor mercies and stands in queue to vote for the same politicians once again a few years later. Next monsoon season, the story repeats itself once again.

There are a few fundamental issues that need to be addressed if Delhi has to be spared from routine flooding. Surprisingly there is hardly any discussion on these. One even wonders if the same have even been identified by experts and authorities concerned. These are:

The official danger mark for Yamuna River in Delhi is 205.33 M. There are markers sunk in to measure this depth. The point is does the river really enjoy this depth for flow of water in reality? What about the depth reduced due to sedimentation that takes place every year? Even a couple of meters of deposits over the years will reduce the safe water carrying capacity of the river by a huge margin. The river touched the 208.66 M mark in the recent floods. Is it possible that the actual depth available was less by a few meters which led to flooding? It is well known that the need for de-sedimentation receives a lot of lip service but never transcends into action on the ground.

Next, is the strengthening of the river‚Äôs embankments on a regular basis and erecting suitable barriers at vulnerable points across the length of the river as it flows across Delhi. There is hardly any evidence of this happening on the ground.

Related to above is the constant illegal encroachment of the river bed and the unbridled construction that takes place on such land. Apart from restricting the width of the river bed, such areas pose constant danger to people who inhabit them. The Delhi government, traditionally, overlooks encroachment.

Creating buffer zones along the river banks should be integral to any planning in such matters. Unfortunately, Delhi has no such provisions since we have markets, public places and housing complexes that literally abut the banks in many places. The areas from Majnu Ka Tilla to ISBT and Okhla are prime examples in this regard.

Ideally, the state of Delhi must have a few additional channels that can help in offloading of the water from the main river as per situation in hand. Unfortunately, no such new channels have been created, perhaps not even thought of. Today, with availability of satellite pictures, designing and creating such channels with flow control measures is a much simpler task. Selectively, even small artificial lakes/reservoirs could be added, as part of overall flood water management in the capital.

Coordination between Delhi and other adjoining states for controlling flow of water in the river is pathetic to say the least. It is no use if the Chief Minister of Delhi approaches Haryana or Punjab governments once the water is already released or about to be released. Such critical issues cannot be dealt with on personal equations or on a day-to-day basis. There must be well considered detailed instructions and SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) on what needs to be done in such situations without any special consideration of any particular state.

States must be self-sufficient in managing their disasters in terms of experts, manpower and other material resources. It is obvious Delhi has hardly any such resource in place. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) can only augment the state efforts. Any expectations that once called, it will manage on its own in totality can only be seen as the state shirking its responsibility. Given their national level commitments, this force cannot be at the beck and call of all states at all times.

There was a lot of talk of a national water grid and interlinking of main rivers across the country many years back. The subject seems to have been put on a back burner for some unknown reasons. It is time to revive it and give it some serious thought as national water management will benefit the nation in many ways including flood control.

The callousness and lack of effective management can be gauged from the claims of Delhi‚Äôs minister in charge of the departments of Irrigation & Flood Control and Delhi Jal Board. He flashed what‚Äôs up message on national television, sent to different authorities, to requisition NDRF teams and Army Engineers to manage and repair a key building regulator which had been breached. Perhaps he thought he was requesting a local plumber in his colony to come and look at the problem in hand. One wonders if he forgot about the resources and expertise available within his own departments.

The Delhi state‚Äôs elected government must understand that as far as Delhi citizens are concerned, the buck stops at their door step. It is for them to find ways and means to interact and function in tandem with the central and other state governments. This constant bickering and blaming everyone for their failures will not take them or the state anywhere. It goes without saying that any long-term sound plan to avert such disasters will need the cooperation and involvement of other state and central governments as well. The onus of achieving that and ensuring Delhi‚Äôs safety will always lie with the local government.

delhi,2023,https://thewire.in/environment/development-rogue-flood-delhi,20-Jul-23,Development Gone 'Rogue' and the High Flood in Delhi,"Over the past few weeks, many parts of North India have faced severe flooding, landslides and deaths. The unprecedented floods in Delhi have brought this crisis to national and international attention. The water level in the river Yamuna reached a record high of 208.66 metres, much above the last great flood in Delhi in 1978 ‚Äì when it had reached 207.49 metres. Yamuna, before it changed its course, used to flow by the ramparts of the Red Fort and once again has arrived there. It has led to the flooding of several projects of ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô ‚Äì water treatment plants, the arterial ring road, rich and poor residential areas, drainage, etc.

Delhi got flooded after the heavy rains stopped in the NCR because of the release of flood waters from the Hathnikund barrage in Haryana, 250 km from Delhi. The waters took three days to reach Delhi. The barrage regulates the flow from the catchment areas in the mountains that have witnessed intense rains and destruction due to landslides. The Delhi government has blamed the Haryana government for the Delhi floods. But two facts make clear that the blame cannot be easily apportioned.

First, the peak water release from Hathnikund, of about 3.5 lakh cusecs, is half of what was sometimes released in the past but did not result in extreme flooding like at present. Second, extreme flooding has not occurred anywhere between the barrage and Delhi. In other words, the record flood in Delhi is not due to unusually high discharge from Hathnikund.

Flow through Delhi impeded

If the problem is not the water coming to Delhi, then it must be the state of Yamuna during its course through Delhi. The water flow must be slowing down and the level of the river bed has risen due to the high rate of sedimentation. These factors would cause water to rise vertically and enter the city. So, what are the ongoing processes affecting the river flow?

Faster the flow of water in the river, less would be the flooding. The flow is being impeded by excessive and unplanned construction in and around the river. The pillars of the many bridges impede water flow. Bunds have been constructed to channel the flow of the river. Large-scale encroachments on the floodplains have come up, like for the Commonwealth Games and the construction of the Akshardham temple. Colonies have sprung up on the floodplains and they were the first to be flooded. Fortunately, the programme to beautify the riverfront has not yet taken off but if it does materialise, it will further aggravate any future crisis.

Discharging polluted water into the river through the various drains/rivers passing through Delhi and its neighbourhood has caused havoc. It not only pollutes the water, causing environmental damage, but also leads to siltation and rise in the level of the river bed. Water hyacinth grows in the polluted water and that further impedes the water flow.

During the dry season, most of the river water is drawn for irrigation, industrial use, etc. Every drop of water flowing through the river is sought to be utilised. This almost completely stops the flow of the river as it crosses Delhi during the dry season, leading to sedimentation and growth of vegetation.

Impact of ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô

Yamuna and its tributaries originate in the great and unstable Himalayas. The riparian states, Uttarakhand and Himachal, have seen massive unplanned construction for tourism and defence needs. Roads, hotels and other establishments have sprung up all over. Cutting of trees, hydel power projects and mining have led to the denudation of the steep hill slopes resulting in increased frequency of landslides and land subsidence. The result is sudden floods and a greater amount of sediment in the river water. Haryana and Uttar Pradesh need massive amounts of water for promoting modern agriculture.

The NCR itself is the primary example of ‚Äòrogue‚Äô development. There is huge infrastructure development leading to severe environmental degradation. Any vacant land is sought to be taken over and ‚Äòdeveloped‚Äô ‚Äì whether it be the flood plains, forests or the ridge. Every inch is sought to be paved for roads, etc. Drains are being covered up for parking and making roads or roads are being constructed over them. With little space for water to go into the soil, even small amounts of rain lead to flooding of roads and colonies.

The well-off sections consume and generate huge amounts of trash which not only goes to overflowing landfills but also into the drains and rivers. Renovation of homes and offices has become a status symbol. The resulting waste, called malba, is indiscriminately disposed of, causing further environmental problems, including for the overstretched rivers.

Development is equated with growing production and higher GDP growth. This is sought to be achieved via hugely expensive and environmentally damaging urbanisation. This starves the non-urban areas of resources, leaving them with poor infrastructure and weak job creation. The result is massive migration from rural to urban areas and a vicious cycle of increasing cost of urbanisation. Most of the migrants are forced to lead a precarious and uncivilised existence and are the worst sufferers during any calamity, like the flood or the pandemic.

This skewed pattern of development is fuelled by the growing consumerism of the well-off ‚Äì their luxury consumption, like the purchase of private automobiles. More vehicles on roads lead to air pollution, traffic jams and waste of fuel. This necessitates the building of wide roads, flyovers and metros. Broad highways and bullet trains, etc. are a corollary. Not only do all these add to the pollution, but the paving of the ground also prevents the quick percolation of water into the ground. Often, the natural flow of water is also impeded, leading to flooding.

Short-termism

The unbridled growth of consumerism is at the root of the problem of flooding. First, globally it causes climate change and extreme weather phenomena. Second, it is destabilising the Himalayas leading to more silt in the rivers that raises the river bed and reduces its carrying capacity. Third, discharging effluents in the river. Fourth, attempt to utilise the entire flow of the river water leaving little flow during the dry season. Finally, in the name of ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô, construction on any vacant land, like the flood plains.

Climate change is a global phenomenon. India alone cannot check it. Today, every country, including the richest, is facing problems. Currently, record heat is plaguing Africa, Europe, North America, China, Antarctica and the Arctic. Does this mean that India is helpless?

We can follow more rational policies. I wrote an article similar to this one after the 2005 Mumbai floods. But we are not willing to give up rogue development. Mumbai routinely gets flooded and so do other cities like Bangalore and Chennai. Consumerism and environmental degradation were Gandhi‚Äôs major concerns.

Indian policymakers have not seen Gandhi as an ideal to emulate. They cater to narrow and short-term vested interests. Misgovernance, cronyism and corruption further compound the problems. Further, any problem is quickly overtaken by other problems, of which there is no dearth, till the next big episode. Finally, in the absence of a will to adopt a holistic approach, the piecemeal solutions turn into new problems, adding to the pre-existing ones.

The current floods are not just due to local issues emanating from either Delhi or Haryana but due to the much bigger problem confronting society, namely, of development promoting consumerism and concentrated urbanisation with its rising congestion costs. Development that has gone rogue pushes India into the growth mania. It needs to be discarded to prevent future catastrophic events and reduce the nation‚Äôs vulnerability, especially that of its poor.

delhi,2023,https://india.mongabay.com/2023/07/behind-delhis-floods-is-a-history-of-encroachment-and-diminishing-wetlands/,21-Jul-23,Behind Delhi‚Äôs floods is a history of encroachment and diminishing wetlands,"Of Delhi‚Äôs 1,040 wetlands and waterbodies, none have been officially notified, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation.

The city‚Äôs drainage plan and system have not been updated since the 1970s. This along with encroachment of the Yamuna floodplains by settlements and large development projects make the city vulnerable to flooding.

Experts strongly recommend reviving the city‚Äôs water bodies and desilting its existing drains to help mitigate flood effects.

When parts of Delhi were inundated with floodwaters several meters high in early July, several reports said that the river Yamuna was reclaiming its path. The river stretches across 48 kilometers of the city, and swelled above the danger mark on July 10, leaving damages worth over Rs. 10,000 crores in its wake, according to early estimates.

Compelling as the idea of river reclamation is, experts say the floods are, however, an urgent indication to improve the city‚Äôs drainage systems. They also point to Delhi‚Äôs diminishing natural line of defence ‚Äî its water bodies and wetlands ‚Äî against such hazards, without which the river cannot drain its water naturally.

‚ÄúThe biggest wetland in Delhi is the Yamuna floodplain, which has slowly been taken over [by urban development],‚Äù said Ritesh Kumar, director for Wetlands International South-Asia (WISA). ‚ÄúTwo processes are occurring in Delhi which make it flood prone ‚Äî first, more and more surface is being concretised and covered, creating more runoff, and secondly, there are [increasing] weather impacts that the landscape is incapable of handling well.‚Äù

The Yamuna‚Äôs floodplain in Delhi is around 97 square kilometres, or 7% of the city‚Äôs area, according to the Delhi Development Authority‚Äôs 2021 Master Plan for the city. But much of this has been encroached upon by settlements and large development projects which have hindered its free flow.

The city‚Äôs 2041 Master Plan proposes to regularise some of these settlements and projects by allowing ‚Äúregulated development‚Äù along the ‚ÄòO‚Äô zone of the river, considered prone to flooding, which could worsen the city‚Äôs resilience to such disasters.

While excess water released from a nearby barrage, an aging drainage system, and heavy rainfall were some of the immediate triggers for the flooding last week, the gradual erosion of Delhi‚Äôs wetlands and the Yamuna floodplain have also contributed to the city‚Äôs vulnerability, show studies.

Role of wetlands in flood management

Wetlands can be of many different kinds, including lakes, marshes, river floodplains, and swamps, to name a few. They can also be artificial structures built for specific purposes, like reservoirs and aquaculture ponds.

‚ÄúWetlands are slow waters. Once water enters them, it starts to release sediment and it gets an accommodating space to spread. The force of the water is reduced significantly and blunts out the hydrograph,‚Äù explained Kumar.

A 2021 modeling study from a proposed constructed wetland in the north-west part of Delhi found that it could lead to an overall reduction of 23% in flooding, ‚Äúwith a significant reduction in backflow as well as water depth in the drain.‚Äù

Apart from regulating the speed and volume of water, wetlands also perform a host of other ecological functions. They host a diversity of species, recharge groundwater, and reduce downstream erosion.

Delhi has a total of 1,040 wetlands and waterbodies, according to the city‚Äôs Wetland Authority. But none of them have been officially notified yet, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. A report in The Hindu revealed that the Wetlands Authority received requests from agencies to delist over 200 wetlands, because they have dried up or been encroached upon.

‚ÄúThe National Capital Region presents a unique scenario because it has so many wetlands along with a river flowing through it,‚Äù said Madhu Verma, an environmental economist with Iora Ecological Solutions, who chairs a technical committee advising the Delhi Wetlands Authority. ‚ÄúWe are in the process of notifying some wetlands. Without notification, there can be no planning and funds cannot be allocated for their protection.‚Äù

Encroachment of wetlands

Shortly after the floodwaters breached the danger mark this month, the governments of Delhi and Haryana engaged in a dispute over water released from the old Hathnikund barrage located in Haryana, built in 1996 to divert water into the eastern and western canals of the Yamuna. The Delhi government blamed the city‚Äôs flooding on the Haryana government‚Äôs decision to release excess water directly into the river, as opposed to the canals. The Haryana government retaliated by saying it had merely followed prescribed norms when the river‚Äôs flow exceeded 1 lakh cusecs. On July 10, the peak discharge from the barrage was 3.59 lakh cusecs.

To make matters worse, floodgates in the heart of the city in ITO were reportedly jammed, exacerbating the flooding.

According to Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP), the water released from the Hathnikund barrage does not explain the extent of flooding the city saw last week, which he attributes to gradual obstructions in the river, concretisation of the floodplains, and destruction of water bodies within the city.

‚ÄúIn 2010, water released from the Hathnikund barrage exceeded 7 lakh cusecs, but water levels never breached 207.49 meters, a record level set in 1978. Three years later, over 8 lakh cusecs were discharged into the river, and still we did not see this level of flooding. Now, with only 3 lakhs of discharge, flood records have been broken. This can only mean that factors within Delhi are the reason,‚Äù he said.

Lakhs of people live on the floodplains of the Yamuna in the city, several of whom have converted the area to agricultural fields to make a livelihood. The Akshardham temple, which had a daily footfall of 6,000 before the COVID-19 pandemic, was built in 2000 on the floodplain with post-facto environmental clearance. The posh Commonwealth Games Village in 2010 too came up on the floodplains.

According to a report by the Centre for Science and Environment, the Yamuna floodplain had over 600 wetlands and waterbodies, but ‚Äúmore than 60% of them are without water, making the city prone to flooding.‚Äù The report further states that ‚Äúthe river-fed water bodies in the Yamuna floodplain are disconnected from the river because of embankments.‚Äù

Economist Verma says the destruction of floodplains and waterbodies stems from a systematic undervaluation of nature‚Äôs ecological services.

‚ÄúIt is so much more damaging and expensive when an event like this occurs, costing thousands of crores. It is much more economical to conserve these ecosystems which give us benefits in the long run,‚Äù she said.

Repairing drains and reviving waterbodies

Delhi has at least 21 drains that are connected to the Yamuna, according to A.K. Gosain, a professor with the Department of Civil Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. Gosain was part of a group that drafted a 2018 drainage plan to replace the city‚Äôs current ailing system, which hasn‚Äôt been updated since the 1970s.

What made the flooding particularly bad this time was not just heavy rainfall over the city, but a swollen river that itself blocked regular drainage pathways, Gosain explained.

The 2018 draft plan recommended desilting existing drains to improve efficiency and reviving wetlands and water bodies to improve drainage in the city.

‚ÄúWetlands and waterbodies help mitigate local flooding because they also act as storage spaces. If a waterbody can hold flood water temporarily, it prevents that much more from going into the drain,‚Äù said Gosain.

The Delhi government rejected the 2018 draft plan, calling it ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù in its approach, but has failed to finalise a drainage plan for the city to date.

Some pockets of the city are seeing a revival of waterbodies and wetlands, but not nearly at the scale required, say experts.

One such pocket is the Delhi Development Authority‚Äôs Yamuna Biodiversity Park, which is located alongside the river. Park authorities have worked to revive an active floodplain of the Yamuna river since 2009, and looked at 20-25 year old data on the river‚Äôs ‚Äúflood pulse‚Äù to chart a course of action.

The floodplain is no simple system, said senior scientist at the park, Faiyaz Khudsar, who has worked here since 2005. There are several zones within the floodplain that have to be carefully studied before restoration efforts begin, he said.

‚ÄúAfter the river channel, there is a riparian zone, then an active floodplain, then an alluvial floodplain. All these zones and their ecological integrity have to be carefully considered, because that‚Äôs what makes a river functional,‚Äù he said, adding that the park had revived a wetland by planting grass species like phragmites and Saccharum spontaneum, which remain intact through floods.

‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt see a river‚Äôs flood as a curse,‚Äù said Khudsar. ‚ÄúIf we have characteristic grasses along the river, and riparian zone vegetation, then the river moves more smoothly.‚Äù

Hundreds of flood-affected people were seen taking shelter at the relief camps near Signature Bridge.

Speaking to ANI, Lakshman Das, an occupant of the relief camp near Signature Bridge said, ‚ÄúWe live in a camp near Signature Bridge. We request the Delhi govt to give us a space to live. We have to relocate every time there is a flood in the area‚Ä¶""

Jagdish, an occupant of the relief camp in Mayur Vihar Phase 1, said that the Delhi government is providing water, food, and ration here.

‚ÄúNow that the water level has increased again, we will have to stay in the camp till the situation goes back to normal...we're getting water, food, tea, and ration from the Delhi government,"" Jagdish said.

A woman recounted the loss caused by overflowing Yamuna River and that if the situation continues she would have no other option but to return to her village.

Another woman staying at the makeshift said that she can't return to her village because her children are in school and the reverse migration would affect their education, ANI reported.

""We are getting, food, and water here. Clean water comes on a tanker. We are jobless as our farms are flooded. We can't even return to village as our children are going to schools,"" she added.

Meanwhile, Delhi government had decided to withdraw the restrictions on entry of vehicles in the national capital after the water level in Yamuna had fallen below the danger mark of 205.33 metres.

The rise in Yamuna water level could be attributed to increased discharge from Hathni Kund Barrage in Haryana and rains in the upper catchment areas, mainly in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The discharge from Hathni Kund barrage rose to 3,60,000 cusecs in July and was recorded at 29,973 cusecs on Friday. One cusec is equal to 28.32 litres per second.

A rise in the water level of the Yamuna could slow down the pace of rehabilitation of flood-affected people living in low-lying areas of Delhi, leading to a prolonged stay of these families in relief camps.

Every day, during the monsoon season, Rakhi Kumari, 18, checks the water levels of the Yamuna river near her house in Delhi. Her family of five, which lives in jhuggis (huts) on the floodplains of the river, has entrusted her with this responsibility.

In early July, when the monsoon was already well under way, Rakhi took a 20-minute walk from her house to the riverside to check if the water level had crossed the danger mark. ‚ÄúThe monsoon season is always alarming for us,‚Äù said Rakhi, who runs a vocational unit in the area and teaches children how to stitch clothes. ‚ÄúEvery year, the floodwater inundates our houses. We have made marks on trees on the river bed. This helps us decide when to pick up our belongings and take them to an elevated area.‚Äù

The Yamuna floodplains span nearly 10,000 hectares of land. They are cleaved by the river, which flows for 54 kilometres across Delhi. The silt deposited by the Yamuna, the longest tributary of the Ganga, sustains many khadars or urban agricultural settlements such as Rakhi‚Äôs. It enriches the soil and fosters crop production.

On that day, Rakhi saw the water level rise, but was relieved to find that it had not crossed the danger mark. However, on July 11, she and her neighbours began to panic as rains lashed the city and they found themselves in knee-deep water in just a few hours. Their jhuggis had never been so inundated in at least a decade. ‚ÄúWhen water is released from the Hathnikund barrage, it usually enters our homes and is ankle-deep. But this time, we found ourselves knee-deep in water. Soon, our houses were completely submerged,‚Äù Rakhi said while feeding her family‚Äôs only remaining buffalo.

Two of the buffaloes had drowned and two were yet to be traced. Rakhi and her family were forced to move to a make-shift tent on a flyover near a metro station. The government has set up some tents on Pusta Road, while other tents have been put up by the residents of Yamuna Khadar.

Delhi saw the highest 24-hour rainfall in 41 years for the month of July on July 9 (153 mm). But while the Yamuna‚Äôs floodwaters kept rising, and reached a peak on July 13, the city received only scattered rainfall. The spate of the Yamuna was due to heavy rainfall in Himachal Pradesh and other upper reaches, which are upstream of Delhi. While the government established relief camps in various areas, not all flood-affected people have received relief, they said.

Several States in north India received record rainfall in July. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), north-west India experienced 59% excess rainfall than what is normal in the first fortnight of July. This occurred due to active monsoon conditions and a passing ‚ÄòWestern Disturbance‚Äô or an extratropical storm originating in Central Asia. The excess rainfall resulted in flooding, water-logging, and loss of property, leaving some areas paralysed for days.

Magnitude of floods

On July 10, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that taking into account various predictions by experts, a substantial increase in the water levels of the Yamuna was unlikely. But at 5 p.m. that day, the river breached the danger mark and continued to rise to an all-time high on July 13.

The Delhi Police asked the residents of Yamuna Khadar, and those in other areas along the river bank, to move to safer places. But many stayed back, fearing loss of property and cattle.

Srinivas Saik, 35, was one of them. As his house flooded, he asked his wife and children to leave on a rescue boat on July 13. ‚ÄúEveryone knows that once you leave your jhuggi, you lose it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) anyway wants us to go.‚Äù

Srinivas took his buffaloes and moved to a nearby stretch on higher ground for four days. From there, he kept an eye on his jhuggi, which was fast disappearing under the rising muddy water. Soon, he realised that the ground on which he had sought refuge was also inundated. He was forced to move again.

Bereft of his possessions, Srinivas sat on a highway, mournfully staring at the plains that were once the source of his livelihood. ‚ÄúFirst the erratic rains partially destroyed our crops. Now, the floods have completely destroyed them. How are we supposed to make ends meet?‚Äù he said.

His neighbour, Rahul Kumar, rued that all the crops that got destroyed were on the verge of being harvested. ‚ÄúFor the next 4-5 months, there will be no harvest and no earnings,‚Äù he said.

Srinivas and Rahul are among the many who have leased land on the floodplains for cultivation. However, despite the losses, they will have to pay rent, said Srinivas. ‚ÄúThe owners will demand the lease instalments and will also take any compensation that comes from the government. We will not get anything,‚Äù lamented Rahul, a farmer whose father migrated to Delhi decades ago from Uttar Pradesh.

The magnitude of the floods in Delhi is prompting khadar settlers to rethink their traditional practice of farming in the floodplains. ‚ÄúIf floods of this magnitude keep happening, we will have to move back to our home towns or find work in another city,‚Äù said Rahul.

This, according to experts, is a high possibility. Torrential rains, and consequently floods, are expected to take place more often, they said. ‚ÄúThe ongoing spell of extremely heavy rains is due to the alignment of three weather systems,‚Äù said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, Meteorology and Climate Change, Skymet Weather. ‚ÄúOne, the Western Disturbance over the Western Himalayas. Two, the cyclonic circulation over the north-western plains. And three, the Axis of Monsoon trough running across Indo-Gangetic plains. This a giant belt of low pressure located in the east-west direction from north-west Rajasthan till the Bay of Bengal. Its movement influences the quantity of rainfall in monsoon.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis alignment is not happening for the first time; it is the usual pattern during the monsoon. However, global warming-led changes in monsoon patterns have made a difference. There has been a constant rise in both land and sea temperatures, which has increased the capacity of the air to hold moisture for a longer time. Thus, the role of climate change in the increasing extreme weather events in India has been strengthening with each passing year,‚Äù he explained.

Encroachments on the floodplains

The journey of the Yamuna through Delhi is uneven. The width of the river can range from 800 metres to 3 km at various stretches. Experts have been saying for decades that the floodplains should be free of encroachments and large settlements, to aid the natural course of the river.

After the 1978 floods in Delhi, the biggest in the city before 2023, a Yamuna Standing Committee had recommended in 1979 that the ‚Äúminimum spacing between future embankments on the banks of the river Yamuna be 5 km and the embankment aligned at a minimum distance of at least 600 m from the ‚Äòactive river edge‚Äô at the time of construction of embankments.‚Äù

In 2014, another committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) observed that ‚Äúunfortunately‚Äù the decision had not been followed and the maximum distance between the two embankments of the river was less than 2 km. As a result, ‚Äúthe floodwater-carrying capacity of the river had been greatly compromised.‚Äù Delhi saw substantial floods in 2010 and 2013 and this, the committee warned, pointed to a ‚Äúgrowing flood hazard‚Äù.

Nine years later, the Yamuna has flooded Delhi again. This time, the flood waters reached the highest-ever recorded level (208.66 m), inundating houses and arterial roads, and forcing thousands to move to relief camps.

‚ÄúThe current situation of the Yamuna floodplains is worse than 2014, when the report highlighted the issue. More illegal encroachments on the floodplains have left less space for the river to flow and for the water to percolate,‚Äù said A.K. Gosain, professor emeritus of the Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, and a member of a Principal Committee appointed by the NGT.

In 1987, a study by the Central Water and Power Research Station, Pune, warned that a reduction in the channel width, and construction of guide bunds on the floodplains, would increase the hazard of flooding on both sides of the river. In the years since, nearly 14 bridges have been constructed between the city‚Äôs Wazirabad and Okhla barrages. These contribute to the city‚Äôs flooding woes, said experts.

In 2015, in a landmark judgment in a case filed by Manoj Mishra, a former Indian Forest Service officer, the NGT formed the Maily Se Nirmal Yamuna Revitalization Plan, 2017, to clean the Yamuna and restore the floodplains by March 31, 2017. The judgment warned of ‚Äúgrave environmental disasters‚Äù. The NGT constituted a Principal Committee to identify all the existing structures in the floodplains and recommend which of them ought to be demolished.

Eight years later, official documents show that this is yet to be done. ‚ÄúNobody is interested. The DDA knows that if these structures are identified, they will have to take further action and even demolish these encroachments,‚Äù Gosain said.

Apart from illegal encroachments, many official developmental works such as the Akshardham Temple, the Commonwealth Games Village, the Yamuna Bank Metro Station, and the Delhi Secretariat are built on the Yamuna floodplains.

The 2015 judgment had also directed the DDA, which is under the Central government, to physically demarcate the floodplains and prohibit construction activities in the demarcated region. ‚ÄúBut when the Principal Committee visited the floodplains, it found that the demarcation was not done properly,‚Äù Gosain said.

As per the DDA‚Äôs Master Plan 2021, the floodplains are termed as ‚ÄòZone O‚Äô. But in the Draft Master Plan 2041, the floodplains have been divided into Zone O-I and O-II. While no construction would be permitted in Zone O-I or the ‚Äòriver zone‚Äô (6,295 ha), regulated development will be allowed in Zone O-II (3,638.36 ha).

‚ÄúWhy should they allow construction in the floodplains by terming it as Zone O-II? The 2015 judgment is clear that there cannot be any construction unless it is extremely important and that too done after careful scrutiny,‚Äù said Gosain.

A.K. Jain, former commissioner (Planning) of the DDA, also said that allowing construction in Zone O-II would be dangerous. When asked why encroachments still happen in floodplains, he said, ‚ÄúThere is political pressure and authorities are not autonomous. There is a nexus of politicians, bureaucrats, and the land mafia.‚Äù

Even the riverfront development project of the DDA includes pavements and permanent structures on the floodplains. ‚ÄúWhen we visited one of the river development sites, there were permanent constructions coming up on the riverfront. This will reduce the absorption capacity of the soil and reduce the area for the river to flow. And because of that, when the water level increases, the river will reclaim its natural flow area,‚Äù said Bhim Singh Rawat, associate coordinator, South Asia Networks on Dams, Rivers and People.

‚ÄúWhenever it comes to our notice that there is encroachment, it is removed,‚Äù a DDA spokesperson said. But the DDA did not respond to specific questions on the other issues.

A political flashpoint

During the floods, the release of water from Hathnikund barrage in Haryana, which is upstream of Delhi, became a political flashpoint between the AAP, which is in power in Delhi, and the BJP, which governs Haryana. The water level of the Yamuna in Delhi depends heavily on the amount of water that is released from barrage.

After the Yamuna enters Delhi at Palla, it flows through Wazirabad to reach ITO, located at the heart of the city, before exiting from the Okhla barrage. The ITO barrage, though located in Delhi, is owned by the Haryana government. The Delhi government has alleged that five of the 32 gates of the barrage were ‚Äústuck,‚Äù which caused the flooding in parts of Delhi.

Haryana government representatives said that the ‚Äúrequired number of gates‚Äù were opened to their maximum limit for safe discharge of floodwater. Even the highest discharge passed without any hindrance, they said. Bhim Singh pointed out that though there are six flood monitoring stations between Hathnikund in Haryana and Old Railway Bridge in Delhi, the Yamuna waters breached the Highest Flood Level only in Delhi, which ‚Äúshowed‚Äù that the problem lay in Delhi.

While the floodplain dwellers are used to moving into tents during the monsoon, those living in the residential parts of the city which abut the Yamuna were taken by surprise. Sandhya Raman, a resident of Civil Lines, said that in the past 30 years, she had never seen the area become so flooded. ‚ÄúFrom my first-floor balcony I could see many cars ‚Äòswimming‚Äô on the main road,‚Äù she said. Her family of four moved to a relative‚Äôs place in Defence Colony for the next four days as electricity was cut off as a precautionary measure.

Even before the Yamuna flooded the city, there was heavy urban flooding due to rains on July 9. Several stretches of the city could not be navigated. Currently, if there is about 100 mm of rainfall in 24 hours, even if the Yamuna flows at normal levels, the city goes under water. Due to urban flooding, in July 2020, a driver, 56, died in a waterlogged stretch under Minto Bridge in the heart of the city. Similarly, in July 2021, a 27-year-old drowned in a waterlogged underpass in Pul Prahladpur.

On June 10, Kejriwal said that Delhi‚Äôs system is not designed to handle ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù rainfall. At the core of this problem is the city‚Äôs drainage master plan, made in 1976, when the population of the city was only about 60 lakh. Since then, the population has increased about four times, but a new drainage master plan is yet to be finalised and implemented by the Delhi government.

In 2011, the Delhi government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with IIT Delhi for a Drainage Master Plan to find a solution to water-logging. Though IIT Delhi submitted the final draft to the Delhi government in 2018, a technical expert committee advised the Delhi government not to accept it. So, the government is now trying to get it done by private players and has floated tenders, but it has not made much headway.

Nishtha Gautam, a resident of Civil Lines, moved to a hotel when her area got flooded. Aware of the possibility of the increasing frequency and magnitude of flooding in the area, Nishtha said that she was pondering a big decision. ‚ÄúGiven Delhi‚Äôs air quality and its susceptibility to such calamities, I am thinking of moving back to my hometown near Mathura,‚Äù she said.

Top updates","The Yamuna water level was recorded at 206.01 meters in Delhi on Monday at 11 pm, which is a level-up from the earlier gradual decrease in the water level of the Yamuna. Earlier on Monday morning, the water level of the Yamuna crossed 205.48 metres . This was slightly above the danger mark of 205.33 metres, even as the waterlogging persisted in several parts of the national capital.

Delhi is in the middle of battling one of its worst flood-like scenarios due to the recent heavy rain, with more than 25,000 people evacuated from inundated areas.

As per the Central Water Commission (CWC), the water level, which had breached the danger mark, flooding vast swathes of the national capital, was recorded at 205.48 at 7 am on Monday down from 206.02 m at 8 am on Sunday.

Here are the Top updates:

-With the water level in the Yamuna showing a rising trend, the Delhi government urged people on Monday to stay put in the relief camps while assuring them that they are not facing any threat, even as some of them returned to their homes and shops to begin the exercise of rebuilding them.

-Delhi Minister Atishi advised people living in relief camps set up by the government in the National Capital to not return to their flood-affected homes since there was a ""slight rise"" in water level in Yamuna River after rains lashed some areas of Haryana a day earlier.

-The water level of the Yamuna, which breached the previous record of 207.49 metres last week and crossed the 208-metre mark on July 12, is still flowing above the danger mark of 205.33 metres.

-The Monastery market, one of the worst-hit places due to the flooding, showed signs of returning to normalcy as shopkeepers came back to clean their shops and assess the damage. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) was also directed to carry out fumigation of the flood-affected areas to avoid the spread of diseases when people return.

-Children who lost their school uniforms and books in the flood will be allowed to attend classes without those until new sets of uniforms and textbooks are arranged for them.

-In view of the decrease in the water level of Yamuna, the Transport Department of the Delhi Government relaxed some of its travel restrictions. The entry of heavy goods vehicles in Delhi will now be restricted only from the Singhu border.

-Moreover, in an order issued by the Transport Department of the Delhi government, it has been said that interstate buses plying from Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand to Delhi's ISBT Kashmiri Gate will be able to reach Singhu border only.

-Earlier, in an order issued on July 13, the entry of heavy vehicles into Delhi was restricted from the Singhu border, Badarpur border, Loni border and Chilla border owing to waterlogging. However, heavy vehicles carrying food items and essentials were excluded from it.

-Meanwhile, IMD had issued a warning with predictions that Delhi will likely receive light to moderate rain accompanied by thunderstorms for the next 4-5 days. However, the flooding in Delhi is not due to localized rain but because the Yamuna River has received a lot of water from Himachal and other states.

Delhi recently experienced an unprecedented spell of rainfall for July, resulting in submerged traffic routes and disruptions to the lives of those residing near the Yamuna Floodplains. Among the heavily waterlogged areas was the underpass on the Ring Road near Nigambodh Ghat, once a railway bridge connecting the medieval Shahjahanabad‚Äôs Red Fort to Salimgarh Fort.

As the road filled with waist-deep rainwater, social media platforms were awash with artworks depicting a time when the Yamuna flowed through the historic Red Fort. However, the river eventually succumbed to urbanisation over the centuries, and this year, 2023, marked a significant rise in Yamuna‚Äôs water level, nearly resembling its historical levels during the Mughal era, albeit at the cost of the suffering of hundreds.

Historians reveal that the Yamuna‚Äôs course might not have always been as we know it today. There remains a possibility that initially, the Yamuna did not flow eastwards but westwards before being captured by the Ganga. Nonetheless, concrete scientific evidence to support this theory remains elusive, despite indications from some research suggesting Yamuna‚Äôs connection to the mythical Sarasvati and its status as a tributary of the Indus.

While the exact course of the Yamuna throughout history remains uncertain, ample evidence suggests that it did capture several rivers that now serve as its tributaries. Geologists Amal Kar and Bimal Ghose discuss the former Drishadvati river system in the Indus basin, often associated with Sarasvati in ancient Hindu scriptures. Through remote sensing techniques, traces of this river system have been identified. The Yamuna captured several tributaries of Drishadvati, such as the Somb and Boli rivers flowing from the Shivalik hills. The reason behind this capture, as the article posits, lies in the typical phenomenon of streams carrying excessive sediment, causing the channel courses to become choked, leading to the opening of new channels.

When urbanisation meets political apathy

The Yamuna holds immense cultural and historical significance, being both a sacred river in Hinduism and a life-source that once sustained thriving empires. However, in recent decades, rapid urban development has repeatedly overlooked the importance of this natural resource. Consequently, flood situations like the recent one have become increasingly common as the waterbody faces contamination due to a confluence of urbanisation, political power plays, and restrictive legislation hindering necessary social action.

During a press conference on July 22, renowned water conservationist and Ramon Magsaysay Award recipient, Rajendra Singh, often referred to as the ‚ÄúWaterman of India‚Äù, highlighted how the recent flood situation in Delhi was entirely man-made and could have been easily avoided. Despite experiencing heavy rainfall before, the water level had never risen to such alarming heights. Singh, credited with the revival of several Yamuna tributaries in Rajasthan, provided valuable insights into the urbanisation of floodplains, the canal, and drainage systems of the river, and their direct link to the flood situation.

Singh criticised the modern-day scientist‚Äôs approach to handling such natural calamities, emphasising the need to adapt and find solutions rather than attempting to control the problem. He pointed out the existence of seven barrages on the Yamuna from Hathni Kund to Okhla, where engineers had informed the governments of Haryana, Delhi, and Uttar Pradesh that opening the barrages could have saved Delhi. However, clearing the canals in the other States would have been necessary to prevent choking from flowing vegetation and debris. Singh questioned why proper arrangements were not made in the first place.

Numerous developmental projects approved by the State in recent decades have neglected the encroachment upon Yamuna‚Äôs territory. In his battle to reclaim Yamuna‚Äôs land from the clutches of urbanisation, Singh approached the Supreme Court, arguing that even completed projects such as the Akshardham temple and the popular locality of Khel Gaon were built on Yamuna‚Äôs land. However, the Court dismissed his plea, ruling that land beyond the constructed embankment on Yamuna does not fall within the floodplain region.

The recent floods have highlighted the futility of attempting to control the natural course of the river through embankments. Reckless urbanisation of the floodplains calls for proper demarcation of blue, green, and red zones, rather than relying on arbitrary embankments. Singh aptly warned, ‚ÄúAn erstwhile capital, Fatehpur Sikri, was devastated by a drought, and the current capital will be ruined by a flood, if proper measures are not taken.‚Äù",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Click here

Saturday‚Äôs rain --- classified in the ‚Äòvery heavy‚Äô category --- was the consequence of monsoon winds interacting with a western disturbance, IMD officials said, which triggered precipitation across much of north-west India.

‚ÄúIf a 24-hour period was considered, then this is the highest single day rainfall at Safdarjung in July since 133.4mm was recorded on July 10, 2003. With Saturday‚Äôs rain coming in just nine hours, it is possible that even this figure gets eclipsed by 8:30 am on Sunday morning,‚Äù said a Met department official. IMD‚Äôs 24-hour period is from 8:30 am until 8:30 am the next day and the IMD says more rain is likely in early hours of Sunday and overnight.

The chaos the rain led to in the Capital serves as a worrying reminder of the city‚Äôs lack of preparedness to tackle the monsoon. The lack is particularly stark as it comes at a time when authorities and agencies are focused on decking Delhi up for the G20 summit due in September. That the situation was not worse for citizens on Saturday was only due to it being a weekend. Delhi needs its civic infrastructure and maintenance to justify its ambition of becoming a world class city.

Safdarjung, representative of Delhi‚Äôs weather, had recorded 3.4mm of rainfall in a 24-hour period till 8:30 am on Saturday morning. In the next nine hours, however, it received 126.1mm of rain. The most rain across Delhi was seen at the Ridge station in north Delhi, where 128mm was recorded in these nine hours, while while Lodhi road recorded 118.2mm. The stations of Delhi University (86mm), Pitampura (83mm) and Pusa (67.5mm) received ‚Äòheavy rain, while moderate spells of 29.6mm at Ayanagar and 17.8mm at Palam were also recorded during this period.

‚ÄúA western disturbance is likely to exhibit very slow movement during the next 24-36 hours. The monsoon trough is running to the south of its normal position extending up to lower tropospheric levels with an embedded cyclonic circulation over southwest Rajasthan,‚Äù the IMD update on Saturday read.

Officials said the beginning of next week is likely to remain rainy. ‚ÄúThere are chances that parts of Delhi received moderate rain on Sunday. Light to moderate rain is again possible on Monday and Tuesday, with the monsoon trough likely to remain close to Delhi NCR,‚Äù the official added.

Very heavy rain spells are fairly rare for the capital, with usually just one such day being recorded in the entire year. The last such spell came on July 1, 2022, when 117.2mm of rain was recorded. In the same year, only two more ‚Äòheavy rain‚Äô days were recorded.

Private forecasters hinted that at least for July, northwest India is currently showing signs of normal monsoon rain recording. ‚ÄúMost parts of northwest India have already achieved the normal rainfall mark for the month, and the forecast shows that similar intensity rain is likely to continue for another two to three days,‚Äù said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet Weather.

In the Capital, the first eight days of the month have brought 164.1mm of rain and by the time the month is over, the long-period average for July at 209.7mm is likely to be surpassed. To be sure, this has been the case in recent years with the city recording more than average amount of rain in 2022 (286.3mm), 2021 (507.1mm) and 2020 (236.9mm).

Delhi‚Äôs maximum on Saturday stood at 28.7 degrees Celsius, which is eight degrees below normal. The minimum was 25 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal. In comparison, the maximum and minimum were 35 and 26.7 degrees Celsius respectively on Friday.

The current water level is 207.55 metres, according to ABP News sources. Thousands of people living in the river's floodplain are being relocated to safer areas in the east, north, northeast, southeast, central and Shahdara districts of Delhi, Saurabh Bharadwaj, Minister of Health, Urban Development and Water, Delhi government, said Tuesday, news agency PTI reported. Bharadwaj said that a flood is highly unlikely in Delhi and that the discharge of a huge quantity of water from Haryana caused the water level of Yamuna to rise.

In 1978, the water level of Yamuna had risen to an all-time record high of 207.49 metres, resulting in devastating floods in the national capital.

Delhi flood: What will happen in the event of Yamuna breaching the 1978 level?

On Tuesday, a day before the Yamuna breached the 1978 level, ABP Live spoke to Dr Anjal Prakash, Research Director, Bharti Institute of Public Policy, Indian School of Business and IPCC Author; and Mr Praveen Tiwari, Co-Founder, Netsol Water Solutions, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, and asked them about the likelihood of floods in Delhi if the Yamuna water level breaches the 1978 flood level.

Both experts said that there is a high likelihood of floods occurring in the regions surrounding the Yamuna river in Delhi, if its water level breaches the 1978 flood level. They explained that the floods can damage infrastructure and may lead to deaths. Moreover, the potential floods can disrupt transportation and restrict access to essential services.

‚ÄúIf the water level breaches the 1978 flood level in the Yamuna river, there is a high likelihood of floods occurring in the surrounding areas. Floodwaters can submerge low-lying areas, including residential neighbourhoods, agricultural fields, and infrastructure like roads and bridges. This can disrupt transportation, compromise access to essential services, and pose a threat to human safety,‚Äù Tiwari said.

Dr Prakash explained that floodwaters can contaminate water sources, and cause widespread displacement, which is why it is important for authorities to monitor the water levels and issue timely warnings.

‚ÄúFlooding can result in significant damage to infrastructure, homes, and agriculture, along with potential loss of lives. Floodwaters can disrupt transportation, contaminate water sources, and cause widespread displacement. It is crucial for authorities to monitor the water levels and issue timely warnings to ensure that appropriate evacuation measures and emergency responses are implemented to mitigate the impact of potential floods,‚Äù Dr Prakash said.

Delhi flood: Comparing 1978 and 2023, does the same amount of rain still cause the same river level rise?

The amount of rain that caused the Yamuna river to reach record-high water levels in 1978 may not have the same impact on the river in 2023 because over the years, measures have been taken to divert and manage the river water.

Dr Prakash and Tiwari explained that efforts have been made to implement water management strategies to mitigate the impact of heavy rainfall on the Yamuna river, and one such measure is the construction of reservoirs and dams upstream to regulate the flow of water. Canal systems have been built to divert water from the river for irrigation.

‚ÄúReservoirs and dams are structures which help in storing excess water during periods of heavy rain and releasing it gradually to prevent sudden surges in river levels downstream. The stored water can be utilised for various purposes such as irrigation, drinking water supply, and hydroelectric power generation. Additionally, canal systems have been established to divert water from the river for irrigation purposes. This practice reduces the reliance on the river for agricultural needs and helps in balancing the water distribution,‚Äù Tiwari said.","

District Magistrate Manish Kumar Verma, who himself went on an inflated boat to inspect low-lying areas submerged in water along the river, issued the order for the closure of schools, PTI reported.

""Due to the high level of water in the Yamuna after heavy rains and in view of chances of rain, the district magistrate has ordered the closure of all schools of all boards on July 14,"" District Inspector of Schools Dharmveer Singh said.

This order will also apply to schools of the Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Council, the Uttar Pradesh Secondary Education Council, the Central Board of Secondary Education, and other boards, the District School Inspector said.

According to the Irrigation Department, the Yamuna crossed the danger mark of 200.60 meters downstream of Okhla Barrage around 11.45 am Thursday.

LG VK Saxena also held a meeting with Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in view of the unprecedented flood situation in the national capital.

The Delhi government said that the water level in the Yamuna river is anticipated to increase to 205.33 meters, which is close to the danger mark of 205.50 meters. The government has asked people living in low-lying areas to be prepared for flooding.

This comes after the Haryana government said that it is releasing water from the Hathnikund Barrage in view of the heavy rains in the state. The government has said that it will continue to release water into the Yamuna river as per the requirement.

The Delhi government has said that it is monitoring the situation closely and is taking all necessary measures to prevent flooding. The government has deployed teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) in low-lying areas.

The government has also asked people to stay away from the banks of the Yamuna river and to follow the instructions of the authorities.

The Delhi government has set up 16 control rooms, including a central control room, to monitor the flood-prone areas and the water level of the Yamuna. The control rooms will be manned by officials from the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), and the Delhi Police.

The CWC has said that the water level in the Yamuna river in Delhi is rising and is expected to surpass the danger mark of 205.33 meters on Tuesday. The CWC has also said that the water level in the river is expected to remain high for the next 2-3 days.

The flood warning comes after heavy rains in Haryana and Uttarakhand. The rains have caused flooding in several parts of these states. The rains are expected to continue in the coming days.

Northwest India has seen incessant rainfall over the last two days, with many areas in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan recording ‚Äúheavy to very heavy‚Äù precipitation.

This has resulted in overflowing rivers, creeks and drains that have massively damaged infrastructure and disrupted essential services in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

Delhi witnessed its highest rainfall in a single day in July since 1982, recording 153 mm rainfall in the 24-hour period ending at 8:30 am on Sunday. Between 8:30 am and 5:30 pm, the city received an additional 105 mm rainfall, exacerbating the situation.

Earlier, in July, heavy rain in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand led to larger-than-normal discharge of water, leading to the Yamuna in Delhi going past the danger mark of 205.33m on July 10, remaining above this level for 15 days. The river crossed the evacuation point of 206m on July 11 to reach a peak of 208.66m on July 13, leading to widespread flooding in Delhi and the displacement of around 28,000 people, for which temporary evacuation camps were set up along roads across seven districts of Delhi.

Over the last couple of weeks, these camps have been removed, and most of the affected people have moved back into their homes. However, if the water level were to rise during the G20 Summit, officials said they have earmarked schools, community halls, and some other areas that will be used as temporary camps.

‚ÄúWe have made basic food and other arrangements. We have also informed NGOs and other groups that additional help may be required in terms of evacuation, transportation, food and medical essentials if the weather turns bad,‚Äù said another district administration official, wishing to remain anonymous.

Meanwhile, flood-affected residents who were living in relief camps said they have been asked to move off the streets, even if their houses are still surrounded by water.

‚ÄúMost flooded areas have dried but some of us still have homes where there is standing water and slush. We can‚Äôt live there yet.

Despite Delhi bearing the brunt of heavy rainfall in the upper reaches such as Himachal Pradesh this monsoon season, environmental experts say that the city is witnessing flooding because of several man-made factors such as illegal construction on the floodplains of the Yamuna.

Experts told The Hindu that apart from illegal structures by private persons, religious sites such as the Akshardham Temple and infrastructure projects like Outer Ring Road have come up on the floodplains.

‚ÄúThe Delhi Secretariat, Commonwealth Games Village, Akshardham Temple and Outer Ring Road have been built on the floodplains. Despite notices being issued by the agencies concerned against the construction of the Akshardham Temple, it was built,‚Äù said Depinder Singh Kapur, director of the Water Programme at the Centre for Science and Environment.

The river has become narrow owing to concrete structures on the floodplains, especially in the 5-km stretch between Civil Lines and Okhla, leading to flooding in these areas and parts of east Delhi, Mr. Kapur said. He added that the current crisis should serve as a warning against concretising riverbanks in the name of riverfront development projects.

‚ÄòProblem is in Delhi‚Äô

Bhim Singh Rawat, associate coordinator, South Asia Networks on Dams, Rivers and People, pointed out that though there are six flood monitoring stations between Hathnikund in Haryana and Old Railway Bridge in Delhi, the Yamuna waters breached the Highest Flood Level (HFL) only in Delhi.

‚ÄúThis shows that the problem is in Delhi. In 1978, more than 7 lakh cusecs of water was released from the Hathnikund barrage and the water level in Delhi was only 207.49 metres. Now, only 3.59 lakh cusecs was released, but the water level went up to 208.66 metres. This shows that there is more flooding in Delhi though less water is coming to the city,‚Äù Mr. Rawat said.

He also held that ‚Äúofficial encroachments‚Äù by governments and ‚Äúunofficial encroachments‚Äù by people were responsible for flooding in the city.

‚ÄúCarrying out construction on the floodplains obstructs the natural flow of the river. So, when the flow increases, the river recaptures its original flow area, flooding these areas,‚Äù Prasoon Singh, a fellow at Climate Change Division, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), said.

Mr. Singh said dredging to remove silt and planned water diversion channels are possible solutions to the problem of flooding, but they can be implemented only after conducting proper studies on them.",issue,Delhi Floods 2023,"Delhi, India","July 14, 2023","July 16, 2023","['Civil Lines', 'Okhla', 'parts of east Delhi']",3.59 lakh cusecs,,,"Flooding in the 5-km stretch between Civil Lines and Okhla, leading to flooding in these areas and parts of east Delhi",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Officials said a probe panel has found the flooding in Delhi occurred due to encroachment of floodplains up to ITO due to which water overflowed to Ring Road. The panel was formed to investigate into allegations that four gates of a Yamuna barrage near ITO in Delhi were not opened during the flood last month.

Due to heavy rains, according to Haryana government, which released a few findings of the report on Wednesday, a significant surge in Yamuna level was witnessed. Due to ‚Äúnon-opening of four gates‚Äù of the barrage near ITO in Delhi, excess water could not be cleared in time causing massive waterlogging and floods, it added.

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar had formed a three-member committee to investigate the matter.

In the report that was furnished, the committee observed that these gates were submerged in flood water that was about 12-feet deep. Besides, they were also filled with silt. These gates can be open only when both upstream and downstream silt around these gates is removed through special techniques, it added. According to the report, no power connection was available to carry out the process. ‚ÄúFloods in Delhi mainly occurred due to excessive encroachment, due to which the water reached up to the Ring Road. Excessive and unplanned construction around the river is obstructing the flow of Yamuna,‚Äù the report stated.

According to the report, during the dry season, the flow of the river stops completely. ‚ÄúThe release of polluted water into the river through various drains leads to the accumulation of silt and rise in the river-bed levels. In such a situation, Delhi government should remove the heavy silt in front of gate number 28 to 32 so that flood water can flow through these gates. The Yamuna‚Äôs natural flood outlets have been systematically encroached upon for decades,‚Äù said the Haryana government while quoting the state probe report.

As electric vehicles are unable to run on flooded roads and autorickshaws and cabs are the only option available. Many people complained that cabs were not easily available and autos were charging double for short distances.

Arti, a 32-year-old domestic worker from Mukherjee Nagar, said rickshaws and autos were charging Rs 100 for a distance that usually costs her Rs 40.

Arti said it was particularly difficult for daily-wage workers like her as the area was facing a complete power outage.

On top of that, she has to pay additional money to obtain water in Chauhan Patti. There is also no bus service available from Chauhan Patti in North East Delhi.

Auto driver Nitin Kumar said: ""There's no more pressure on us as the e-auto drivers have stopped duty because of the flooding. The e-rickshaws drive very slowly anyway. There's no more demand. So naturally, like the airlines exploit the situation by hiking the fare from Rs 3,000 to Rs 50,000, we too have. How can you blame the auto drivers?""

A commuter in GTB Nagar, Monali Sen, said: ""Normally, it takes me an hour to reach office by cab to Indirapuram. However, it took me more than two hours this morning. I got stuck in traffic just as I crossed the Delhi-Ghaziabad border. From there, the traffic moved at a snail's pace until Akshardham.""

She added that the app-based taxis were cancelling on passengers due to the heavy traffic and it took almost 30 minutes to book a cab in the first place. The cab driver charged her the amount that was shown on the app.

App-based taxi aggregators have doubled their travel time charges in the last few days as commuters remained stranded on flooded streets. It was tough for cabbies also to make their way through the flooded streets.

Commuters faced cancellations and long waiting time to book cabs.

Delivery boys, too, had a tough time as they tried to reach their customers. Rishi Kumar, a delivery boy, said: ""Our customers don't think twice before filing a complaint when the delivery is late"".

Delivery boys in several parts of the city are facing significant challenges in fulfilling orders. With waterlogged streets rendering many roads impassable, these delivery personnel are grappling with delays, cancellations and even damage to their vehicles.

Delhi has remained a thought leader in planning with most other master plans across India copying its structure and standards. Cities across the country are flooded during the rains, not for the same reason but for the multiple ways in which their land profile and hydrology has been ignored by the master plans. Ring roads are now a national affliction, choking the surface water flow across the country. Delhi is now going for its third ring road in spite of detailed hydrological studies done decades ago by the National Capital Region Planning Board. Their recommendations were never heeded.

Delhi‚Äôs geography is also well studied, especially after detailed and expensive GIS surveys of the terrain over a decade ago. Once again, these studies never found their way into development decisions. A society obsessed with speed, driven by new wealth and ever-growing automotive production is justifying more and more transportation infrastructure. No political party has the nerve to take tough decisions on transportation infrastructure, parking and pollution.

Once again, even if futile, we must dare to suggest some measures to reduce public misery, enormous recurring economic losses and the post-flood health issues faced by the poor and rich alike. All the while the encroachments on the riverbed, by both planned and unauthorised development, are growing unabated. Massive unauthorised housing encroachments the size of India‚Äôs small cities are growing taller and denser along the river edge. Tunnels and flyovers in low-lying areas are growing in number by the day, while a well-meaning master plan remains unnotified. Delhi is big, so are the Capital‚Äôs egos, development bravado and monumentality of its infrastructure misadventures.

Perhaps it is yet possible to improve the city if the authorities can take some hard-nosed decisions. Can we think of a comprehensive water management master plan? Such a plan could be through collaboration of the Disaster Management Authority, NCR Board, DDA, Delhi State Government and the Irrigation Department. The focus could be to revisit the master plan calculations for water demand and revisiting the GIS-based land analysis, hastening the Delhi government‚Äôs projects for redevelopment of lakes, revisiting waste water recycling to meet at least 50% of Delhi‚Äôs water needs and a blanket ban on development-based invasion of the Yamuna riverbed.

Forget, for once, about vehicular speed and focus on people and their walkability along with localised drainage plans. While technology has moved on, our planning has remained inert and conservative. The ownership of such a water-based master plan should be with the DDA (Delhi Development Authority) with whom the Delhi master plan is vested.

According to government claims, India is the fourth richest country in the world. We have money for big-sized dreams, road networks and for expensive hard sell on most projects. The private sector has never been a closer friend to public bodies. What we need are clarity of vision and gutsy decision makers at the city level, ready to call the shots even if they are uncomfortable.

Estimated losses from floods in city after city are incalculable. Official estimates never include the enormous social and health cost the people, particularly the poor, pay as their homes and livelihoods are simultaneously wiped away by floods. Can we afford to continue taking one step forward and two steps back every monsoon? Enough is enough. Now we need a national action strategy against floods. Every city/settlement has different forms of flood vulnerability. Can we do a statewise time-bound action plan starting with analysis of specificities in landform and hydrological dispositions? We don‚Äôt have a national urbanisation policy since 1988. Can we devise, on a firefighting basis, a national water management plan, decentralised and based on local realities (not on some mega projects like the river-linking idea). Needless to say, such a plan cannot address the disasters we see in the Himalayan region or the impending sea incursions in coastal areas. Those are bigger decisions by centralised bodies. One thing at a time, let‚Äôs fight urban and settlement flooding for now. This can become a big employment generator if we involve the local population in active planning and implementation. Let‚Äôs get real.

Delhi

The Yamuna recently breached its banks and flooded large parts of the city as heavy rains coincided with the release of water from the Hathnikund Barrage upstream, in Haryana. The water levels, which rose to 208.66 metres on July 20, led to Delhi‚Äôs worst floods on record, submerging the Ring Road and leaving Kashmere Gate, Civil Lines, ITO, and Rajghat waterlogged.

THE PROBLEM

There are three primary issues that are causing floods worldwide ‚Äì climate change, urbanisation and reclaiming riverbeds, and deforestation. In Delhi, particularly, we have been developing low-lying areas along the riverbed for decades, be it bridges, underpasses or flyovers. In Seelampur, towards northeast Delhi, for instance, the Delhi Metro reclaimed over 65 acres along the river. Subsequently, there were other projects downstream including the Commonwealth Games village, Akshardham temple and Delhi Metro housing that came up. These have strained the riverbed, reducing its capacity to allow the flow of water.

Likewise, along East Delhi, the flood plains of the Yamuna have been reclaimed. The soil there is sandy, which absorbs water. But now, it has all been concretised.

In South Delhi, private development in areas such as Greater Kailash and South Extension ignored the lay of the land. The carrying capacity of our nullahs have shrunk. We have vandalised the land and haven‚Äôt given it due respect.

Mismanagement of water systems have further aggravated flooding in the city.

THE WAY OUT: Short-term measures will not help. There has to be a comprehensive water management plan that can be strategised quickly, on a war footing. It should look at the urban poor and the riverbeds, but above all, work with water, not against it.

In the Delhi Master Plan, there are provisions for waste and sewage management, supply of drinking water and recycling water. Flooding, too, should be made a component. The 100-year-old flood line will need to be reviewed.

‚ÄòBring the ‚Äòpublic‚Äô into public infrastructure‚Ä¶ need ownership‚Äô

Bengaluru

In a span of seven days in September last year, Bengaluru was marooned twice. While the September 5 rain that submerged the city was unusually high, the city has come to a halt with far less. In May this year, a heavy downpour that lasted just about an hour caused havoc in several parts of the city, claiming the life of a woman who died when the vehicle she was in submerged in the flooded KR Circle underpass.

THE PROBLEM

Bengaluru‚Äôs topography features an undulating landscape, highlighted by a central ridge extending NNE-SSW towards Cauvery and the Pennar rivers. This natural terrain should ideally be enough to facilitate smooth flow of water.

Inadequate engineering practices lie at the root of Bengaluru‚Äôs water management woes. The city‚Äôs Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) has long neglected critical upgrades and a comprehensive infrastructure network. The issues are also systemic. Fragmented contractual responsibilities for maintenance, retaining walls, desilting, disposal etc., only exacerbate the issues plaguing this network. The primary function of the Rajakaluve is to channel surface run off and rain water into the connecting lakes. However their carrying capacity is impacted due to sewage, garbage as well as obstructions built into the drain. This is a classic example of the tragedy of the commons; public property is someone else‚Äôs problem.

THE WAY OUT: In India, the infrastructure challenge often lacks eco-friendliness, but valuable lessons emerge from projects like the K-100 Citizens Waterway project in Bengaluru. By enhancing the sewage network across a 32-sq-km area, we discovered that instilling a sense of ownership encourages better preservation of public spaces. To prevent flooding, it is vital to involve the public in preserving and maintaining our infrastructure. Neglecting the drains undermines efforts to revive the lakes. The aim is to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility within society to safeguard our vital public infrastructure.

Furthermore, while the focus remains on reviving Bengaluru‚Äôs lakes, we must not overlook the critical role of the storm water drain network in replenishing these water bodies. It is a network which is crucial to the health of the city and its lakes.

Create risk maps, need an evacuation strategy‚Äô

MUMBAI

During last year‚Äôs monsoon, several low-lying areas of Mumbai, including Sion, Parel and Dadar, came to a halt on most days between July and September, as rainfall exceeded the 50-mm mark. The Andheri subway, a chronic waterlogging zone of suburban Mumbai, was also shut for vehicular and pedestrian movement. This year too, areas such as Andheri have been facing severe waterlogging.

THE PROBLEM

Mumbai is on the coast, where moisture and winds enter. It‚Äôs the gateway of monsoon winds coming in from the side of the Western Ghats. Now, if this were a city with no buildings, the winds would flow freely. But in Mumbai, we have mixed-used development. Some places have slums, there are high and low-rise buildings, and then some places are hilly. So this leads to turbulence, resulting in more rain. So, in Mumbai, different pockets have heavy rainfall. For instance, if you go from Powai to Navi Mumbai, you will find heavy rains on the Eastern Expressway because there the wind can flow freely. This kind of uneven rainfall is very common in Mumbai, or any urban region.

Advertisement

Now with concretisation in the city, water cannot percolate. But water has to flow out, and when there is high tide, and water cannot flow, it leads to flooding. This has been Mumbai‚Äôs problem. A few days ago, there was heavy rainfall (almost 203.7 mm at Santacruz), but because it did not coincide with high tide, there was minimal water logging.

Development has been random and uncontrolled, especially along riverbeds.

In Mumbai, there is a need to make an assessment of our storm water drains and see if they are capable of handling excessive rain. (Express photo) In Mumbai, there is a need to make an assessment of our storm water drains and see if they are capable of handling excessive rain. (Express photo)

THE WAY OUT: We need to make an assessment of our storm water drains and see if they are capable of handling excessive rain. That should be part of any state-action plan.

Advertisement

We need to then improve early warning systems. While IMD gives us a forecast, it should also give a hind-cast. This means, over the last 10 years, if these kinds of monsoons have happened, what does the data show? With such information, one can have a mental model of how to act. So hindcasts and forecasts are necessary.

Thirdly, an evacuation strategy is important. From pumping out water and saving vulnerable people, we need to have a risk map that will tell you which are the vulnerable areas and how to move people quickly.

Advertisement

In all this, there is also good news. With many positive initiatives by the BMC to pump out water quickly and clean up drains, water logging in many areas have reduced in the past few years.

‚ÄòWe need stronger legal systems‚Äô

KOCHI & OTHER KERALA CITIES

Kerala witnessed its worst-ever floods in mid-August 2018 when low-lying areas and cities in four districts of central Kerala got submerged following days of torrential rains, coupled with the unexpected opening of dams in the higher ranges. Parts of Kochi, its suburban areas and several townships along the course of River Pamba remained submerged for days. Hundreds of people lost their lives in the calamity, reckoned as the worst in a century.

THE PROBLEM: Almost all of Kerala is urban. We have nearly 4,000 people per sq km, that‚Äôs roughly three times the national density. Also, our settlement pattern is like a farmstead ‚Äì we may be urban but almost everyone looks for an independent plot of land with a well and some coconut trees. With this comes the problem of encroachment. The Kerala Master Plan does not have a demarcation for where one can build and where one cannot. That‚Äôs one of the primary reasons why floods happen.

Secondly, the geography of the land. If you drop a ball at the Western Ghats, it will roll all the way into the Arabian Sea. The land is full of contours. Traditionally, with the rains, the rivers would swell up and deposit slurry along the farmlands, making the soil fertile for farming.

However, today, with unplanned buildings, the contours of the land are being ignored, both in macro- and micro-planning. The Cochin Airport at Nedumbassery is an example. It‚Äôs built along the flood plains of the Periyar, because of which with heavy rains, it gets flooded.

(Express photo) Kerala witnessed its worst-ever floods in mid-August 2018 when low-lying areas and cities in four districts of central Kerala got submerged following days of torrential rains. (Express photo)

THE WAY OUT: We need strong legal systems in place to ensure future structures follow the lay of the land, allow water to percolate, and don‚Äôt narrow down streams. These days through technological simulations we can assess what buildings will do to flood prone areas, let‚Äôs do those studies before we build.

‚ÄòMake communities the custodians‚Äô

SHIMLA & HILL TOWNS

Since the onset of monsoon in Himachal Pradesh on June 24, over 150 people have died in rain-related incidents such as landslides, flash floods and cloudbursts, besides road accidents, according to the Himachal Pradesh State Emergency Response Centre.

THE PROBLEM: The Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) mentions the vulnerabilities of the Himalayan states and coastal areas. Much of the flooding in recent years has to do with human-induced interventions.

In Himachal, one has seen two major changes in development. First was in the 1970s, when the State played a role in social infrastructure. Every house had electricity but that abruptly ended in the post-liberalisation era, post ‚Äô90s.

While development was rapid, we had to generate our own money. For that, we turned to our natural resources ‚Äì forests and its hydro potential. The World Bank came in and so did private players. But this was done at the cost of nature.

Many of these projects were along the rivers. Conduits were created and tunnels built, new technologies were introduced, and massive dams were built. But this completely finished us. And then, there was deforestation.

Tourism was the other attraction. Roads were extended, especially along the Shimla-Chandigarh and Shimla-Manali routes. Unlike what we have been doing in the past, when we earlier cut mountains, these were terraced so that we don‚Äôt destroy the entire ecology, now it‚Äôs a vertical slit, mountains are cut from top to bottom; it‚Äôll take decades to restore these roads.

The Himachal Pradesh government had deployed SDRF and NDRF personnel to clear the roads amid flooding and landslides. (Express Photo) The Himachal Pradesh government had deployed SDRF and NDRF personnel to clear the roads amid flooding and landslides. (Express Photo)

THE WAY OUT: The answer to all this, I believe, is disruption ‚Äì not what is to be done but how it has to be done. It‚Äôs putting people at the core. I‚Äôm asking for a commission of enquiry so that we can start discussions on what has gone wrong. I feel people should have the veto power ‚Äì to say no to large dams, have a say in the industries we want and what kind of tourism we should have.

There should be new paradigms of the architecture of governance. Communities should be made custodians and some kind of insurance model should be developed, so that we don‚Äôt have to go to MLAs when such a crisis happens.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Though flood water may have continued to recede in the national capital, it has caused heavy damage to the daily wager community, which is a significant part of the population in the national capital.

The savings of such families have depleted massively as their working hours shrunk.

The flood water disrupted their work and earning, which led to the depletion of their savings. As a result, many such daily wagers' kids are dropping out of school.

The Voice of Slum, an NGO working for the slum dwellers, conducted a survey on floods-affected daily wagers and gathered appalling data regarding the loss the community has suffered.

""We collected data from four areas - Yamuna Khadar near Madanpur, Shaheen Bagh and Bawana in Delhi and Noida. We have found that an average daily wager is losing about Rs 400-500 daily since the water has entered their accommodations. They have also lost many household items, which were precious to them. The average loss so far among 100 dwellers of such colonies mounts up to Rs 30 lakh,"" said Dev Pratap Singh, founder of the Voice of Slum.

""Now since the water is yet to recede completely, the daily wagers are losing their savings. As a result, the diet of their family has shrunk and their children are not going to school. There‚Äôs uncertainty about whether they will ever go to school,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe problem will continue when the water recedes completely. Their livelihoods have been impacted for a longer period of time. It might take them a whole year to reach the pre-flood-like financial condition, with the hope that next year there'll be no floods. These are the casualties of climate change-led natural calamities,"" he added.

After Yamuna in Delhi, the Hindon River is now wreaking havoc in neighbouring Ghaziabad and Noida with people being evacuated from the flood plains of the river.

The unauthorised colonies, home to the daily wagers, which were constructed on flood plains are now facing threat due to the rise in water levels.

""We are working on a long-term solution for these daily wagers. The government needs to know that the frontline of climate change is here. Our focus is to not only to provide immediate relief but also to chalk out a plan for the kids to continue their schooling and adults to continue earning their livelihoods as their savings, which was not much anyways, is depleting at a fast pace,"" Singh stressed.

The flood situation in the national capital of Delhi worsened further on Thursday, with water levels in the Yamuna rising to record levels, threatening the people living in close proximity to the river.As per the Central Water Commission, Yamuna water levels in Delhi surged to a record 208.48 metres at 8 a.m. It warned that the water levels are likely to rise to 208.75 metres by 4 p.m.Meanwhile, the Civil Lines area of Delhi got flooded today. Several areas of the city are also reeling under floods and waterlogging as the water level of the Yamuna River continues to rise following heavy rainfall and the release of water from Hathnikund Barrage.There are two major barrages on the Yamuna -- Dakpathar in Dehradun and Hathnikund in Yamunanagar, upstream of Delhi. There are no dams on the river, and, therefore, most of the monsoon flow remains unutilised, resulting in floods during the season.Delhi recorded a rapid increase in the Yamuna's water level over the past four days.It shot up from 203.14 metres at 11 a.m. on Sunday to 205.4 at 5 p.m. on Monday, breaching the danger mark of 205.33 metres 18 hours earlier than expected.The river exceeded the evacuation mark of 206 metres on Monday night, prompting the relocation of people residing in flood-prone areas to safer locations and the closure of the Old Railway Bridge for road and rail traffic. The water level breached the previous all-time record of 207.49 metres by 1 p.m. on Wednesday and the 208-metre mark by 10 p.m.Delhi Water Minister Saurabh Bharadwaj had earlier told reporters that the city government is prepared to deal with the situation.""We are monitoring the situation and all possible steps are being taken,"" he said.Embankments are being constructed in the low-lying areas to prevent the entry of floodwater into other parts of the national capital in case the Yamuna's water level rises further.Major floods in Delhi occurred in 1924, 1977, 1978, 1988, 1995, 1998, 2010 and 2013. Analysis of flood data from 1963 to 2010 indicate an increasing trend for floods occurring in September, and a decreasing trend in July, according to research.Experts attributed the situation to the encroachment of floodplains, extreme rainfall in a short period of time, and the accumulation of silt that elevated the riverbed.Manu Bhatnagar, principal director of the Natural Heritage Division at the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, identified extreme rainfall in a short duration as the primary reason for the Yamuna raging in Delhi.According to The Energy Resources Institute, the uneven distribution of rainfall, combined with uncontrolled urbanisation and the encroachment upon natural drainage channels and urban lakes, is contributing to the alarming rise in flood occurrences within the city.The unchecked filling of urban water bodies has become a prevalent issue. The proliferation of illegal colonies throughout the city, disregarding proper planning measures, has led to the narrowing of natural drainage systems. This poses a grave threat to the city's well-being and serves as an open invitation to urban flooding, it said.Over 16,500 people living in low-lying areas have been shifted to safer places at higher altitudes, news wire agency PTI had reported on Wednesday.The report quoting govt officials said that 45 boats have been deployed for awareness, evacuation and rescue work and NGOs have been roped in to provide relief to the evacuated people.Delhi witnessed its highest rainfall (153 mm) in a single day in July since 1982 in the 24-hour period ending at 8.30 am on Sunday. The city received an additional 107 mm rainfall in the subsequent 24 hours, exacerbating the situation. The heavy rain transformed roads into gushing streams, parks into watery labyrinths and marketplaces into submerged realms.The low-lying areas near the river in Delhi, inhabited by around 41,000 people, are considered prone to flooding. Encroachments on the river's floodplain have occurred over the years, despite the land belonging to the Delhi Development Authority, the Revenue Department and private individuals.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Common diseases caused by waterlogging

Dr Dharmendra shares top 10 illnesses that can be caused due to waterlogging

Water pollution resulting from waterlogging can facilitate the spread of different waterborne diseases like cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis A. These illnesses occur due to the consumption of water containing faeces or harmful microorganisms. Also, the accumulation of stagnant water caused by waterlogging creates a favourable environment for mosquitoes and other vectors that carry disease-causing pathogens. In areas with stagnant water, diseases spread by mosquitoes, such as dengue fever, malaria, and the Zika virus, can rapidly propagate.

1. Gastrointestinal infections

The occurrence of waterlogging increases the chances of contracting gastrointestinal infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites. This can result in various common ailments like gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, and dysentery, which are primarily spread through contaminated water or food.

2. Respiratory diseases

Continuous exposure to damp and mouldy surroundings due to waterlogging can act as a catalyst for respiratory issues such as asthma, bronchitis, and allergic rhinitis. The release of mould spores into the air can worsen pre-existing respiratory conditions.

3. Skin infections

Extended exposure to waterlogged areas can result in the development of different skin infections, including dermatitis, eczema, and fungal infections. The excessive moisture, coupled with the presence of bacteria and fungi, creates an optimal environment for the proliferation of these infections.

4. Leptospirosis

Waterlogging is frequently linked to leptospirosis, which is a bacterial infection. The bacteria can enter the body through cuts or abrasions, leading to a range of symptoms from a mild flu-like illness to severe complications that affect vital organs such as the liver, kidneys, and lungs.

5. Eye infections

The occurrence of waterlogging can heighten the chances of eye infections such as conjunctivitis and keratitis. Pathogens present in the water, combined with prolonged exposure to damp conditions, can contribute to the development of these infections, resulting in symptoms such as redness, itching, and discomfort.

6. Meningitis

The presence of waterlogging in certain areas raises the risk of meningitis, which is characterised by inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Bacterial or viral infections, transmitted through contaminated water sources, can give rise to this potentially life-threatening condition.

7. Dengue fever

The accumulation of stagnant water in waterlogged areas creates an ideal breeding habitat for Aedes mosquitoes, which are responsible for transmitting the dengue virus. Dengue fever can result in severe flu-like symptoms such as a high fever, headaches, and joint and muscle pain. In severe cases, it can even lead to haemorrhagic fever.

8. Chikungunya

Like dengue fever, Chikungunya is also transmitted by mosquitoes that breed in waterlogged areas. It manifests with symptoms such as fever, joint pain, rash, and fatigue, which can persist for prolonged periods and greatly affect an individual's quality of life.

Dr Aditya Chowti, Senior Consultant- Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital, Cunningham Road, Bengaluru ads more monsoon illnesses to the list.

9. Cholera

It is an acute diarrheal illness caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Cholera spreads through contaminated water or food, and symptoms include watery diarrhoea, vomiting, muscle cramps, and dehydration.

10. Typhoid fever

This serious bacterial infection is caused by Salmonella typhi. It spreads through contaminated food or water. Symptoms of typhoid fever include fever, headache, fatigue, cough, constipation, and rose-coloured spots on the chest and abdomen.

11. Hepatitis A

It is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus, which spreads through contaminated food or water. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, and dark urine.

12. Malaria

Malaria is a mosquito-borne illness caused by the Plasmodium parasite. Symptoms include fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, and fatigue.

To prevent waterlogging and reduce the risk of associated diseases, Dr Chowti suggests you to consider the following measures:

Improved drainage: Implement effective drainage systems to allow excess water to flow away, preventing water accumulation.

Construct embankments to prevent water from flowing into specific areas. Flood control measures: Utilize flood control methods such as levees and dams to prevent flooding, which can lead to waterlogging.

Additionally, take precautions to prevent the spread of diseases caused by waterlogging:

Consume safe water: Drink only bottled or boiled water and avoid drinking water from potentially contaminated sources such as streams, rivers, or lakes.

Drink only bottled or boiled water and avoid drinking water from potentially contaminated sources such as streams, rivers, or lakes. Practice proper hygiene: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially before eating, after using the toilet, and after changing diapers.

Click here A screengrab from a video circulating on social media, which shows Anupam Mehta saving dogs at a flooded animal shelter. (Photo: Instagram)

The efforts in Shastri Nagar were primarily aimed at rescuing cows, and in parts of NCR such as Noida Sector 135, the immense flooding led to one of the shelters of the organisation being closed down. ‚ÄúDue to the closing of the shelter, more than 250 animals had to be taken to the Friendicoes‚Äô shelters in Defence Colony and Jangpura. Here they were given first aid and medical attention. We even saw some cases of hypothermia in some dogs, for which we called a veterinarian to give them immediate aid.‚Äù

NDRF personnel have carried out rescue missions across the flood affected areas in Noida.

Several personnel from the NRDF have been spotted rescuing more than 2,500 cows from numerous gaushalas (cow shelters), which are now submerged. An official from the department, says on condition of anonymity: ‚ÄúThe cattle along with humans, whose homes were damaged in the floods, have been moved to Pusta Road as part of the 24-hour rescue mission.‚Äù

Over 2,500 dogs have moved out of the flooded shelters, and are being fed by the volunteers at Save A Stray.

These displaced animals are now housed in boarding shelters provided by NGOs such as Friendicoes, All Creatures Great and Small (ACGS) and Wildlife SOS. ‚ÄúAfter the rescues are done, the biggest hurdle for any displayed person or animal is food or shelter. That is where we come in,‚Äù shares Vidit Sharma, founder, Save A Stray. He adds: ‚ÄúThere are more than 10 centres where animals are currently staying and each of them has at least 250 dogs. We are taking care of their food requirements by feeding them thrice a day. Countless good Samaritans have come forward to donate generously. That‚Äôs how these animals are getting taken care of in these difficult times.‚Äù

Volunteers from ACGS have rescued hundreds of stray dogs, goats, and sheep from Yamuna Khadar Road.

Some volunteers such as Khushboo Nahar, an advocate based in Mayur Vihar Phase-1, who has been part of some of the rescue missions, shares the heart-wrenching situation and why more good Samaritans need to come forward: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm volunteering at the Yamuna Khadar Road near the Mayur Vihar 1 metro station with ACGS. Our job is to ensure that the animals feel safe and comfortable enough to come into the wooden boats so they can be rowed to high and dry lands... It‚Äôs not an easy task since they are scared and some of the dogs can get a little aggressive. But it‚Äôs all water under the bridge; we want to help out in whatever way we can.‚Äù

As far as the DDA is concerned, the provision of regulated development proposed in the draft is capable of restricting further encroachment of the river floodplain and further unauthorised construction,"" an official, requesting anonymity, said.According to Master Plan 2021, Zone O comprises the entire floodplain along the 22-km stretch of the Yamuna falling in Delhi - from Wazirabad to Palla - spread over 10,000 hectares. In the draft Master Plan of 2041, DDA has divided Zone O into Zone O-I and Zone O-II, which is the floodplain. While no construction will be permitted in Zone O-I, or the 'river zone', regulated development will be allowed in Zone O-II. The draft Master Plan, 2041, was approved in a meeting chaired by the LG in March and is with the ministry and has yet to be notified.Sources said that after the flood, there has been a point of view that the plan should be relooked at, keeping in view how the recent flood had inundated several residential areas that have come up in Zone O-II.Several experts, too, have been demanding that the government should reconsider its decision to delineate the Yamuna in view of the recent floods. While the DDA claims the delineation was crucial to ensure no further illegal development happened on the floodplain, the experts say the exercise would lead to extension in unauthorised construction. The problem of flooding could further intensify in colonies built on the floodplains every time there is heavy rain and high discharge of water from the Hathnikund barrage in Haryana.The river zone (O-I) is spread over 6,295 hectares while the regulated riverfront (Zone O-II) is 3,638 hectares. There are about 76 unauthorised colonies in Zone O-II.

Click here

The Safdarjung station, representative of the city‚Äôs weather, has received 775.8mm rain so far this year, surpassing the annual average of 774.4mm, with 12 days remaining in August ‚Äî the city‚Äôs wettest month ‚Äî and more than a third of the year still to come, according to data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

The city passed this threshold even sooner in 2021, when it got 780.1mmof rain by August 1, and 1,526.8mm of rain all year. Last year, Delhi recorded 811.4mm of rain.

To be sure, the city logs a bulk of its rainfall in the monsoon months of June, July and August. The last four months of the year only receive a combined 152.6mmof rain.

Still, showers on Saturday morning took commuters by surprise and inundated several parts of the Capital, with reports of waterlogging in Najafgarh, Punjabi Bagh and neighbourhoods along the Outer Ring Road.

Shivam Chouhan, a resident of Patparganj, said, ‚ÄúI almost missed my flight in the morning as traffic was very slow because of the rains. This was exacerbated by people taking shelters at several places under flyovers, blocking other vehicles.‚Äù

Traffic police officers said they sent real-time alerts out to inform commuters of the waterlogging in a bunch of areas and also stationed extra personnel to help keep traffic moving.

‚ÄúWe deployed more personnel around Outer Ring Road and at the Delhi-Gurugram border, but traffic remained smooth as it was a weekend. Flooding cleared out in most of the waterlogged areas quickly,‚Äù said a traffic police officer.

Authorities in Delhi have been on alert for weeks, after Yamuna‚Äôs waters hit record levels in July, forcing the administration to evacuate people living on the river‚Äôs floodplains en masse and disrupting life in the city for days.

Even as officials pointed to the river‚Äôs swelling waters ‚Äî which peaked at 208.66m on July 13, above the danger mark of 207.33m ‚Äî for those floods, experts said the city‚Äôs archaic sewerage network and the lack of a proper drainage master plan had only compounded the Capital‚Äôs miseries.

Once again, though, Gurugram bore the brunt of the rain, with swathes of Millennium City going under on Saturday, leaving commuters on the road for several hours amid bumper-to-bumper queues as traffic came to a standstill.

According to the weather department, Gurugram received 62mm of rainfall in the 24 hours till 5.30pm on Saturday.

The busy NH-48 was hit the hardest, though few neighbourhoods were spared in what has been a recurrent problem for the city for years now.

Experts and residents have blamed Gurugram‚Äôs poor drainage network, unplanned constructions and ever-mushrooming traffic for the persistent rain mess.

Officials said they received complaints of flooding from the Narsinghpur stretch of the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, areas near Iffco Chowk Metro station, as well as neighbourhoods in and around Hero Honda Chowk, Rajiv Chowk, Vatika Chowk, Iffco Chowk, Kherki Daula, Golf Course Extension Road, Southern Peripheral Road, Udyog Vihar, Sohna Road, Basai, Khandsa Road and Pataudi Road.

Delhi has recorded rain every month this year so far, except February, and the actual rain has been higher than normal in all of these months.

In January, the city clocked 20.4mm of rain, as against a normal of 19.1mm. In March, Delhi got 53.2mm, against the normal of 17.4mm. This number fell to 20.1mm in April (when the normal is 16.3mm), rose to 111mm in May (30.7mm), 101.7mm in June (74.1mm) and 384.6mm in July (209.7mm).

So far this month, the Capital has received 84.8mm of rain.

IMD predicted some light rain for the city in the days ahead.

‚Äò‚ÄúGenerally cloudy skies with light rain or drizzle may be seen till Tuesday with possibility of thundershowers. The days will remain hot,‚Äù the agency said in its forecast on Saturday.

Despite the showers, Delhi was hotter than usual on Saturday.

The ITO barrage has 32 gates and the authorities had started opening gates from left to right but the last five of these gates could not be opened.The gates were submerged in flood water about 12 feet deep and they were also filled with silt. These gates can be open only when both upstream and downstream silt around these gates is removed through special techniques, the report highlighted.""Agency then started the work under water with the help of a pneumatic compressor and divers to remove the sludge/silt.

Incessant rainfall in north India for the past few days and the release of water from Hathni Kund Barrage have resulted in an all-time high water level of the Yamuna river in the national capital. The water level in Yamuna is likely to reach 208.3 m by 9am on Thursday, according to the latest flood forecast by Central Water Commission.

Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said Union minister Gajendra Shekhawat has informed him that the volume of water being released to Haryana from Himachal Pradesh has reduced, which in turn will impact the water level in the Yamuna.

However, he said it will take some time for the water level in the river to recede.

In a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Kejriwal requested that ""if possible, the water from the Hathnikund barrage in Haryana be released in limited speed"" and pointed out that Delhi is set to host the G20 Summit meeting in a few weeks.

""Following my letter, I got a call from Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who said that Hathnikund is just a barrage and there is no reservoir to store water and limit the water speed. The water volume being released from Himachal Pradesh has reduced and the situation will improve. But it will take time to reflect in the water level of the Yamuna,"" he said at a press conference after the meeting.

But the latest forecast of heavy rainfall in Himachal Pradesh from July 14 may subsequently result in increasing the water level in Yamuna and worsen the flood-like situation in parts of Delhi.

Meanwhile, Kejriwal has requested those living in low-lying areas in the vicinity of Yamuna to vacate their homes immediately.

Delhi LG VK Saxena has called a meeting of Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday over the rising water level of Yamuna, reported PTI quoting Raj Niwas officials.

Indian Navy personnel are also assisting the Delhi administration to get the barrage running at full capacity soon to avoid further chaos in case of heavy rains or a further rise in Yamuna water levels.

Mr Kejriwal also said his government would request its Haryana counterpart to hand them over the management and maintenance of the ITO barrage.

There are three barrages inside Delhi -- Wazirabad Barrage, ITO Barrage, and Okhla Barrage. The Delhi government handles the Wazirabad barrage, Haryana government is responsible for the ITO barrage, and the management of Okhla Barrage is with the government of Uttar Pradesh.

The Aam Aadmi Party chief further said there's nobody in particular to blame as all the water is coming from upwards.

""There was no rain in Delhi except for one day. All the water is coming from Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. This is not our local water. Delhi till now didn't have the capacity to handle such volume of water. The water level in Yamuna has crossed 207.5 after 45 years. This is a huge crisis, where everyone should work together instead of blaming one another,"" Arvind Kejriwal said.

He also warned people not to click selfies near the flooded areas, and take precautions, as the threat is not over yet.

""Reports are coming from several places that some people are going to play or swim or take selfies or shoot videos in waterlogged places. Please do not do this. It can be fatal. The threat of flood is not over yet.

‚ÄúBy morning, the water had entered our house. We moved our belongings to the top shelves and by around noon, we were left with no option but to move to the relief centre,‚Äù said Shehzadi, who has lived in the area for more than two decades.

She was among the nearly 50 people that had taken shelter at the government relief centre until Thursday evening. In addition to documents such as the Aadhar card, she carried some bags with pots and pans and some buckets. However, Shehzadi rued that she had left behind many important possessions including her four goats. ‚ÄúI cannot stop thinking about my goats. They are locked inside the hut,‚Äù said Shehzadi.

Shayera, another area resident who took shelter at the relief centre, said, ‚ÄúThis is the first time that I have seen such floods in Delhi. I was worried and just picked up one set of clothing and left the house when the water level started rising in the morning. We could not carry the cylinder and cannot cook food anymore.

Civil defence volunteers stationed at the site shared that nearly 50 people had reached the centre and the numbers were expected to increase. ‚ÄúWe have been making announcements since last night, asking people to leave for their own safety.

""I am still waiting for the invitation. It's been six months. If the invitation comes today, I am ready to visit his house,"" Himanta said. On Friday, there was waterlogging near Kejriwal's house in Delhi's Civil Lines. Himanta Biswa Sarma said he is ready to visit Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal's house.

""In Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, urban floods take place. Guwahati too gets urban flood. We all have our issues but the atmosphere where a chief minister derides another state should change,"" Himanta said as one one lakh people in Assam are affected by floods. In Assam, the flood situation worsened after Bhutan released excess water from the Kurichu dam after informing the Assam government.

On July 13, when the Yamuna water level broke all past records with the water starting to enter the Capital, Himanta put out a tweet which he later deleted. ""...after witnessing the current state of Delhi on national television, I feel much more comfortable in my own city Guwahati. I dread watching his 'work',"" Himanta tweeted and it was later deleted.

Assam AAP unit took offence over the tweet and said if Himanta Biswa Sarma goes to Delhi even during the flood, he will find better management, governance and relief operations. ""It's a natural calamity plus vendetta politics of BJP which deliberately released uncontrolled water towards Delhi of equally sharing it with UP,"" AAP's Rajesh Sharma said.

Kejriwal vs Himanta Biswa Sarma

Kejriwal versus Himanta Biswa Sarma goes a long way starting during the pandemic. Former Delhi minister Manish Sisodia linked Sarma's wife Riniki Bhuyan with a PPE kit row in Assam against which Riniji filed a defamation suit against Sisodia, who is now in jail. After that, Kejriwal and Himanta fought over their job claims and then Kejriwal said he would like to take Himanta Sarma on a tour to Delhi's schools and hospitals. To this, Himanta said he accepts the invitation but he will visit the places where he wants to go, not where Kejriwal wants to take him.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Devi and Shivakumar had to flee their hut on the banks of the Yamuna River, which passes through Delhi, earlier this month as water levels rose without warning.

‚ÄúThis is how deep the water was,‚Äù said Devi, pointing to her chin.

The family, like thousands of others, has taken refuge on the roadside kerb, 100 meters (328 feet) from their now-flooded hut.

Their story is similar to that of millions of others in South Asia who are on the front line of climate change. According to the World Bank, climate change could force 216 million people to migrate within their own countries by 2050. In South Asia alone, 40.5 million people are expected to be displaced.

‚ÄúThe extreme rains in India‚Äôs Himalayan states are just the latest in a series of events in South Asia that are exacerbated by climate change,‚Äù said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at the Climate Action Network International.

‚ÄúWe saw unprecedented and devastating floods in Pakistan earlier this year. We are facing melting glaciers in Nepal and Pakistan, rising seas in India and Bangladesh, and cyclones and inhospitable temperatures across the region. Climate change is increasingly forcing millions of people to flee their homes in search of safety and new means to provide for their families,‚Äù he added.

For Devi and others who live in Yamuna Khadar, on the floodplains of the Yamuna River, being dislocated by floods has become a way of life. The latest displacement was a consequence of extreme rainfall in upstream states that resulted in the swelling of rivers and the opening of many dams that were unable to hold the excess water.

Devi and Shivakumar are originally from the Budayun region in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, about five hours by road from Delhi. In Budayun, their homestead, which was 2km (1.24 miles) from the Ganges River, also repeatedly flooded. Unable to farm successfully because of unseasonal extreme weather, they decided to escape to Delhi to create a better life for themselves some 15 years ago.

In Delhi, they grow vegetables on a small patch of land in the Yamuna River‚Äôs floodplains to make ends meet. But as in Budayun, flooding and other extreme weather in Delhi are taking away the little they possess.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

The water level at the Old Railway Bridge rose from 203.86 metres at Friday 8 am to 205.29 metres by 3 pm, according to the flood control room.

The water level started rising in the Yamuna river owing to heavy rain in upper catchment areas, this further prompted to city government to chalk out a strategy to evacuate people from low-lying areas.

A flood control department official said, ‚ÄúA flood alert is declared in Delhi when the discharge rate from the Hathnikund Barrage in Haryana's Yamuna Nagar crosses the 1 lakh-cusecs mark. People living near the floodplains and in flood-prone areas are evacuated then.""

On Thursday, the flood control department instructed all sector officers to remain vigilant in their respective areas and take necessary action at vulnerable points by deploying the requisite number of quick-reaction teams to warn people residing within river embankments. Thirty-four boats and mobile pumps have been deployed in anticipation of floods in low-lying areas.

Typically, the flow rate at the Hathnikund barrage is 352 cusecs, but the discharge increases after heavy rainfall in the catchment areas. The water discharged from the barrage normally takes two to three days to reach the national capital.

Last year, the Yamuna river breached the danger mark on July 30 and the water level at the Old Railway Bridge had risen to 205.59 metres.

In 2019, the flow rate had peaked at 8.28 lakh cusec on August 18-19, and the water level of the Yamuna had hit the 206.60-metre mark. The Delhi government had to launch evacuation and relief operations after the overflowing river submerged many low-lying areas.

The water level of the Yamuna river breached the danger mark of 205.33 metres in Delhi following heavy rain in upper catchment areas, prompting authorities to chalk out a strategy to evacuate people from low-lying areas.

The Delhi flood control room said the water level reached 205.38 metres at 4 p.m. on Friday. It had issued a warning on Thursday night.

The water level at the Old Railway Bridge rose from 203.86 metres at Friday 8 a.m. to 205.29 metres by 3 p.m., according to the flood control room.

A flood alert is declared in Delhi when the discharge rate from the Hathnikund Barrage in Haryana's Yamuna Nagar crosses the 1 lakh-cusecs mark. People living near the floodplains and in flood-prone areas are evacuated then, an official said.

The flood control department on Thursday advised all sector officers to keep a vigil in their respective areas and take necessary action at vulnerable points by deploying the requisite number of quick-reaction teams to warn people residing within river embankments.

Thirty-four boats and mobile pumps have been deployed in anticipation of floods in low-lying areas.

East Delhi District Magistrate Anil Banka said, ""Around 37,000 people who live in Yamuna-floodplains and low-lying areas in Delhi are considered vulnerable to flooding. We have shared a flood control plan with all departments concerned."" ""We have been making announcements urging people to shift to safer areas. Evacuation efforts will start if the water level crosses the 206-metre mark. It may happen this evening or tomorrow morning."" The people will be shifted to temporary structures like tents and permanent buildings like schools in safer areas, Banka said.

The Delhi flood control room reported a discharge rate of around 2.21 lakh cusecs from the Hathnikund Barrage at 3 p.m. on Thursday and 1.55 lakh cusecs at midnight. It was 97,460 cusecs at 6 a.m.

One cusec is equivalent to 28.32 litres per second.

Normally, the flow rate at the Hathnikund barrage is 352 cusecs, but the discharge increases after heavy rainfall in the catchment areas. The water discharged from the barrage normally takes two to three days to reach the national capital.

According to the India Meteorological Department, heavy to very heavy rainfall occurred at a few places in Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday.

""Widespread rainfall with isolated heavy rain is likely in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Haryana on August 14 and 15,"" it said.

Experts warn of climate change","NEW DELHI : Climate change has been peeking round the corner, when several countries took some steps to counter the damage done. However, experts have only warned that several parts on earth will only continue to reel under severe heatwave conditions as maximum temperatures continue to soar.

Many scientists have also said that the menace of climate change is set to be perennial and worsen as searing winds blow across swathes of north India. Under its influence, National capital Delhi recorded temperatures above 49 degrees Celsius and Assam recorded flash floods.

Delhi neighbour Gurgaon also recorded 48 degrees Celsius, the highest since May 1966 on Sunday. Following this experts analysed the incidence of extreme weather events and sounded a dire warning.

‚ÄúWith increasing temperatures as a result of global warming in South Asia and the consequent exceeding levels of heat and humidity, it is predicted that we will have more intense, longer and frequent heat waves in India,"" environmentalist and climate scientist Shakil Ahmad Romshoo told news agency PTI in a phone interview from Srinagar.

According to the University of Kashmir professor, one indicator of climate change is the increasing frequency of climate extremes. A heat wave, he said, is a climate extreme and a direct indicator of climate change.

Scenes of flash floods on the north east and severe heatwave in Delhi emerged all throughout the weekend.

‚ÄúOver the last few decades, global warming has been on an accelerated pace and its marks can be seen in any single day of global weather since the 2000s. Generation Z has never lived a day without feeling the influence of global warming,"" added Roxy Mathew Koll from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology told PTI in Pune.

The national capital recorded its second hottest April this year since 1951 with a monthly average maximum temperature of 40.2 degrees Celsius. Other north Indian states, including the hill areas of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, also recorded temperatures way above the normal level this season.

While north India battled high temperatures, parts of Kerala and Lakshadweep islands saw heavy rainfall on Sunday. Besides, the weather office sounded a red alert across five districts in Kerala. And in the east, Assam‚Äôs Dima Hasao district has been hit by flash floods and massive landslides at several places, snapping rail and road links.

According to Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) data, the average maximum temperature over northwest and central India for April this year has been the highest in 122 years.

A 4.5 to 6.4-degree departure from normal is considered to declare a heat wave and over 6.4-degree departure for a severe heat wave.

Regardless of local weather interactions, Koll explained to PTI in an interview, the root cause for increase in such events in the India-Pakistan region is global warming due to human-made carbon emissions.

The Earth‚Äôs average temperature has increased by 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, said global climate change expert Harjeet Singh.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report released in 2021 warned that rising temperatures will lead to increased incidence of heat waves, longer warm seasons and shorter cold seasons, Singh, senior advisor, Climate Action Network-International (CAN-I), told PTI over phone.

Climate change effect on urban landscape

The impact of climate change is amplified in cities, since urban areas are usually warmer than their surroundings due to concentrated structures and less greenery.

In Romshoo‚Äôs view, heat waves, which are predicted to be more frequent, deadly and longer in the country, will affect every sector of the economy.

‚ÄúLook at the severity of the heat wave this year, it is concentrated in both Indus and Ganges river basins which produce and supply much of the food supplies in Pakistan and India. Heat waves are also projected to enhance the melting of glaciers in the region which is already facing water scarcity.""

The scientists said if the frequency of heat waves continues as is predicted, these will adversely impact food, water and energy security in the region.

As the globe hurtles towards climate disaster, what is the way out?

Romshoo said the impact on cryosphere (snow and glaciers) and the predicted increase of hydro-meteorological disasters are worrisome.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ these need to be addressed sector-wise through development of robust and judicious strategies and policies based on scientific inputs and guided by knowledge.""

Weather conditions in Delhi

People in Delhi woke up to a partly cloudy sky on Monday morning with the meteorological department forecasting a thunderstorm or dust storm in the national capital that could bring down the mercury by a few notches thereby providing temporary relief from the sweltering heat.

The MeT department said a cyclonic circulation over Punjab and Haryana will induce pre-monsoon activity that will provide some relief from the intense heat on Monday and Tuesday.

The IMD said a thunderstorm or a dust storm is likely in the national capital on Monday.

The minimum temperature on Monday morning was recorded at 30.8 degrees Celsius, four notches above normal. The relative humidity was at 22 per cent.

The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 41 degrees Celsius.

Flash floods in Assam

Around 57,000 people across seven districts of Assam have been affected by the current spell of flood in the northeastern state, according to an official statement.

The data also shows that nearly 222 villages under 15 revenue circles are affected in this wave of flood and around 10321.44 hectares of cultivated land has submerged under flood waters. Three people including a child died during this natural calamity in Assam.

Apart from human beings, the flood has also affected 1,434 animals and a total of 202 houses have been damaged so far.

The river had breached the danger mark of 205.33 metres on Friday following heavy rains in the upper catchment areas, prompting authorities to evacuate around 7,000 people from low-lying areas. The water level had receded below the warning mark on Monday and stood at 203.96 metres at 6 pm on Tuesday.

However, the water level rose again and crossed the warning mark around midnight. It stood at 204.89 metres at 7 am on Wednesday, the Delhi government's flood control room said.

A forecast issued by the Central Water Commission said the river is likely to rise to 205.25 metres by 9 pm and remain stable thereafter. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said widespread rainfall ""with isolated heavy falls"" is very likely over Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand over the next two-three days.

The catchment of the Yamuna river system covers parts of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. Last week, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed to people to avoid going towards the banks of the river.

Flood alert

A flood alert is declared in Delhi when the discharge rate from the Hathnikund barrage in Haryana's Yamuna Nagar crosses the one lakh-cusecs mark and people living near the floodplains and in flood-prone areas are evacuated. The Yamuna floodplains and low-lying areas in Delhi near the river are considered vulnerable to flooding. They are home to around 37,000 people.

The overflowing Yamuna had affected low-lying areas near the river in northeast, east and southeast Delhi last week and around 7,000 people were shifted to higher ground. The Delhi flood control room reported a discharge rate of around 14,000 cusecs from the Hathnikund Barrage in Haryana's Yamuna Nagar at 6 am on Wednesday. It was 19,745 cusecs at 7 pm on Tuesday.

The discharge rate was 2.21 lakh cusecs at 3 pm on Thursday, the highest so far this year. One cusec is equivalent to 28.32 litres per second. Normally, the flow rate at the Hathnikund barrage is 352 cusecs, but the discharge increases after heavy rainfall in the catchment areas. The water discharged from the barrage normally takes two to three days to reach the national capital.

Last year, the Yamuna river breached the danger mark on July 30 and the water level at the Old Railway Bridge rose to 205.59 metres. In 2019, the flow rate peaked at 8.28 lakh cusecs on August 18-19, and the water level of the Yamuna touched 206.60 metres. In 1978, the river swelled to a record level of 207.49 metres.

According to RS Mittal, superintendent engineer, irrigation and water resources department, Yamunanagar, this is the highest water flow from the barrage of this monsoon season as the discharge increased after heavy rainfall in the catchment areas. One cusec is equivalent to 28.32 litres of water per second.

As per figures, the water levels started receding early morning after the discharge and was recorded at 2,13,908 cusecs at 1pm, 2,04,410 cusecs at 2 pm and 1,95,906 cusecs at 4 pm.

Following the discharge, the water is likely to enter low-lying areas of Karnal, Panipat, Sonipat and other districts of Haryana. Moreover, it takes 48 to 72 hours for the water flow to reach Delhi.

Mittal said that earlier, the water flow had been recorded at 2,21,786 cusecs on August 11 this year at the barrage.

On being asked about water entering villages in Yamunanagar district, he said, ‚ÄúAfter rise in the water flow, it is likely that water must have entered in local villages, but we are keeping a strict vigil. The water level will gradually decrease and if it won‚Äôt, we will install pump sets to do so.‚Äù

Ambala-Saharanpur rail line damaged

After the discharge, Yamuna reportedly swelled near Haryana-Uttar Pradesh border and damaged a portion of soil under the Ambala-Saharanpur rail line, following which railway officials from Ambala division rushed to the spot.

The railway operations were shut due to the incident, affecting nearly 20 trains on the route, Hari Mohan, Senior Divisional Commercial Manager (Sr.DCM), Ambala, said.

‚ÄúMany trains bound for Ambala or beyond were diverted via Panipat. The number of trains affected will gradually reduce as we will try to run them through the original route after the restoration work completes which is carried out at full pace by teams from Saharanpur and Ambala,‚Äù he added.

Delhi-NCR rain updates : Massive traffic jams were witnessed in Delhi and adjoining cities as the first monsoon rains lashed the national capital on Thursday (June 30), thus bringing much-needed respite from the scorching heat.

Multiple flights and trains have been delayed due to rain in Delhi-NCR. The delayed flights were diverted to Amritsar and Jaipur.

Several parts of Delhi like ITO, Barapullah, Ring Road and the capital borders, specially Delhi-Noida border, Chilla Border, UP Gate, Delhi-Gurugram road experienced heavy traffic as rains lashed the national capital.

Waterlogging was reported near Pragati Maidan, Delhi-Meerut Expressway near Vinod Nagar, Pul Prahaladpur underpass, IP Estate in front of WHO building, under Zakhira flyover, Jahangirpuri Metro station, Loni Road roundabout and Azadpur market underpass.

The national capital experienced severe waterlogging and traffic jams after a sudden burst of heavy rainfall in several parts of Delhi-NCR.

Earlier this month, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had said the Delhi government is ready to combat waterlogging on a war footing and it is focussing on solving the problem with micro-planning.

The Public Works Department (PWD) has set up a Central Control Room from where 10 critical waterlogging sites in Delhi are being monitored 24√ó7 through CCTV cameras.

Mumbai won‚Äôt forget the 2005 flood anytime soon, as over 1,000 people had lost their lives. Nearly two decades later, the ‚ÄòMaximum City‚Äô still comes to a grinding halt when it rains. Earlier this month parts of the city were inundated in waist-deep water.

And it is not just India's financial capital. Majority of urban areas lack effective storm water drainage. Add to that unplanned development, encroachment of natural drainage corridors, and climate change and it becomes a perfect storm.

And the economic impact of flooding is also damaging. Mumbai lost Rs 14,000 crore to floods due to heavy rainfall between 2005 and 2015. The Brihanmumbai StormWater Disposal System, or BRIMSTOWAD, project to overhaul the city‚Äôs old storm water drainage system was proposed after the 1985 floods. However, work finally started after the 2005 deluge.

The project, which included building eight major pumping stations, was yet to be completed as of January this year. Till that point, only six pumping stations had been built. The Brimstowad project was to cost Rs 616.30 crore when it was proposed in 1991. It was meant to be completed in 12 years. As of April 2021, Rs 2,439.35 crore had been spent on it and an additional investment of Rs 2,700 crore was still needed.

Let us move on to the national capital. Delhi‚Äôs first Drainage Master Plan was prepared in 1976. Even in 2022, the capital is still operating on the same plan. The Delhi government has been trying to put in place a new plan for years now. In December last year, the state government decided to engage consultants to solve the problem after finding that the plan prepared by IIT Delhi had no actionable points.

The Public Works Department was supposed to start the tendering process for consultants by January and have them engaged by March. However, as of July this year, there was no indication that a consultancy had been appointed. Even if the PWD had stuck to its original time frame, a national daily had said that the drainage master plan would be prepared only by March 2023. Delhi's drainage system would be redeveloped by 2025.

In October last year, a Comptroller and Auditor General report had highlighted that the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, or BBMP, had not removed 714 encroachments out of the 2,626 identified near water bodies. Of the 23 significant encroachments, 16 were not even on BBMP‚Äôs list.

Also, the IT capital‚Äôs storm water drains were not directly connected to its water bodies. In some places, the runoff water was flowing into constructed deviation canals. CAG found that this increased the chances of flash floods.

Storm drains in many Indian cities were designed for a rainfall intensity of 12‚Äì20 mm per hour, which is insufficient for the current rainfall standards. They will have to be replaced or retrofitted. This will require funding.

Managing water logging falls to the states and UTs and is one of the functions of their urban local bodies. An RBI analysis of 2017-18 data of 221 municipal bodies across India found that nearly half the bodies were under high fiscal stress, given their limited ability to raise own revenues.

Another recent central bank study found that 70 per cent of surveyed urban local bodies had seen a worsening in revenues and an increase in expenditure during the pandemic. Thus, there is a question mark on how quickly India can build up its urban stormwater infrastructure.

But some progress has been made. Till April this year, under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, states and Union Territories had taken up 799 projects worth 2,952 crore rupees for the elimination of 3,770 water-logging points. And out of that, April, 633 projects worth 1,180 crore rupees had been completed, which had resulted in the elimination of 2,300 water-logging points.

A June 2020 Ministry of Earth Sciences climate change assessment report had noted how the increased frequencies of heavy rainfall had enhanced flood risk all over India, particularly in urban areas. This requires an urgent fix. Also the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs should start maintaining data on economic loss and deaths due to waterlogging to help us assess the overall damage.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

According to the IMD, Delhi is expected to receive moderate rain during the upcoming week.

Meanwhile, a video was shared by some users on social media that purportedly showed the unendurable condition of Delhi roads following the recent showers. In the video, civilians are seen wading through hip-deep water while a few others push a stuck SUV.

""Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, Swimming Pool Scheme. This Delhi, how beautiful are the roads here. The system here is wonderful, the government here,"" a Twitter handle wrote sarcastically while sharing the video.

The archived version of the claim made by a verified account can be seen here.

The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim is misleading. This video was not shot in Delhi but in Haryana's Rohtak in June 2022.

AFWA Probe

All available reports stated an overcast sky and moderate rainfall in the Capital since Thursday. There were no reports of flooding of such intensity anywhere in the capital city.

We checked the frames of the video for clues next. A close look partially revealed the initial letter of the vehicle being pushed by a few men in the video. It was 'H' and not 'DL'.

Towards the end of the 32-second video, a name board over one of the closed stores also becomes visible. It read 'Chopra Electricals'.

Combining the two available clues, we ran a Google search for establishments named 'Chopra Electricals' in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. The top result was a store in the Rohtak district of Haryana.

Using Google Maps, we looked for matches for the video from Rohtak's Huda Complex where the shop is located.

At the beginning of the video, the number ""P-25"" was visible on one of the pillars of the overbridge as a young lady passes by. The same number was spotted on a beam near the electrical shop on Google Maps as well.

A Jio outlet was visible adjacent to the electrical store in the video. The Google Map of the locality confirmed the shop immediately next to Chopra Electricals is indeed a Jio Digital Life store. The hoardings of both the stalls in the video were available here as well.

We were also able to match other beams and vertical plant lines below the flyover visible in the video with images of Huda Complex on Google Maps.

With the location confirmed, we contacted Asish Chopra, the proprietor of Chopra Electricals next to assert if the deluge was recent or otherwise. Asish told India Today the video was from June 30, 2022, and accused the local administration of not running the drainage pump properly -- resulting in a flood-like situation despite no excess rainfall in the area so far.

Further investigation revealed the AAP's Haryana unit had released a video from the same neighbourhood from the eventful day on their Twitter page.

""In Rohtak, Haryana, the whole city was submerged in a boat-like situation,"" the Hindi caption of the tweet from July 1 read. They further accused the state government of being corrupt in the video.

Thus, it is clear that the video of flooded roads shared as being from Delhi is originally from Haryana's Rohtak.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
delhi,2022,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/10/many-dead-as-late-monsoon-rains-bring-more-misery-to-north-india,10-Oct-22,At least 18 dead as late monsoon causes havoc across north India,"At least 18 dead in the past 24 hours as an unusually late rainy season brings more misery across the country.

Incessant rain has lashed parts of northern India, forcing schools to close in several cities as an unusually late rainy season prolonged havoc across the country and killed at least 18 people over the past 24 hours.

The state-run Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday said heavy rainfall was expected for the northern states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and parts of Rajasthan until Tuesday.

The rainy season usually draws to a close in northwest India from mid-September, and it should be ending across the country by mid-October.

Some environmentalists suspect climate change is behind the unusually wet weather.

Parts of northwest India got 1,293 percent more rainfall than normal on Sunday, with Uttar Pradesh receiving as much as 22.5mm, the IMD said.

Eighteen people were killed in various accidents attributed to the rain over the past 24 hours in the state, including drownings and electrocutions, authorities said.

Three people were killed when a building collapsed in the capital, New Delhi, as heavy rain drenched the city on Sunday, Indian news agency ANI reported. It was not immediately clear if rain caused the collapse.

One benefit of rain has been cleaner air.

Delhi‚Äôs air improved significantly because of the weekend downpours with the quality index at 36, in the ‚Äúgood‚Äù category, early on Monday, according to the US embassy‚Äôs air pollution monitor.

Incessant rain and floods have been a bane for big Indian cities in the past month, including the tech hub Bengaluru in southern India and the business district of Gurugram near New Delhi.

Crops damaged before harvest

The heavy rainfall has also damaged key summer-sown crops such as rice, soybean, cotton, pulses and vegetables just before harvesting, which could stoke food inflation in Asia‚Äôs third biggest economy, farmers, traders and industry officials said.

Higher food prices could prompt New Delhi to slap additional restrictions on exports of food commodities such as rice, wheat, and sugar, and potentially force the Reserve Bank of India to raise key interest rates again.

‚ÄúThere has been so much rainfall from the last one week that now we can see sprouts from the paddy seeds,‚Äù said Narendra Shukla, a 36-year-old farmer from Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh.

The entire paddy crop, which could have been harvested in two weeks, has flattened and Shukla is now waiting for the weather to clear so he can finish the task and plant potatoes.

Uttar Pradesh, the country‚Äôs second biggest producer of rice, has received 500 percent more rainfall than normal so far in October.

Crop damage could lead to a reduction in yields and a deterioration in harvest quality since crops were ready for gathering and in some places harvested crops were already drying, said Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India Pvt Ltd, which trades farm goods.

Indian farmers usually plant summer-sown crops in June-July with the arrival of monsoon rains, with harvesting starting from mid-September.

But this year the cycle was delayed by lower rainfall in June and while crops are now ready for harvesting, an area of low pressure is bringing heavy rainfall in northwestern and eastern parts of the country and delaying the end of the southwest monsoon.

Northern and eastern areas are expected to see heavy rainfall in the first half of this week, while southern India could get above average precipitation in the second half, said a senior IMD official.

Crop damage is likely to push already rising food prices up further, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm.

‚ÄúThe government and the RBI are under pressure to bring down inflation. The downward revision in crop production numbers means more and prolonged export curbs,‚Äù the dealer said.

The RBI has already raised its benchmark repo rate by 190 basis points this year.

Neighbouring Pakistan has also been hit by unprecedented flooding and the government there blames climate change for unusually heavy rain and for accelerating the melting of Himalayan glaciers.

Heavy rain over the past five days has triggered landslides and flash floods across Nepal, stranding dozens of foreign hikers and climbers in several places, authorities there said.

The incessant rain September 22, 2022 that has brought the entire Delhi-National Capital Region to a standstill was caused by the interaction between three different weather systems, enhanced further by the ongoing La Ni√±a phenomenon and a warming Arctic region.

The retreating monsoon winds, a low-pressure area over northwest Madhya Pradesh and a western disturbance are acting together over northwest India to bring the torrential rains, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

Skymet Weather services, a private weather forecasting company based in Noida, predicted that the low pressure area, blocked by the monsoon winds and the western disturbance, may remain situated over northwest Madhya Pradesh and southwest Uttar Pradesh for the next two days, inducing more rainfall.

The rains have led to flooding in many areas, especially Gurugram, where schools have shut down and offices have asked employees to work from home.

The flooding and water logging in the cities is not just because of the rains. It is also due to the lopsided infrastructure development which gives no way for the water to be drained out.

The rains though have played their part and brought down the temperature of the capital city several notches below normal at 28 degrees Celsius September 22, according to IMD.

Delhi received 46.2 millimetres (mm) of rainfall between the morning of September 22 and the morning of September 23. This is more than 10 times its normal rainfall of 4.1 mm, according to data from the IMD.

In terms of absolute rainfall, the districts of South Delhi and East Delhi fared the worst, with 106.2 mm and 75 mm rains respectively. In terms of percentage, South West Delhi fared the worst, with 2,044 per cent excess rains.

But the rainfall did not just affect Delhi. Gurugram, from where the visuals and videos of water logging and stranded travellers went viral on social media websites, received 92.6 mm of rainfall which is a whopping excess of 2,887 per cent, highest in the state of Haryana.

In absolute terms, Faridabad received the maximum rainfall of 110.7 mm, an almost 2,000 percent excess. Overall, Haryana received 739 per cent excess rainfall between September 22 and September 23. Four other districts received excess rainfall greater than 1,000 per cent.

Western Uttar Pradesh received 696 per cent excess rains, with 13 districts receiving excess rainfall of greater than 1,000 percent. The highest absolute rainfall of 97.3 mm occurred in Etah district, which was an excess of 5,625 per cent.

Eastern Rajasthan received 453 per cent excess rains, with 11 districts receiving excess rainfall of greater than 500 per cent. Alwar (1,089 per cent) and Baran (976 per cent) districts were the worst-affected.

On September 23, IMD updated its prediction. It said a fresh western disturbance is also acting a little west of Rajasthan and the cyclonic circulation in the upper atmosphere associated with the low-pressure area remains.

Though there is also a trough from this cyclonic circulation towards the east up to the Bay of Bengal. This could bring rains to eastern Uttar Pradesh as well.

Normally, low-pressure systems that originate over the seas or oceans do not carry so much moisture so far inland. But that is now changing.

This had in turn made them interact with other weather systems, mainly western disturbances bringing moisture from the Mediterranean region and cause catastrophic rainfall, cloudbursts and subsequent floods, flash floods and landslides causing loss of life and property.

‚ÄúThe warming over the northern Arabian Sea and the northward shift of the southwesterly winds which produce less rain over Kerala and more rain over northern Maharashtra and Gujarat, have also allowed the low-pressure systems to travel inward towards the northwest,‚Äù Raghu Murtugudde, a climate scientist at the University of Maryland in the United States and Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, said.

This northward shift of the south-westerly winds and the warming of the northern Arabian Sea are both direct consequences of global warming.

Murtugudde also contends that ‚ÄúLa Ni√±a is also playing a role now and some indication is there that the warm Arctic has added an upper level forcing to reinforce the rains.‚Äù

He had predicted back in July that such heavy rainfall would happen towards the fag end of the monsoon season and this may continue till the monsoon withdraws completely from the Indian subcontinent.

‚ÄúI had commented back in July that I expect some fireworks in September because of the La Ni√±a and the Arctic warming. They seem to be playing out now,‚Äù Murtugudde said.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The estimates of losses are important because so-called Loss and Damage funding is on the agenda at COP 27 -- the first time it has been on the agenda of a climate conference.

Flooding caused the highest economic losses in China ($ 18.4 billion), followed by India ($ 3.2 billion), and Thailand ($ 0.6 billion).

Storms also caused significant economic damage, especially in India ($ 4.4 billion), China ($ 3.0 billion), and Japan ($ 2 billion).

The report highlightedhow the climate crisis is exacerbating food insecurity and poverty.

The Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) Asia-Pacific Disaster Reports 2021 and 2022, referred by WMO in its report, estimate that in Asia, the annual investment in adaptation would need to be highest for China, at $ 188.8 billion, followed by India at $ 46.3 billion, and Japan at $ 26.5 billion. As a percentage of the country‚Äôs GDP, the highest cost is estimated for Nepal, at 1.9%, followed by Cambodia at 1.8%, and India at 1.7%.

Many glaciers in High Mountain Asia including the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau lost mass rapidly due exceptionally warm and dry conditions in 2021, the report said. ‚ÄúThese so-called water towers of the world are vital for freshwater supplies for the most densely populated part of the planet and so glacier retreat has major implications for future generations. Water-related extremes are the most important hazard in Asia.‚Äù .

During 2020-2021, preliminary data available from glaciers observed in High-Mountain Asia show a clear regional heterogeneity in mass changes. Most glaciers in the High-Mountain Asia region, particularly in the south-eastern Tibetan Plateau, eastern Himalayas and Pamir Alai, suffered intense mass losses as the result of exceptionally warm and dry conditions in 2021, the report said . The glaciological year 2020/2021 is one of the two strongest years of ablation on observation record, close to 2009, it added.

In 2021, the largest relative precipitation deficit was observed in West Asia, including, in particular, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Arabian Peninsula. The largest absolute precipitation excesses, with reference to the 1981‚Äì2010 climate normal, were observed along the west coasts of India and Myanmar, in the eastern Himalayas and on the North China Plain. Abnormally high annual precipitation totals were also recorded in South and South-East Asia, eastern China and the West Siberian Plain.

‚ÄúThe climate indicators and extreme events shown this report and expected increase in precipitation over much of Asia in the future shows just how vital it is to strengthen early warning systems,‚Äù said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas in a statement.

The report, which was produced jointly with the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), was presented during the UN climate change negotiations, COP27, in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs critical that COP27 should deliver a strong provision on Loss and Damage funding. It is reparations for damages and will establish the polluters pays principle, which will be deterrence over large polluters,‚Äù said Sunita Narain, director general, Centre for Science and Environment.

Last year, there were a total of more than 100 natural hazard events in Asia, of which 80% were flood and storm events. These resulted in almost 4,000 fatalities, about 80%caused by flooding. Overall, 48.3 million people were directly affected by these hazards, causing total economic damage of US$ 35.6 billion.

During the formal opening of UN Climate Conference (COP27)‚Äôs Climate Implementation Summit last Monday, UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres said the world is on a highway to climate hell as global mean temperature is approaching the 1.5 degree C warming threshold.

‚ÄúGlobal temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible. We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot on the accelerator.

Nine more people, including two children, died in rain-related incidents in Assam, raising the toll in this year‚Äôs floods and landslides to 55, a bulletin by the state‚Äôs disaster management authority said. As many as 19 lakh people remained affected by the deluge in 28 districts of the state.

The deaths were reported from Hojai, Nalbari, Bajali, Dhubri, Kamrup, Kokrajhar, and Sonitpur districts. The landslides were reported in Dima Hasao, Goalpara, Hojai, Kamrup and Kamrup (Metropolitan) and Morigaon.

On Friday night, a boat carrying flood-affected people capsized in Hojai district, leaving three children missing while 21 others have been rescued.

A group of 24 villagers were moving to safety from inundated Islampur village late on Friday night when the boat hit submerged a brick kiln and capsized in Raikota area.

Meanwhile, a bulletin issued by the Central Water Commission (CWC) on June 18, Saturday said that Kopili River is flowing above ‚Äúhigh flood level‚Äù at Kampur in Nagaon district.

Other rivers including Brahmaputra, Jia-Bharali, Puthimari, Manas, Beki, Barak and Kushiara were flowing above the danger level, the bulletin said.

A total of 2,930 villages have been affected by the floods, with 43,338 hectares of cropland under water and 410 animals getting washed away.

According to PTI, Guwahati has been severely affected by continued waterlogging in most parts of the city, with areas such as Anil Nagar, Nabin Nagar, Zoo Road, Six Mile, Noonmati, Bhootnath, Maligaon, Bamunimaidam, Rajgarh Link Road, Hatigaon, Rukimingaon, Fatasil and Gotanagar remaining severely affected.

At least 234 roads and 16 bridges have been damaged in the rain, officials said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday, June 18 called up chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and inquired about the flood situation, while also assuring the chief minister of all possible help from the Centre.

The situation is no better in Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh, where roads have been damaged due to landslides and villages are largely flooded.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials, Mawsynram and Sohra in Meghalaya‚Äôs East Khasi Hills district are in a competition to be the wettest place in the country recording record rainfall in the last 24 hours ending 8:30 am on June 17.

While Sohra (erstwhile Cherrapunji) in Meghalaya recorded a massive 972 mm of rainfall on June 17, Mawsynram received 1003.6 mm showers during the same period.

At least 18 people have died over the past two days in Meghalaya in flash floods and landslides, officials stated.

In neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh, water from river Subansiri has submerged the under-construction dam site of a hydroelectric power project. Workers employed at the dam site have been asked to move to safety by authorities of National Hydro Power Corporation, which is developing the project, official sources told PTI.

Torrential rain in the frontier state has inundated numerous villages of the two districts of Dhemaji and Lakhimpur, a government official told the news agency.

More than 2,000 people have been displaced due to flooding in Sadar subdivision of West Tripura district triggered by torrential rain, officials said on Saturday, June 18.

They have taken shelter in 20 relief camps. However, no fatality has been reported so far, they said.

West Tripura district has received 155 mm of rainfall in the last 24 hours, causing inundation of several low-lying areas on the banks of Howrah River.

NEW DELHI ‚Äî At least 40 people have died and others are missing in flash floods triggered by intense monsoon rains in northern India over the past three days, officials said Sunday.

The rains inundated hundreds of villages, swept away mud houses, flooded roads and destroyed bridges in some parts of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand states. The Indian Meteorological Department predicted that heavy to very heavy rain would continue to fall in the region for the next two days.

An official government release Sunday said landslides and flooding in the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh over the last three days killed at least 36 people. Hundreds were taking shelter in relief camps after being displaced from their flooded homes.

In the neighboring state of Uttarakhand, a series of cloudbursts Saturday left four dead and 13 went missing as rivers breached banks and washed away some houses.

Rescue teams were evacuating the stranded in both states.

Disasters caused by landslides and floods are common in India's Himalayan north during the June-September monsoon season. Scientists say they are becoming more frequent as global warming contributes to the melting of glaciers there.

We are officially in the last leg of the southwest monsoon, with the monsoon trough gradually retreating from Rajasthan, Gujarat and other northwesternmost Indian territories. But as is evidenced by the torrential rains that lashed the northwestern plains last week, the monsoon looks determined to stir up as much trouble as possible before its inevitable departure.

In many flood-prone locations across the country, heavy downpours have resulted in rainwater inundating the streets and homes on several occasions. And while traffic congestion and power outages were the more immediate effects of the stagnated water, there are other relatively long-term effects such flooding episodes can have on people: monsoon diseases.

The filthy water that collects in the potholes generously strewn across our roads and other stagnant bodies of rainwater act as the perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes carrying vectors causing dengue and malaria. And this is why India and its neighbours usually see an uptick in these diseases during the monsoons.

Pakistan, which had already been battling deadly floods triggered by heavy rains since mid-June, has been dealing with an unchecked spread of dengue. Between September 25 and 26, about 419 new cases were reported across Sindh, with the majority registered in the provincial capital Karachi, Xinhua news agency said. And these recent cases have increased this year's overall caseload in Sindh to 7,951.

Now, certain cities in India have also become victims of the viral disease.

A worker sprays insecticides in residential areas (IANS)

The situation in West Bengal seems to be the most dire, with the state health department reporting 840 new infections on Monday. Over 500 people have been hospitalised, and two fatalities were reported in Kolkata on the day.

The positivity rate has climbed from 10% to 12% in the last ten days. And most of the cases have been reported from North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Howrah, Kolkata, Hooghly, Murshidabad, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling districts.

Advertisement Uttar Pradesh hasn't been able to escape the mosquito-borne disease either. At least 12 people in Lucknow tested positive for dengue over the weekend, and several more await the test results.

Prof Kauser Usman, senior faculty at King George's Medical University, said: ""The next ten days are crucial as far as dengue is concerned, as cases may rise considerably.""

Dengue infections in Delhi increased significantly on Monday, too, bringing the seven-day total of positive cases to 129. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi's data shows that 525 cases have been reported so far this monsoon season, which is the highest in the last four years. Hospitals have been asked to remain vigilant and be prepared to treat dengue patients by government officials.

Since prevention is always better than cure, mosquito repellants are recommended during the monsoon months. Avoiding leaving pools of stagnant water uncovered and wearing clothes that cover your arms and legs can also help us avoid pesky insects.

Still, if you experience high fever, severe headaches, vomiting, nausea, and muscle and joint aches, you must seek medical attention immediately. A healthy person's body typically possesses 1.5 lakh to 4 lakh platelets, and when someone contracts dengue, their platelet count could drop below 50,000. This could lead to significant risks, which is why it is essential to take your symptoms seriously.

Deterioration of ties

The statement by the Prime Minister last month came as a surprise to many, given the steady deterioration of India‚Äôs relationship with Pakistan over the last eight years since Modi came to power.

Modi had famously begun his tenure with an invitation to Pakistan‚Äôs then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for the swearing-in ceremony in May 2014. Sharif had come to India, along with the leaders of other SAARC nations.

Modi‚Äôs gesture, and the meeting between the two Prime Ministers had held the promise of a new beginning for the bilateral relationship that had suffered a severe setback after the 26/11 terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2008.

Read in Explained | How the monster flood in Pakistan is different from what India is experiencing

However, a string of incidents that followed ‚Äî India‚Äôs red line on the meeting between Pakistan‚Äôs diplomats and leaders of the separatist Hurriyat, the terrorist attacks in Pathankot and Uri ‚Äî impacted the relationship negatively, and New Delhi made it clear that ‚Äútalks and terror can‚Äôt go together‚Äù.

Ties have been hit further over the last few years, especially after the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019, and the abrogation of Article 370, which revoked the special status to Jammu and Kashmir, in August that year. That led to the downsizing of the High Commissions in both capitals; there are no full-time High Commissioners in either country now. The constitutional changes in J&K, and Pakistan‚Äôs response to them, took bilateral ties to a new low ‚Äî and the subsequent controversy involving diplomats of both countries in 2020 have not helped the ties.

Change of PM in Pak

After the ouster of Imran Khan, and the coming to power of the new coalition government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, some positive noises have emanated from Islamabad.

In April this year, hours after Prime Minister Sharif asked Modi to come forward to address the Kashmir issue so that the two countries could concentrate on tackling poverty and unemployment, the Indian Prime Minister congratulated the new leader of Pakistan, and said that India desired peace and stability in a region free of terrorism.

In a letter written to Modi, Sharif said Pakistan remained committed to ‚Äúregional peace and security‚Äù, and sought ‚Äúpeaceful and cooperative‚Äù ties with India. Prime Minister Sharif, who is the younger brother of the three-time Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, also underlined in his letter that these peaceful and cooperative ties could be achieved through ‚Äúmeaningful dialogue‚Äù.

In his maiden address to the National Assembly as Prime Minister, Shehbaz, who was Chief Minister of Pakistan‚Äôs Punjab province when his brother, then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, visited India at Modi‚Äôs invitation in 2014, said: ‚ÄúWe want good ties with India but durable peace is not possible until the Kashmir dispute is resolved.‚Äù He attacked his predecessor, Imran Khan, for not making ‚Äúserious and diplomatic efforts‚Äù when India abrogated Article 370 in August 2019.

In New Delhi, officials read Sharif‚Äôs statement, and the exchange of greetings and missives within days of the swearing-in of the new Pakistan PM, as ‚Äúpositive‚Äù.

Responses to disasters

In the past, when natural disasters struck India and Pakistan, the two countries at times reached out to each other with offers of help.

Advertisement

For example, in January-February 2001, after the earthquake hit Bhuj in Gujarat, Pakistan had reached out with help, and had sent tents and blankets for the survivors. Then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had spoken to Pakistan‚Äôs military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, to formally thank him for sending aid. It was not a big consignment, senior diplomats recall, but the gesture was important. Vajpayee and Musharraf had a brief conversation, the first since the general had seized power in a coup 15 months previously.

In 2005, when a powerful earthquake struck both India and Pakistan, India sent aircraft with relief supplies to Pakistan and pledged $ 25 million through the United Nations to support Pakistan‚Äôs relief efforts.

In 2010, when a ‚Äúsuperflood‚Äù ‚Äî the worst in recent decades until the deluge of 2022 ‚Äî hit Pakistan, India offered $ 5 million in help, but Islamabad declined to accept it.

The case for help now

Though there has not been much follow-up activity, the Indian Prime Minister‚Äôs outreach by way of a message created a potential opening for ‚Äúdisaster diplomacy‚Äù.

That the ruling dispensation in Pakistan is well disposed towards a possible gesture of humanitarian support from India was indicated by Prime Minister Sharif, who tweeted: ‚ÄúI thank Indian PM Narendra Modi @narendramodi for condolences over the human & material losses caused by floods. With their characteristic resilience the people of Pakistan shall, InshaAllah, overcome the adverse effects of this natural calamity & rebuild their lives and communities.‚Äù

Pakistan‚Äôs Finance Minister Miftah Ismail has said that the government can consider importing vegetables and other edible items from India following the destruction of standing crops due to the floods. Prices of vegetables and fruit have gone through the roof as supplies from Balochistan, Sindh, and south Punjab especially, have been badly affected.

The two major partners in Pakistan‚Äôs ruling coalition, the PPP led by Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto, and the PML(N) led by the Sharifs, are waiting for further gestures from New Delhi. On the Pakistani side, Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa has earlier spoken in favour of improving ties. But the PTI under Imran Khan has been opposing reconciliatory moves, pushing the other political actors into a corner.

For the Indian government, the case for extending humanitarian help ties in well with its desire to project itself as the ‚Äúfirst responder‚Äù in times of disaster and crisis in the neighbourhood. Vaccine diplomacy and the efforts to brand India as the ‚Äúpharmacy to the world‚Äù have been billed as major achievements of the government. In recent months and years, India has extended its hand of help and cooperation to the Maldives, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan, and Afghanistan. Trucks filled with Indian grain have travelled to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan via Pakistan.

Pakistan‚Äôs establishment has discussed the possibility of getting food grains through international organisations, who want to send relief material from India. The help from India can be at the micro and short-term level: food, fuel, tents, medicines, and emergency essential supplies. At the macro and medium-to-long-term, it could involve help in the reconstruction of damaged homes and properties, and the archaeological site of Mohenjo Daro, part of the cultural heritage of both countries. India‚Äôs expertise in healthcare can be of help in the post-floods scenario ‚Äî dengue is already on the rise, and diseases such as typhoid are expected to spike sharply.

However, some in the Indian establishment believe that the government‚Äôs stated policy of ‚Äútalks and terror can‚Äôt go together‚Äù, and the extending of help to Pakistan are at odds with each other. For New Delhi, the decision is as much about projecting power as a global responder as with managing the ruling party‚Äôs domestic political base.",flood,2022 Pakistan floods,Pakistan,"June 14, 2022",Present,"Balochistan, Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa",Record-breaking rainfall,"1,355 people killed, 33 million people affected, massive shortages of wheat and fuel","1,355","33 million people affected, massive shortages of wheat and fuel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe
delhi,2022,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/behind-the-systemic-roots-of-urban-flooding-in-india-101662484178630.html,07-Sep-22,Number Theory: Behind the systemic roots of urban flooding in India,"Parts of Bengaluru, India‚Äôs IT and startup capital, have been facing unprecedented floods for the last two days. This is not the first instance of urban flooding in India. In fact, urban flooding is becoming increasingly common in many parts of the country with this monsoon season itself seeing many such instances in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Madhya Pradesh. Kerala, another southern state, has seen multiple instances of urban flooding in the past few years, and so has Gurugram, Delhi‚Äôs 21st century satellite.

The fact that such instances are spreading to more cities and happening with greater frequency, suggests that something is broken in our response to such events. An HT analysis shows that repeated and growing problems of urban floods is a systemic problem and the root cause of this is prioritising economic gains over everything else. Here are three charts which explain this in detail.

We don‚Äôt even know what is urban in India

The official source of rural-urban data in India is the decadal Census. While this works well for administrative purposes, the Census classification is of little use when it comes to understanding risks such as flooding. A lot of urban flooding such as the recent one in Bengaluru is a result of unregulated construction in regions such as wetlands and floodplains. Such urban expansion, which is often carried on in collusion with urban authorities, can continue to happen long after an area has been classified as urban in the Census. A comparison with the satellite data from the European Space Agency‚Äôs Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) is a good way to explain this. While the Census shows a 31% increase in urban area in India between 2001 and 2011, satellite data shows a 94% increase in urban areas during this period. To be sure, urban areas classified under the census is still larger than what the satellite reads as urban, but the latter is a better indicator or takeover of cultivated land, forests, grasslands or other vegetation, and water bodies.

A lot of urban flooding such as the recent one in Bengaluru is a result of unregulated construction in regions such as wetlands and floodplains.

In 2019, Patna faced massive urban floods in late September. One of the reasons the municipal authorities were unable to deal with the problem was that they could not even locate the drainage map of the city, which has a population of 5.8 million according to the 2011 Census. While Patna seems like a basket case here, most Indian cities do not look very good when it comes to their drainage capabilities. According to a 2010-11 report by the ministry of urban development, storm water drain coverage ‚Äì they are essential for draining away large discharge in a short time such as heavy rainfall ‚Äì was below 50% in 56 of the 104 cities which sent responses. Bengaluru, the city which is facing floods at the moment, had just 10% of its roads covered by storm water drains.

In 2019, Patna faced massive urban floods in late September.

Why does the state not take steps to plug these loopholes?

One can, of course, take recourse to lack of state capacity, regulatory capture, and other such terms. But there is another answer to this question. Any policy which prioritises environmental concerns over construction will have to deny permission for a lot of construction activity in India, especially in cities. This is bound to lead to economic losses for the those engaged in this sector, as well as increase the cost of housing for those who want to buy such houses.

This is not an easy decision to make, given the growing importance of the real estate sector in India. A comparison of Gross Value Added data from National Account Statistics (NAS) shows that the real estate, ownership of dwelling and professional services sub-sector has shown the highest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) among all subsectors of the economy between 2011-12 and 2020-21. Its share in GVA has increased from 13% to 17% during this period. There is another side to this story as well. The share of housing credit in total bank credit was just over 2% in the beginning of the 1990s in India. This increased to 13% by 2020-21.

While the growing commercial importance of real estate explains why unregulated urbanisation continues to take place in India, repeated urban floods in more cities are a grim warning that this unmitigated quest for capital gains will ultimately bring loss of both capital and lives.",issue,Bengaluru Floods 2022,"Bengaluru, India","July 16, 2022","July 18, 2022",Bengaluru city and surrounding areas,100 mm in 24 hours,"Damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses",10,"Major disruption to daily life, transportation, and businesses",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Ghaziabad : Five lakh cusecs of water was released from the Hathnikund barrage in Yamunanagar, Haryana and now its effect is being seen in the Yamuna Khadar area of Delhi and Ghaziabad. Khadar fields have been submerged in flood waters. At the same time, crocodiles have also come in with the water of this flood, reported Dainik Bhaskar.

These crocodiles are seen swimming in the Loni area of Ghaziabad. This has created panic among the villagers.

The Yamuna River is flowing from outside Pachaira village of Loni area in Ghaziabad after dam gates were opened. Villagers said that for the last two days many crocodiles are being seen in the water of the river. Some villagers have also made videos of these crocodiles.

In one such video, a giant crocodile is sitting on a mud island built in the stream of the Yamuna River. In another video, a crocodile is seen swimming in the river. Farmers are afraid to go towards the fields on the banks of Khadar.

Hathnikund Barrage is located in Yamunanagar of Haryana State. On August 11, the highest level of water in this rainy season was recorded at the barrage. Five days ago, about five lakh cusecs of water was diverted from this barrage into the Yamuna River.

Due to this, the water level of the Yamuna River has increased in some areas of Baghpat, Ghaziabad and Delhi in Uttar Pradesh. Several villages in the area are affected by the floods. The floodwater is also reportedly entering the fields of farmers, destroying crops.

Even as policymakers and people‚Äôs representatives are trying to understand the reason, three citizen researchers from Paani Earth Foundation who criss-crossed the region for several weeks attributed the mess to the altered hydrology of the completely concretised Koramangala-Challaghatta (KC) Valley.Analysis of data sourced from multiple government organisations revealed the region has lost a whopping 253 waterbodies. The study has, in fact, termed the lost waterbodies extinct! It has put the surviving waterbodies in the valley ‚Äî whose watershed area comprises 35.5% of BBMP‚Äôs geographical area ‚Äî at 150.The study says most lake extinction has happened upstream of Bellandur Lake on Koramangala and Challaghatta streams. ‚ÄúThe now impervious extinct lakebeds and streambeds, not to mention the concretised catchment, dramatically increase the speed of water flow. A considerable volume of water races through the concrete jungle towards Bellandur Lake and causes it to overflow, severely flooding the downstream communities,‚Äù explained Nirmala Gowda , a techie-turned-researcher part of the study.Mapping the changes in KC Valley, the researchers have published their findings on web platform Paani. Earth, which aims to empower citizens and decision-makers with evidence-based data on lakes. Another flood-related insight from the study pertains to Ulsoor Lake, says Madhuri Mandava , also a techie-turned-researcher part of the team. She said the 100-acre Ulsoor Lake and two other small lakes are the only non-extinct waterbodies in Challaghatta catchment area. Ulsoor Lake is the sole permeable waterbody, but unfortunately it is isolated from the interconnected lake system due to a deliberately engineered bypass, she said.The inlet that brings water to Ulsoor Lake is engineered to bypass it and connect directly with the stream downstream. Bypass around waterbodies is created to prevent non-biodegradable undiluted raw wastewater (industrial effluents, sewage and disintegrating solid waste), flowing all through the year in the concretised streambeds, from entering the lake and polluting it. Because of the bypass, the 100-acre lake can‚Äôt harness flood water. Incidentally, the findings are contrary to the narrative put forth by Karnataka State Pollution Control Board that the city‚Äôs waterbodies are polluted to a large extent due to untreated sewage entering them from residential units.Besides, Ulsoor Lake‚Äôs source of water is the sewage treatment plant located next to it. The lake is full of secondary treated wastewater all around the year; thus, there is just no space for flood water. ‚ÄúIt is a critical mass of these micro-level changes made over a period of time to the drastically altered urban hydrology that exacerbates urban floods in the watershed,‚Äù said Dr Nidhi Paliwal , a dentist-turned-researcher and team member.",issue,Bengaluru Floods,"Bengaluru, India",07-07-2022,10-07-2022,"['Koramangala', 'Challaghatta', 'Bellandur']","['100 mm, 150 mm, 200 mm']","['100 crores, 200 crores, 300 crores']","['10, 20, 30']","['Thousands of people were displaced from their homes.', 'Infrastructure was damaged.', 'The economy was disrupted.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs message, in a tweet on Monday evening, expressing condolences to the victims of the flooding in Pakistan, is a welcome gesture, especially after weeks of silence over what has been one of the worst natural disasters in the neighbourhood in recent times. More than 1,100 people have died, and over 33 million people have been affected, as officials say one-third of the country is under water, and estimate about $10 billion in damage to homes, roads and infrastructure. The floods have also affected standing crops, and as the waters recede, fears of disease as well as food shortages are expected to rise. In addition, the worry that the devastating floods have been caused due to climate change is a worry for all of South Asia, one of the world‚Äôs regions most vulnerable to global warming. On Tuesday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres launched a global appeal for aid to Pakistan, that he said had been hit by a ‚Äúmonsoon on steroids‚Äù, indicating unnatural climate patterns. Countries such as the U.K., the U.S., China, the UAE, Qatar and Turkey have already dispatched aid to Pakistan, and many others have promised help, while the IMF announced a $1.1 billion bailout tranche on Tuesday, as part of ongoing negotiations with the country that is already steeped in an economic crisis. Given that the crisis will only deepen at this point, Pakistan Finance Minister Miftah Ismail also said on Monday that he may propose lifting the trade ban imposed on India after the Jammu-Kashmir reorganisation in 2019, so as to import Indian vegetables and essential commodities. Thus far, Islamabad has only made exceptions for pharmaceutical imports from India during the COVID-19 pandemic, and India‚Äôs humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.

Despite the poor state of India-Pakistan ties, both New Delhi and Islamabad must put aside their domestic considerations, and seize the moment to help those stranded in the flooding as best they can. India cannot pride itself as being the ‚Äúfirst responder‚Äù in the neighbourhood ‚Äî as it has been for Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Afghanistan ‚Äî if it fails to see the suffering right at its land boundary with Pakistan. It would be churlish and short-sighted of Pakistan to reject an opportunity to lift the trade ban with India that has only hurt its own interests, and to give up a source of affordable supplies at a time of such calamity. And it would be both tragic and ridiculous if the enmity between the two countries would not allow them to work together at a time such as this, even as their governments allow their cricket teams to play each other for financial considerations. Significantly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif are due to travel to Uzbekistan in September for the SCO summit. While a more lasting dialogue, that has been suspended between the two countries for nearly a decade over the terrorism issue, is unlikely, the leaders must find the time to discuss ways to mitigate the catastrophe at hand.

On a cool afternoon in May, vehicles are lined up bumper to bumper as far as the eye can see on the Rishikesh-Kedarnath highway in Phata, a small town in Uttarakhand‚Äôs Rudraprayag district.

The convoy of vehicles is ferrying thousands of devotees who have descended on the hill State for the Char Dham Yatra ‚Äî an annual pilgrimage to four Hindu shrines: Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath ‚Äî which has resumed on a full scale this year after being a low-key affair for the last two years owing to COVID-19 restrictions.

The pilgrimage, considered one of the most sacred by the followers of Hinduism, is a journey to the abodes of four deities: Yamunotri (goddess Yamuna) and Gangotri (goddess Ganga) in Uttarkashi district; Kedarnath (Lord Shiva) in Rudraprayag district; and Badrinath (Lord Vishnu) in Chamoli district.

Nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas, the shrines are situated in the Garhwal region of the State, which is revered as ‚ÄòDev Bhumi‚Äô or the land of gods. All devout Hindus aspire to visit the four shrines at least once in their lifetime as they believe the yatra helps them attain ‚Äòmoksha‚Äô or salvation. They believe the arduous trek tests their faith and paves the way for an inward journey towards spiritual awakening.

‚ÄúGoing to Badrinath is like visiting Baikunth [the abode of Lord Vishnu]. All our wishes get fulfilled. Seeing Badrinath and Kedarnath gives strength to our body and mind. After COVID, I have learnt one lesson: there is no point in accumulating wealth. Everyone should fulfil their desires at the earliest,‚Äù says Sushma Dhabale, 52, who has arrived for the pilgrimage with her elderly parents from Nagpur in Maharashtra.

Seventy-four-year-old Subhash Chandra Patel, who is part of a group of 110 pilgrims from Satna in Madhya Pradesh, says, ‚ÄúUndertaking the yatra has been a family ritual since the time of my ancestors. We are here to rid ourselves of sins and seek blessings. Lord Shiva fulfils all our wishes,‚Äù he says.

A devotee attains peace of mind on completing the pilgrimage, says Pankaj Shukla, a priest at the Kedarnath temple. ‚ÄúThis journey cleanses the soul of a person and takes him towards higher consciousness. In this way, the soul is freed from the cycle of life and death.‚Äù

The pilgrimage also offers visitors panoramic views of the valley and the snow-capped mountains. Rishi Bhardwaj, 26, from Raipur in Chhattisgarh remarks that ‚Äúthere is no place like this in India... It is purely heaven‚Äù.

Ravindra Kumar, who runs Maruti Tour and Travels in Haridwar, says the pilgrimage draws people from all walks of life, but a large number of them are over 40 years and come from rural areas of the country. ‚ÄúThey are the real pilgrims with true devotion. Generally, pilgrims come in groups but we receive individual bookings too,‚Äù he says.

Of late, there has been a noticeable rise in the number of youth arriving for the pilgrimage. However, Ajendra Ajay, the president of the Badrinath-Kedarnath Temple Committee, has termed them tourists. ‚ÄúThey are not pilgrims. Religious fervour is mostly missing in the youth. We are seeing an influx of YouTubers and vloggers who come to boost their subscriber base and business interests. Usually, they don‚Äôt care about the sanctity of these holy places. Recently, a YouTuber visited Kedarnath with his dog and offended many pilgrims. We are trying to put a check on videography around the shrines.‚Äù

Heavy rush stalls traffic

Rishikesh is the starting point of the pilgrimage, which involves travel on foot and by pony, bus, car and helicopter across 1,200 km of hilly terrain. The train of pilgrims in Phata is heading to Gaurikund, where the 18-km trek to Kedarnath begins. However, the slow-moving traffic has halted their progress.

Traffic jams have become a common sight in the State since the opening of the doors of Gangotri and Yamunotri on May 3, and Kedarnath and Badrinath on May 6 and 8, respectively. The State administration is finding crowd management an uphill task amid complaints by pilgrims about overpriced amenities and inadequate medical facilities. The influx of pilgrims has also resulted in rising air pollution and growing piles of garbage that environmentalists say could hurt the State‚Äôs fragile ecology. However, tour operators and hoteliers are heaving a sigh of relief after reeling under losses during the pandemic.

Noticing the uptick in tourists, the State government on May 15 made registration for the pilgrimage mandatory and announced that pilgrims who fail to register themselves will not be allowed to proceed beyond Rishikesh.

Prabodh Kumar Ghildiyal, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Rudraprayag, says, ‚ÄúWe were forced to put a cap on the number of visitors. Pilgrims are facing many problems as they have made bookings for their stay and travel, but their registration slots are on different dates. So they are losing out on money. Seeing their faith and devotion, it is difficult to ask them to turn back,‚Äù he says.

According to government figures, 10.26 lakh pilgrims have visited the four shrines and over 21 lakh have registered for the Char Dham Yatra as of May 25. Kedarnath is the preferred destination of 6.97 lakh pilgrims followed by Badrinath (6.60 lakh), Gangotri (4.12 lakh) and Yamunotri (3.52 lakh).

‚ÄúIn 2019, the four shrines received over 32 lakh pilgrims before COVID-19 restrictions caused the numbers to drop to 3.21 lakh in 2020 and 5.09 lakh in 2021,‚Äù says Jaspal Chauhan, regional tourism officer, Dehradun.

Chaos at ticket counters

Chaos reigns at the inter-State bus terminal (ISBT) in Rishikesh with thousands of devotees desperate to visit Kedarnath. However, the Uttarakhand Transport Corporation is providing tickets only to Badrinath as slots for Kedarnath are booked till June 2.

Twenty-two-year-old Aman Rawat, who works at the registration centre at the ISBT, says, ‚ÄúSince there was no daily cap on visitors earlier, a large number of pilgrims have already reached the four shrines. Crowd management there is a challenge as the facilities in place are not sufficient to cater to this influx.‚Äù

Vinod, 28, a resident of Orchha in Madhya Pradesh who is undertaking the pilgrimage with his friend Shiv Pratap, says they completed their registration for Kedarnath on May 16 and Badrinath on May 19. ‚ÄúWe want to go to Kedarnath first, but we have received tickets only to Badrinath. Authorities are behaving rudely with us when we ask questions.‚Äù

Harshit Jain, 26, from Jalgaon in Maharashtra, wears a dejected look as he sits near the ticket window at the ISBT. ‚ÄúWe have been trying to visit Kedarnath for the past several years, but our plans were thwarted by COVID-19. We wanted to visit Badrinath and Kedarnath but no slot is available for Kedarnath.‚Äù

Unable to control the surge in pilgrims, the State administration on May 19 closed offline registration till May 27. Shailendra Singh Negi, Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Rishikesh and nodal officer for the yatra, says registration can be done using the Tourist Care Uttarakhand app. ‚ÄúPilgrims can register online and secure slots for their journey. We have vehicles to ferry pilgrims to their desired shrines. We are facilitating the accommodation of people stuck in Rishikesh at dharamshalas and schools.‚Äù

In Guptkashi, located 14 km away from Phata, a crowd of pilgrims has queued up amid heavy rain outside the Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam offline booking centre for helicopter services to Kedarnath. Despite waiting for over eight hours, Narendra Sawaliya, from Rajkot in Gujarat, and his family have not been able to lay their hands on a ticket. ‚ÄúThey get a list of VIPs every day and allot tickets to them. There are no tickets for common people,‚Äù he says.

Harish Shah, coordinator for helicopter services at Guptkashi, says only 260 seats are available and 180 of them are booked online. ‚ÄúSo that leaves only 80 seats for offline booking and out of them 20 to 25 are reserved under the VIP quota,‚Äù he explains.

Fillip for tourism industry

Hoteliers like Sandeep Negi, owner of Hotel New Ganga Putra in Sitapur, who saw hard times during the pandemic are happy to see the return of tourists. ‚ÄúThe huge footfall this year assures us of recovery of losses suffered over the past two years. Perhaps there will be no question of survival for us this season.‚Äù

Kishan Singh Panwar, who runs Char Dham hotel and restaurant in Tilwara, Rudraprayag, says he couldn‚Äôt pay the instalments on his loan but now sees some hope. Kuldeep Singh, owner of Mohini Hotel in Gaucher, Karnaprayag, says, ‚ÄúEverything seems perfect now. A major population of the State depends on the pilgrimage for livelihood.‚Äù

Mukesh Kumar, who offers pony rides at Sonprayag, says he had to work as a daily wage labourer during the pandemic. ‚ÄúThe money I earned was not enough to buy two meals a day. Without the Char Dham Yatra, people can‚Äôt survive in these hills.‚Äù Prashant Maithani, who runs the Voyage on Himalayas travel agency in Tapovan, Rishikesh, says, ‚ÄúWe are now fully booked till June-end.‚Äù

However, there is deep resentment among hoteliers in Sonprayag and Guptkashi as unregistered pilgrims cannot proceed beyond Rishikesh. Ramesh Chauhan, who runs Shree Krishna Palace hotel in Badkot, says, ‚ÄúWe have enough accommodation in the upper hills. How will we make earnings during this peak tourist season if the government stops people at Rishikesh?‚Äù

Paying a heavy price

Sushma Dhabale, who arrived from Maharashtra with her elderly parents, planned to visit Kedarnath on May 15, but received the slot for a later date. She is unhappy about having to wait out the remaining days in Rishikesh, where food and accommodation are overpriced. ‚ÄúThe money saved up for the yatra is being spent here,‚Äù she says.

Brijesh Sati, spokesperson of the Char Dham Teerth Purohit Hak Hakookdhari Mahapanchayat, a body representing priests, expressed his displeasure at devotees being overcharged for basic services. ‚ÄúThe government has failed to manage crowds. It is also difficult to make digital transactions due to poor network connectivity in the area.‚Äù

At Yamunotri, a prepaid counter for pony rides was opened after several tourists complained of being overcharged by private operators.

Ankit Gairola, 36, president of the market association in Sonprayag, says the administration is not making sufficient arrangements in the area. ‚ÄúThere is shortage of electricity and water, and people are defecating in the open as there are no toilets. Due to poor telecom signals, pilgrims are unable to contact their agents and seek help from the State administration. There is only one hospital in Sonprayag and the facilities are so inadequate that doctors are forced to sleep on the ground,‚Äù he says.

Manoj Rawat, a Congress leader and former MLA from Kedarnath, has accused the government of ruining the yatra‚Äôs reputation. ‚ÄúNo BJP Minister has travelled on foot to Kedarnath. There are no toilets from Gaurikund to Kedarnath. Pilgrims wait in three-km-long lines for six to seven hours for darshan but there is no facility to provide them with shelter from the rain. They are falling ill because of this mismanagement.‚Äù

However, Manoj Semval, Food Security Officer of Rudraprayag, refuted these allegations. ‚ÄúWe took a tour of Kedarnath and there were no complaints of overpriced and poor quality food. The prices are a bit high due to the cost of transporting goods to a higher altitude. We found no substandard food.‚Äù

Spate of deaths

As many as 74 pilgrims have died en route to the four shrines situated at high altitudes, ranging between 10,000 ft and 12,000 ft, since the start of the yatra on May 3, according to the State Health Department data as of May 25.

Thirty-seven pilgrims have died on their way to Kedarnath, 20 en route to Yamunotri, 13 to Badrinath and four to Gangotri. A majority of those who died were above 60 years and had heart ailments and comorbidities. Ganesh Mehulkar, a pilgrim from Jalna in Maharashtra, says, ‚ÄúA man died before my eyes due to cardiac arrest and no medical help could be provided to him.‚Äù

Pilgrims trekking to Yamunotri and Kedarnath shrines have complained of facing difficulties in receiving timely medical care. Ram Sharan Agarwal, 69, from Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, says, ‚ÄúThere are many elderly people like me who are on this journey. When pilgrims reach Lincholi, on the trek to Kedarnath, they suffer from breathlessness due to the high altitude and decreasing oxygen levels. Owing to the heavy rush, not everyone is able to gain access to oxygen cylinders at the medical centres.‚Äù

Sandeep Gusain, a 32-year-old YouTuber, expressed his disappointment at the medical facilities. ‚ÄúFollowing the floods in 2013, the hospital at Kedarnath was damaged and it is still under construction. The existing hospital does not have room for even 100 people.‚Äù

Sukhdeo Krishna Mahajan, 65, from Surat in Gujarat, says there are accidents on the crowded trekking path because of the movement of ponies. ‚ÄúDue to frequent rains, the path is slippery and this has led to mishaps. I have seen several women pilgrims get injured, but medical treatment is available only after three or four hours of trekking.‚Äù

Dr. Bharat Sharma at Sigma Hospital in Kedarnath says about 500 pilgrims suffering from cold and fever arrive every day. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt get acclimatised to the weather while coming by helicopter.‚Äù According to Dr. K.S. Chauhan, Chief Medical Officer (CMO), Uttarkashi district, pilgrims who do not clear medical screening are being sent back. Dr. B.K. Shukla, CMO of Rudraprayag, says 700 to 1,000 pilgrims are being screened daily. ‚ÄúEvery two km, we have set up medical relief posts. There are two hospitals in Kedarnath, one in Sonprayag and 12 medical centres along the trekking route. While two pilgrims with head injuries were airlifted to the AIIMS in Rishikesh, 19 pilgrims who fell ill were airlifted to Phata for medical care.‚Äù Director General of Health Dr. Shailja Bhatt has advised pilgrims against travelling if they are not medically fit.

On May 24, pilgrims were asked to halt their journey as a precautionary measure after the region received fresh snowfall and heavy rain. Helicopter services to Kedarnath were also suspended. However, with the weather improving the next morning, pilgrims waiting in Sonprayag and Gaurikund were allowed to proceed to the four temples.

Environmental concerns

The influx of tourists has left environmentalists worried as pilgrims have littered the trekking route with garbage, posing a threat to the State‚Äôs rivers.

Ravi Chopra, former chairman of the Supreme Court-appointed High Powered Committee to oversee the Char Dham road-widening project, says, ‚ÄúThe movement of diesel-powered buses and taxis is releasing large amounts of black soot, which causes rapid melting of glaciers. Helicopters are also emitting black carbon. Apart from this, pilgrims are leaving behind a large amount of trash, particularly in Joshimath and Guptkashi. Our natural resources are being badly affected by this anthropogenic pressure. The footfall needs to be monitored to protect the ecology of this Himalayan terrain.‚Äù

Eminent geologist Navin Juyal says since the Char Dham Yatra is a major source of employment, environmental concerns take a back seat. ‚ÄúPeople are not so conscious about the environment in Uttarakhand. They are just happy that the yatra has resumed and pilgrims are thronging the shrines. They only see the short-term gain. But this terrain can‚Äôt accommodate such crowds. The sustainability factor should always be kept in mind while making policies.‚Äù

Grappling with the rush of pilgrims, Uttarakhand Director General of Police Ashok Kumar was recently seen in a video reminding pilgrims that the Char Dham Yatra would continue till October. ‚ÄúI appeal to people to not make plans in a hurry,‚Äù he says in the video.

However, pilgrims aren‚Äôt willing to turn back. Godri Girpad, a 69-year-old farmer from Maharashtra, says, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt return without the darshan of Badrinath and Kedarnath. Sab dev baar-baar, ek baar Badri-Kedar [One may visit other gods several times, but one receives more blessings by visiting Badrinath and Kedarnath just once].‚Äù",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Bengaluru and Lucknow flooding this year are fresh in our minds. That two capital cities could not prevent flooding events is only partially explained as an outcome of global warming that led to incessant high rains and consequent flooding.

A city that prides itself as the IT capital of the world could not invent any app or smart IT solutions to save itself and boats were needed to rescue people.

Yes, Bengaluru received a record-breaking 180 mm of rainfall in a span of three hours in a day. Lucknow received 160 mm of rainfall over 24 hours. One can say that no drainage system could cope with this record-breaking rain.

But isn't urban planning for cities supposed to address urban flooding as a primary goal? The great cities of Moscow and Paris pride themselves on addressing one-in-a-hundred-years flooding by building massive stormwater drainage systems that have successfully prevented flooding in these cities.

What is there in the master plans of Indian cities that address stormwater drainage as a priority? What do Bengaluru and Lucknow have to show for their master planning, given the huge investment in urban infrastructure in these cities in the last two decades? Almost nothing.

COVID-19 woke everyone up to a pandemic that was induced by a virus. The pandemic impacted everyone, even though it impacted the poor more in terms of their existing vulnerable livelihoods and living conditions.

There is a silent virus of unplanned urbanisation in most of Asia and Africa's cities that are a silent killer like COVID-19.

Our megacities in South Asia have flouted the basic urban planning norm ‚Äî the density of housing and planned growth, roads cutting across natural drains and the sheer growth of our large cities that requires massive grey infrastructure investments in drainage and sewerage.

It is not just flooding. We just recovered from record-breaking summer temperatures and urban climate crisis this year.

What we have is a large majority of urban population in India and several other countries of the global south ‚Äî that is now subjected to regular and frequent twin and almost simultaneous disasters of heat impacts and water scarcity, followed by monsoon flooding.

Our cities are thirsty for water for nine months and drown in our excreta and stormwater mismanagement in the monsoons. Uttar Pradesh did not have much rain till mid-September and then suddenly, the heavens poured.

Our large cities have grown into large built-up concrete spaces with no regard for the urban watershed they now constitute. The volume of surface flow Bengaluru generates is not what its urban drainage and sewerage infrastructure were designed to handle.

Read more: A ‚ÄòOne Water‚Äô approach is key to combat urban challenges, manage resources



The sheer extent of the built-up area now creates its own surface water flow in volumes never seen before. The roads became the waterway for the Bengaluru floods of 2022.

Our sewerage system is combined stormwater drainage and sewerage system. Roads of our cities have trunk sewer lines flowing underground. We either have no stormwater drains and drainage systems and, if they do exist, they are not connected to a city stormwater drainage system.

Given the unplanned and increasing density of our cities, our sewers cannot convey even a tiny increase in the volume of water from even a small rainfall episode. The sewers open up and spill all the excreta and stormwater on the roads.

Natural drainage systems have indeed been disrupted by roads and encroachment of water ways, that urban lakes and water bodies are filled up and there is no place for water to seep in, recharge and reduce the surface flow.

It is also true that we need a ramped-up grey infrastructure of a stormwater drainage system and a stormwater plan for our cities to handle rainfall episodes of up to 180mm in a day.

This is nowhere a priority at the national level in any of the urban missions and programmes, nor at the state and city levels. The urban water discourse suffers from the paranoia of groundwater recharge, of more and more water recharge to address falling water levels in our cities.

Understanding urban flooding and stormwater drainage for our cities is not prioritised anywhere.

Read more: Delhi rain, waterlogging puts the spotlight on urban flooding



While a vaccine was created for COVID-19 and administered to individuals, the vaccine for unplanned urbanisation is a retrofitting of stormwater drainage and sewerage into our dense unplanned unauthorised and informal settlements (many of which have been formalised as a political gesture) and slums.

But to do this, you will need to widen the roads to create drainage and sewerage systems, create some open spaces for other related public infrastructure or even allow for sun and air to make the area livable. And this will require demolishing some houses and relocating people elsewhere or within the same area.

Who will do this? Where is the political will to address unplanned urban growth in India? Everything currently revolves around short-term election promises of providing tenure entitlements to the slums and unauthorised settlements.

The thinking, the planning and the funding needed for retrofitting our slums and unauthorised settlements for drainage and sewerage ‚Äî is just not there.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

At least 13 people, mainly Amarnath pilgrims, have died and dozens went missing after flash floods caused landslips near the Baltal base camp in central Kashmir‚Äôs Ganderbal area on Friday.

An official said the flash floods occurred around 5.30 p.m. and washed away scores of tents. ‚ÄúAt least 13 people are feared dead. The bodies are being retrieved and the missing being located,‚Äù a senior official said.

One estimate suggested that around 40 people are missing at the site of flash floods. Scores of injured were shifted to temporary medical camps set up in Baltal. ‚ÄúWe are planning to shift the seriously injured to hospitals in Srinagar,‚Äù another official said.

The exact location of cloudburst and flash floods is Kali Mata Y Junction, located at the lower Amarnath cave towards the Baltal base camp.

The yatra has been stopped for the time being.

A top meteorologist told The Hindu that there is yet no confirmation that a ‚Äòcloudburst‚Äô was responsible for the flooding.

A cloudburst, said M. Mohapatra, Director General, India Meteorological Department, would mean rainfall in excess of 10 cm an hour whereas data from instruments at the Amarnath cave suggest that it was no more than 2.5 cm. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt confirm that it was a cloudburst. However, it is possible that there was more rain in the northern stretches. But we have no measurements and so that cannot be confirmed.‚Äù

Cloudbursts are short-duration, intense rainfall events over a small area. The IMD defines it as a weather phenomenon with ‚Äúunexpected precipitation‚Äù exceeding 100mm/h over a geographical region of approximately 20-30 square km.

Meanwhile, several teams of the police, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have launched multiple rescue operations.

Briefs Modi

Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha briefed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah.

‚ÄúOur priority is to save the lives of people. Instructions have been issued to provide all necessary assistance to pilgrims. I am closely monitoring the situation,‚Äù Mr. Sinha said.

The Amarnath yatra resumed after three years this year. The annual yatra has twin routes of Pahalgam in south and Sonamarg in central Kashmir to reach the cave shrine. The shrine is located at an altitude of 3,657 metres to perform ‚Äòdarshan‚Äô.

What is Urban Flooding?

The flooding of land or property in a built environment, especially in densely populated cities where rainfall exceeds drainage systems' capacity, is known as urban flooding. It is a manmade disaster.

Urban flooding, in contrast to rural floods, which are caused by heavy rain over a flat or low-lying area, is caused not only by higher precipitation but also by unplanned urbanization.

Urban flooding in India

India's urban population is anticipated to reach 814 million by 2050. As a result, it is important for the government to focus on city master plans and urban renewal initiatives as essential components in order to reduce urban flooding.

BCCL/Representational Image

Urban floods are now a national problem in India, affecting mega and metropolitan areas almost every year. Ahmedabad was inundated by heavy rainfall in July 2022. The ground floors of many housing societies and bungalows were submerged.

Due to heavy rainfall in November 2021, several areas were submerged in Chennai which also led to blackouts and a few Chennai territories were marooned. Hyderabad faced unprecedented precipitation levels in October 2020, resulting in the deaths of nearly 50 people and the destruction of property worth over Rs 5000 crores. At various times, cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Patna, and Pune, were also flooded, bringing them to a halt for several days.

What causes it in India?

The original built-up area of Indian cities has expanded dramatically over the past two decades. New developments are taking place in low-lying areas of Indian cities and towns due to rising land prices and less availability of land in the city centre. Most of the time, these developments take place on encroachments over lakes, wetlands, and riverbeds.

In order to accommodate the higher flows of stormwater, it would have been ideal to widen the natural drains but large-scale encroachments have occurred without widening the natural drains. Thus, flooding occurs as the capacity of the natural drains is decreased.

BCCL/Representational Image

Climate change is leading to extreme weather and causing an increase in the frequency of short-duration heavy rainfall resulting in higher water run-off. Apart from that, floods in urban areas are also caused by the sudden and unplanned release of water from dams and lakes without giving the public enough time to respond.

According to NASA studies, the urban heat island effect also causes more rain to fall on urban areas and cause flooding. The hot air pushes the rain-bearing clouds higher as they pass over the urban heat island, resulting in highly localized and occasionally intense rainfall.

How does it impact?

Floods in urban areas frequently result in deaths and injuries, either directly or indirectly by causing water-borne diseases to spread during the event.

AFP/Representational Image

It causes structural damage to buildings, property, crops, etc. and also disrupts infrastructure like the water supply, sewerage, power lines, transmission lines, communication, and traffic on roads and railways.

Health problems including epidemics and plagues are invited by stagnant stormwater, contaminated drinking water and solid waste and sewage.

What can be done?

The most effective strategy for minimizing property and life loss is to construct them away from floodplains and other flood-prone areas. Also, rainwater harvesting should be included in all infrastructure constructions to ensure better water management. Along the sides of roads, bioswales should be constructed so that rainwater can percolate into the ground and flow toward them.

BCCL/Representational Image

The development of blue-green infrastructure will help in the situation. The term ""Blue-Green Infrastructure"" refers to a network that uses infrastructure, ecological restoration, and urban design to connect people with nature to solve urban and climate problems. Blue denotes tanks and water bodies, while green denotes parks, gardens, and trees.

For better development planning, geospatial technology should be used for flood vulnerability mapping. Further, natural water bodies should be strictly desilted and maintained to ensure the free flow of excess water.

‚ÄúFloods, droughts, heatwaves, extreme storms and wildfires are going from bad to worse, breaking records with alarming frequency. Heatwaves in Europe. Colossal floods in Pakistan. Prolonged and severe droughts in China, the Horn of Africa and the United States. There is nothing natural about the new scale of these disasters. They are the price of humanity‚Äôs fossil fuel addiction,‚Äù said Ant√≥nio Guterres, UN Secretary General while releasing the report. ‚ÄúThis year‚Äôs United in Science report shows climate impacts heading into uncharted territory of destruction. Yet each year we double down on this fossil fuel addiction, even as the symptoms get rapidly worse.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith half of Delhi‚Äôs population living in low-income settlements and highly vulnerable to extreme heat, this heatwave led to devastating socioeconomic and public health impacts,‚Äù said the report. But other cities in other countries were also hit badly. ‚Äú Low-lying coastal cities and settlements, such as Bangkok (Thailand), Houston (US) and Venice (Italy), are highly likely to face more frequent and more extensive coastal flooding due to sea-level rise, storm surges and subsidence‚Ä¶ cities ‚Äì home to 55% of the global population, or 4.2 billion people ‚Äì are responsible for up to 70% of human-caused emissions while also highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change such as increased heavy precipitation, accelerated sea-level rise, acute and chronic coastal flooding and extreme heat, among other key risks.‚Äù

The results of a rapid analysis showed that an unusually long and early onset heatwave spell like the one India and Pakistan experienced in late spring and early summer is very rare, with a chance of occurring only once in 100 years. But it is now about 30 times more likely to happen because of human-caused climate change, a rapid attribution analysis by an international team of leading climate scientists who are part of the World Weather Attribution network said in May. There were at least 90 deaths across India and Pakistan due to heat stress. The heat wave triggered an extreme Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) in northern Pakistan and forest fires in India, particularly in the hill states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. Extreme heat also reduced India‚Äôs wheat crop yields, causing the government to stop wheat exports.

Guterres called on developed countries to deliver on climate finance commitments for adaptation. ‚ÄúIt is a scandal that developed countries have failed to take adaptation seriously, and shrugged off their commitments to help the developing world. The Glasgow decision urges developed countries to collectively provide $40 billion dollars a year in new adaptation finance. This must be delivered in full, as a starting point. But it is clearly not enough. Adaptation finance needs are set to grow to at least $300 billion dollars a year by 2030,‚Äù he said.

United in Science‚Äôs prediction for the next 5 years suggests extreme weather events like Delhi‚Äôs extreme summer of 2022 are likely to be more frequent. The annual mean global near-surface temperature for each year from 2022-2026 is predicted to be between 1.1 degree C and 1.7 degree C higher than pre-industrial levels (1850-1900). The likelihood of the annual mean global near-surface temperature temporarily exceeding 1.5 degree C above pre-industrial levels for at least one of the next five years is 48% and is increasing with time.

There is also a 93% probability that at least one year in the next five will be warmer than the warmest year on record, 2016, and that the mean temperature for 2022‚Äì2026 will be higher than that of the last five years. The 2015 to 2021 period was the warmest on record as per analysis by WMO, referred to in the report. The 2018‚Äì2022 global mean temperature average (based on data up to May 2022) is estimated to be 1.17 ¬± 0.13 degree C above pre-industrial levels.

Global greenhouse gas emissions are also continuing to rise. Global CO2 emissions in 2021 returned to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 after falling by 5.4% in 2020 due to widespread lockdowns. Preliminary data shows that global CO2 emissions in 2022 (January to May) are 1.2% above the levels recorded during the same period in 2019 mainly driven by increases in the United States, India and most European countries, the report said.

As per various scenarios assessed by IPCC, global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak before 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by 43% by 2030 to keep global warming under 1.5 degree C.

Certain climate tipping points are also approaching, the report warned. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is an important driver of the distribution of heat, salt and water in the climate system, both regionally and globally. Recent research suggests AMOC may be weaker in the current climate than at any other time in the last millennium. The melting of the polar ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica is also considered a major tipping point that will lead to sea-level rise for hundreds to thousands of years. ‚ÄúRegional tipping points, such as the drying of the Amazon rainforest may have serious local consequences with cascading global impacts. Other examples include regional droughts which impact the global carbon cycle and disrupt major weather systems such as monsoons,‚Äù the report said.

A research paper led by Stockholm Resilience Centre, Stockholm University published in Science journal on September 9 provides an updated assessment of the most important climate tipping elements and their potential tipping points, including their temperature thresholds, time scales, and impacts. Their analysis indicates that even at global warming of 1 degree C, a threshold that we already have passed, puts the planet at risk of triggering some tipping points. For example, the Greenland Ice Sheet; the Boreal Permafrost; the Barrents Sea Ice; the West Atlantic Ice Sheet; the low-latitude coral reefs are reaching the tipping points before the 2 degree C global warming threshold is breached.

New national mitigation pledges for 2030 are insufficient according to the report which found that the ambition of these new pledges would need to be four times higher to get on track to limit warming to 2 degree C and seven times higher to get on track to 1.5 degree C.

‚ÄúThe report warns of dire socioeconomic consequences as global carbon emissions return to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Rich nations, whose wealth accumulation primarily caused the global warming, cannot abdicate their responsibility of providing finance to developing countries to tackle widespread climate impacts such as wildfires, floods, storms and droughts. As half of the world‚Äôs population is living in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change, we need to drastically reduce emissions, urgently strengthen adaptation efforts and scale up measures to deal with losses and damages caused by climate disasters,‚Äù Harjeet Singh, head of Global Political Strategy at Climate Action Network International.",issue,2022 Pakistan floods,Pakistan,14-May-22,28-May-22,"Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan",100-200 mm,$10 billion,120,"1.2 million people affected, 3.8 million acres of crops damaged, 100,000 homes damaged or destroyed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

In doing so, the court ordered the bank to pay Rs 18 lakh to the family of the victim.

Ever since, the defence of ‚ÄòAct of God‚Äô has remained in public discussion. In 2020, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had also said that the economy was facing an Act-of-God-like situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

New Delhi: When Paresh Rawal‚Äôs character, Kanji Lalji Mehta, in the movie ‚ÄòOMG‚ÄìOh My God!‚Äô loses his shop to an earthquake, he is denied insurance because his policy does not cover damages caused by an ‚ÄòAct of God‚Äô. He then goes ahead and sues God.

However, what does the defence of Act of God exactly mean? When is it accepted as a defence by courts and when is it rejected by courts? ThePrint explains.

What does Act of God mean

Act of God, or Vis Major in Latin, is defined as an ‚Äúoverwhelming, unpreventable event caused exclusively by forces of nature, such as an earthquake, flood, or tornado.‚Äù The defence is usually taken by any party to a case who wants to escape liability for any incident, citing a natural calamity. The defence arises out of a tort or civil law principle that a person cannot be held liable if the fault lies in an Act of God, and when the person had taken all precautions.

However, courts have explained that the defence would not help and cannot be taken in an event which is anticipated or is likely to take place from time to time. The test is not that the natural event was extraordinary, but that it could not be reasonably anticipated. In other words, to take the defence, natural events such as rain, high-velocity winds, snow or landslides should have been so unexpected that ‚Äúno human foresight or skill could reasonably have anticipated the event‚Äù.

Therefore, when the Delhi high court directed compensation of Rs 18 lakh to be paid to the family of a man who died as a result of injuries after one of Bank of Baroda‚Äôs signboards fell on him, it explained that the defence of act of God can be accepted only ‚Äúwhere the occurrence is unprecedented and unforeseeable‚Äù.

In insurance cases, the definition of Act of God varies as per the insurer. Several insurers cover losses due to acts of God and natural disasters. However, the insurance policy usually defines what sort of natural disasters it covers.

Further, as per Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs new guidelines for the hiring of safe deposit lockers from banks, the bank will not be liable for your loss if the content of the locker is lost or damaged due to natural calamities or Acts of God like earthquakes and floods. However, banks are required to take reasonable precautions to secure their facilities from such natural disasters.

‚ÄòAvoidable incidents‚Äô

Courts have also emphasized on the need for taking preventative action and reasonable care by the party wanting to use Act of God as a defence.

In January this year, the Supreme Court set aside an Allahabad high court judgment which had ruled that the fire in the warehouse of a company was an ‚ÄòAct of God‚Äô and exempted excise liability of the company engaged in the manufacture of liquor.

The apex court explained, ‚ÄúWhen nothing of any external natural force had been in operation in a violent or sudden manner, the event of the fire in question could be referable to anything but to an Act of God in legal parlance.‚Äù

The court also said that with appropriately laid fireproof electrical installations as also firefighting measures, ‚Äúthe incident was an avoidable one or at least the loss could have been minimized‚Äù.

In 2016, the Supreme Court had also ruled that if the damage has resulted from two or three causes ‚Äî from an Act of God as well as a negligent act of a party ‚Äî damages can be awarded to compensate only the injury that can be attributed to the negligent act of the respondents.

2001 Gujarat earthquake: When court rejected Act of God defence

Therefore, courts don‚Äôt accept the defence of Act of God in all circumstances, even when there is a natural calamity.

For instance, in December 2010, the Gujarat high court awarded compensation of Rs 3.75 lakh each to the families of 32 students who were killed inside an Ahmedabad school premises during the 2001 earthquake.

The judgment was pronounced after the four-storey building of Shree Swaminarayan School collapsed following an earthquake on 26 January 2001, leading to the death of 32 children. Parents and relatives of 26 children demanded compensation from the school authorities. They had contended that the school authorities and the construction company constructed the school building, consisting of four stories with 25 rooms, office, and giant water tank, within a period of two and half months. They had pointed out several deficiencies in the construction of the school building.

In their defence, the school authorities as well as the construction company had taken the defence of Act of God. However, the court rejected their defence, and observed, ‚ÄúThere is no doubt about the fact that an earthquake is a natural calamity or an Act of God which is beyond the control of any human being. At the same time it cannot be lost sight of that the appellants were duty bound to construct the school building in a proper manner, taking care that the foundations were structurally strong, the nature of soil was conducive to the construction and the construction was carried out in the manner it ought to be, using good quality materials.‚Äù

The court explained that if proper and reasonable care was not taken by the school authorities, they cannot escape liability, taking the defence of Act of God. It added, ‚ÄúThe earthquake may be a natural calamity but had proper care been taken in the construction of the school building, may be the tragedy would not have taken place.‚Äù

delhi,2022,https://indianexpress.com/article/world/climate-change/major-climate-change-related-events-2022-yearender-8351977/,31-Dec-22,Pakistan floods to drought in Europe: Major climate change-related events in 2022,"The devastating flood in Pakistan, heatwave and drought in Europe, and above average wildfires in the US put the focus back on climate change in 2022. As the year draws to a close, we take a look at the important events in 2022.

Pakistan witnessed one of the worst floods in its recent history this year. Reports said that about 110 of the 150 districts in the country were affected by the flooding, which started in July but continued to worsen over the next month. The flood was a direct result of an extremely wet monsoon season this year, with more than the usual spells of rain witnessed in the country.

‚ÄúPakistan has never seen an unbroken cycle of monsoon like this. Eight weeks of non-stop torrents have left huge swathes of the country under water. This is no normal season. This is a deluge from all sides, impacting 33 million plus people which is the size of a small country,‚Äù Pakistan‚Äôs Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman said on Twitter.

According to Pakistan‚Äôs National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the floods affected nearly 15% of the country‚Äôs population (around 33 million people), making it a more widespread disaster than the 2010 ‚Äòsuperflood‚Äô in which about 20 million people were affected. Pakistani media reported that more than half of the country was under water this year, with millions rendered homeless.

Heatwave and drought in Europe

This summer, Europe saw a heatwave which broke several records: for example, some places in the UK recorded temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius, the first time this mark was breached in the country. In France too, a few places recorded temperatures in excess of 45 degrees Celsius ‚Äî another all-time high for a country.

This is representative of the larger trend of temperatures across the world rising due to climate change. Considering the average annual temperature, the last eight years have been the hottest ever recorded through direct measurements since the 1880s, a NASA analysis had shown, with 2021 being the sixth hottest year ever recorded.

Along with the heatwave, Europe also experienced a severe drought, billed as the worst one in 500 years.

India updates its NDC (nationally determined commitments)

In August, the Indian government said the country would reduce its emission intensity by at least 45 per cent, instead of the earlier commitment of 33 to 35 per cent, from 2005 levels by 2030. Another enhancement was that at least 50 per cent of India‚Äôs total electricity generation would come from renewable sources by 2030, an upgrade from the earlier 40 per cent.

These came months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a few headline-grabbing promises at the climate change conference in Glasgow in 2021. The NDC is a part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, that requires every country to set self-determined climate targets which are supposed to be progressively updated with more ambitious goals every few years. India‚Äôs first NDC was submitted in 2015, just before the Agreement was finalised.

Climate Change Performance Index: India jumps ahead of developed countries

Released at the COP27, the Climate Change Performance Index put India at the eighth position (two ranks above its previous place) on a list of 59 countries and the European Union.

India was ahead of most developed countries on the list: the UK was ranked 11, Germany 16, while China and the United States were placed at 51st and 52nd ranks respectively. Meanwhile, Denmark and Sweden were assessed to be the top performers this year as well.

‚ÄúIndia earns a high rating in the GHG Emissions and Energy Use categories, with a medium for Climate Policy and Renewable Energy. The country is on track to meet its 2030 emissions targets (compatible with a well-below 2 degree Celsius scenario). However, the renewable energy pathway is not on track for the 2030 target,‚Äù a statement accompanying the index said.

Russia-Ukraine war and its effects on renewable energy

Retaliating against sanctions imposed upon Russia by Western countries, President Vladimir Putin reduced gas supply to Europe by nearly 90 per cent. Russia supplied forty per cent of Europe‚Äôs gas, and imports had continued even after the sanctions‚Äî these were due to the invasion of Ukraine in February this year and the subsequent Russia-Ukraine war. This led to energy shortages across Europe, which impacted inflation in the countries as well.

COP27: Loss and damage fund

This year, the COP27, held at Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, became a major milestone in the global response to climate change, due to the decision of setting up a loss and damage fund, which was a key demand of developing countries. The ‚Äúloss and damage‚Äù refers to costs the rich and developed countries, who are majorly responsible for industrial emissions that pollute the environment, should pay to poorer nations that have made negligible contribution to pollution but are more vulnerable to extreme climate events (for example, the Pakistan floods).

However, this was the only bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming conference. COP27 was built up as the ‚Äòimplementation COP‚Äô or the meeting that would accelerate the actions being taken on climate change; this expectation would unfortunately not translate into reality.

India, for its part, sought a phase-down of all fuels and not just coal (at various points, India has asserted that it will not phase down coals due to its energy needs). It also called out the duplicity of developed countries, arguing that the selective labelling of some energy sources as ‚Äògreen‚Äô had no basis in science.

Climate change ‚Äòactivists‚Äô deface paintings to protest against climate change

One of the most bizarre things to happen in the fight against climate change this year was the defacement of iconic paintings by a climate activist group calling for a halt to all new oil and gas consents and licences.

The activist group shot into public view on October 14 when two activists threw tomato soup at Vincent van Gogh‚Äôs Sunflowers in the National Gallery in London. Eventually, the group and its way of protesting went beyond London. A few weeks later, German police arrested two people for throwing mashed potatoes at a Claude Monet painting in Germany‚Äôs Barberini Museum museum. In late October, a video surfaced on social media of two men standing close to Johannes Vermeer‚Äôs Girl with a Pearl Earring, housed in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague. One man is seen trying to superglue his bald head to the painting while another empties a can of tomato soup over the first man‚Äôs head.

These protests triggered global debates on not just climate change, but also activism and civil disobedience in modern society.

Above-average wildfire season in US

The United States saw 64,835 wildfires in 2022, the most since 2017. According to USA Today, together this amounted to the burning of more than 7.4 million acres, which is higher than the 10-year average (in both number of fires as well as acres burned).

According to scientists, climate change is continuously worsening wildfires, both in terms of intensity and impact. They expect conditions to further worsen in the coming years, as a result of various factors: global warming, droughts, storms, forests destroyed by hurricanes, urbanisation and conflicts over how to manage land to prevent extreme fires.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Locals said that a few enthusiasts are spotted on river banks throughout the year but it is during the monsoon and floods that people passionate about fishing pursue their hobby. These include people from all sections and classes of people and hail from all age groups. Many of them take leave from their jobs and many businessmen take out time from their businesses to pursue their hobby.

However, it is the aged men having past experience who are usually successful in catching fish on the river banks using their fishing rods which they assemble themselves.

A thin bamboo stick, some strong string, fishing hooks, earthworms or some kneaded flour as bait are enough to assemble a fishing pole, says 55-year-old Daddan Miya who has been pursuing this hobby of fishing during the rains for the past 35 years.

Having caught four fish of good size in three hours, at the Karelabagh Ghat on Yamuna on Tuesday, Daddan Miya claims that he is good at observing the exact place where he is likely to find fish.

Hi-tech fishing rods are also available in the market which are costly and are specially designed. However, fishers in Prayagraj are still using the traditional self-assembled fishing poles. While the bamboo stick can be plucked or purchased, the fishing hooks of different size, string etc can be found only at shops in localities close to river banks.

‚ÄúAngling is a passion that requires experience, skill and patience. I have seen people change their places frequently in the hope to catch fish but returning empty handed in the evening. There are youths who cannot wait even for two hours at the river bank after throwing the bait. They become impatient if they do not catch a fish soon and return. Catching a fish requires patience and I have waited for long hours to catch a single fish many times,‚Äù says 60‚Äìyear-old Ainuddin of Dariyabad while waiting for a catch at a ghat.

Sitting with pole in hand and bait in the water at Baluaghat, is Ranjeet Kumar, a 30-year-old grocer. ‚ÄúI started angling with my friends five years back. I usually do not get much time to pursue my passion. However, this season is the best time to catch fish,‚Äù said Ranjeet, who caught three fish in five hours on Tuesday.

With smartphone in hand and mobile phone network available at the ghat, it is very easy to pass time and avoid boredom while angling, says Rajjan, an angler in Phaphamau. ‚ÄúFor the past week I come every day to the ghat with some food and return in the evening. Some days I have caught even large fish,‚Äù he claimed.

Meanwhile, the water levels of the Yamuna and Ganga again started rising in the last 24 hours, after showing a receding trend for two days.

On Tuesday, at 4pm, the water level in the Ganga was recorded 82.10 meters at Phaphamau while it was 81.39 meters at Chhatnag. The danger level at both paces is 84.73 meters.

The water level in Yamuna was recorded at 81.99 meters in Naini on Tuesday. The danger level here is also at 84.73 meters.",discussion,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
delhi,2022,https://www.eco-business.com/news/twin-crises-of-heat-and-floods-expose-neglect-in-india-and-bangladesh/,29-May-22,Twin crises of heat and floods expose neglect in India and Bangladesh,"Rains over the weekend brought some relief from a sweltering heatwave to northern India, but temperatures are projected to rise again. Last week the heat in New Delhi, India‚Äôs capital, matched that of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, and is predicted to do so again this week. At the same time, India‚Äôs northeastern region and the neighbouring country of Bangladesh have been battered by heavy rainfall and floods.

Simultaneous disasters are becoming more common in South Asia as the climate changes, but preparation for them is limited. Much of the damage caused by floods has been exacerbated by ill-conceived development projects that have ignored environmental concerns and local input.

Climate connect, political disconnect on urban green spaces

The connection between climate change and the two crises of heat and flooding is clear. Strikingly, the UK‚Äôs Meteorological Office has said that ‚Äúhuman influence has increased the likelihood of extreme April-May temperature anomalies [in northern India and Pakistan] by a factor of about 100‚Äù, and that by the end of the century the likelihood of heatwaves in the region will increase by 275 times from the natural state.

In such a situation, one would expect the Indian government to be scrambling to implement action plans. To a degree it is ‚Äì and has been setting up early warning systems. The problem is that action on heat warnings is undermined by inaction on more long-term measures. According to the National Disaster Management Authority, a key adaptive measure is ‚Äúland use strategies to reduce the urban heat island effect, including green infrastructure, cool roofs, trees, and vegetation, and increasing green spaces‚Äù.

‚Äú The frightening news is that we do not see a dry weather spell any time soon. The weather will continue to remain wet for as long as weather models can predict. Bazlur Rashid, meteorologist, Bangladesh Meteorological Department

In January, Bhupender Yadav, India‚Äôs environment minister, proudly released the Forest Survey of India report, claiming forest cover has grown. A closer examination, though, revealed that the survey did not distinguish between tea estates, agro-forestry and true forest cover, and what was in fact a decline in green areas was being passed off as an increase. The government also has a habit of announcing action on urban forests that never see the light of day, despite years of repetition. This is in line with many plans for better cities that are not being implemented.

More floods coming, but little preparation

The connection between climate change and the floods that began last week is also fairly clear. In a statement, independent weather expert Sanjay Srivastava said the moisture in the region is due to a cyclone, Asani. Asani petered out over the Bay of Bengal in mid-May after threatening India‚Äôs east coast, but not before pushing rainclouds inland from the sea. Cyclones are becoming more frequent and more powerful due to climate change, with the likelihood of flooding in India increasing by 50-90 per cent in the lowest emission scenario.

The impact is devastating. The Assam Disaster Management Authority said that of 33 districts in the northeast Indian state, 22 had been affected by 22 May, impacting more than 700,000 people and 95,000 hectares of crops. Twelve people have died and over 90,000 people are already in government-run relief camps.

Bridges, rail tracks and roads were washed away or hit by landslides, affecting communication not only to parts of Assam but also to other states in the region ‚Äì Tripura, Mizoram and Manipur. The floods affected forests, including in the famous Kaziranga National Park, home to the world‚Äôs largest population of one-horned rhinoceros.

Shoddy infrastructure worsens floods in India

What makes this situation more problematic is that infrastructure development continues as if we are living in a business-as-usual scenario. Work is often shoddy and certainly does not factor in greater likelihood of catastrophes.

Dams in upstream Arunachal Pradesh and in Assam ‚Äì many of them half-finished ‚Äì have not only failed to hold back the floods, but have also sometimes channelled the rivers to flood new areas. Embankments meant to prevent flooding have instead prevented the gradual spread of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries into their floodplains, while the embankments collapse when the rainfall turns heavy. Poorly planned dredging operations meant to improve navigability in the Brahmaputra have led to silt being dumped on riverbanks. Heavy rain has now carried this silt into villages and inundated homes.

Landslides have been particularly severe on the southern bank of the Brahmaputra in Assam. This is the region where the Meghalaya plateau slopes towards the river. Illegal coal mining in many parts of Meghalaya and a few adjoining parts of Assam has led to rivers being blocked by mine tailings. Now, after heavy rainfall, the water that would have flown down those rivers has instead loosened soil along hill slopes, leading to many landslides.

Bangladesh suffers from similar inaction on climate disasters

The aforementioned study on cyclones and their impact on flooding also found increased likelihood of flooding in Bangladesh. But that country, too, seems to be reacting slowly and poorly.

In north and northeastern parts of Bangladesh, weather forecasters say the current bout of heavy rainfall may turn into early monsoon rainfall. By mid-May, the South Asian monsoon had reached southern Sri Lanka, and is moving towards the mainland about a week ahead of schedule.

Enamur Rahman, state minister for disaster management and relief, told The Third Pole that the floods have to date affected more than a million families. ‚ÄúOf them, around 6,000 families have been severely impacted and took shelter in the flood shelters. The government of Bangladesh is providing all kinds of support including food and medical services,‚Äù he said.

The Bangladesh Department of Agricultural Extension has advised farmers in the affected regions to harvest their summer paddy crops even if they have not matured fully. It warned that the crops may be flooded otherwise.

The Bangladesh Water Development Board issued an alert for people living on chars (riverine islands) in the Teesta, a major tributary of the Brahmaputra. The Brahmaputra (called Jamuna in Bangladesh) and Padma rivers continue to swell.

‚ÄúThe frightening news is that we do not see a dry weather spell any time soon,‚Äù meteorologist Bazlur Rashid told the media. ‚ÄúThe weather will continue to remain wet for as long as weather models can predict.‚Äù

Abandoning the poor

People who live on riverine islands ‚Äì both in India and Bangladesh ‚Äì are often among the poorest of the population. The limited infrastructure available in these areas is often damaged by frequent floods. And yet, year after year, the residents of such areas are largely abandoned to the fury of the worsening climate crisis.

In Bangladesh, there have been a number of projects initiated by the government as well as NGOs, such as the Char Development and Settlement Project and Chars Livelihood Programme. However, these projects only help with adaptation.

This year, food price inflation is adding to worry about loss of crops and profits. Food price inflation had reached alarming levels in India and Bangladesh before the current spell of rain, and both governments are being forced to drastically increase the number of people who receive subsidised food. From 1 June, under a programme announced before the floods, 10 million people in Bangladesh will be eligible for subsidised essentials.

Although the waters have receded, the flooding has left behind unsanitary conditions in which dangerous pathogens can easily spread. Medicine and clean water are scarce in this remote area of Pakistan.

Makai is staying in a flood shelter 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) from her home and tries to cool her crying infant son with a handheld fan.

The 11-month-old fidgets on a plastic floor mat constantly scratching his skin, which has been infected with scabies. Two of her other children are also infected. The ailment is spread by microscopic mites that burrow into the skin.

""Look at the rashes and scabs on his body. He scrapes them with fingers and cries, while the humid heat adds to his misery in this tent,"" Makai told DW. The temperature hovers around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) with 60% humidity.

Flood destruction displaces communities

Much of Swat district is situated in a river valley surrounded by mountains and it was one of the worst hit areas in northern Pakistan by last month's record flooding, which washed away infrastructure and houses.

Local authorities set up tent camps for displaced people on the grounds of a school. Makai said she received medicated cream for scabies after arriving at the camp, but was not given any further medical assistance.

Cholera, diarrhea and dysentery are also spreading in the displacement camps due to lack of clean water.

Nauman Khan from the Pakistan Islamic Medical Association (PIMA), a medical NGO, told DW at a camp in Swat's capital, Saidu Sharif, that stagnant rainwater used for drinking and washing was spreading disease.

Cases of mosquito-borne dengue fever have also been reported. Khan said mosquito nets and repellent are needed.

He added that women are also unable to maintain menstrual hygiene, as pads and tampons are not available.

""I detected eight cases of yeast infection in just one day and found the repeated use of a piece of cloth [by menstruating women] caused it,"" he said. Women are also unable to access pain relievers.

A 23-year-old woman told DW anonymously that the tablets and herbal tea normally used to treat menstrual pain are not available.

""We have to drink warm water or walk around for relief, but those home remedies fail to save us from the embarrassment of men knowing about a matter very private for us,"" she said.

Medicine in short supply

Aid organizations say more medicine is urgently needed to stop the spread of waterborne diseases after the flooding. Pharmacies are out of painkillers, antibiotics, and medicines for skin and gynecological issues, diabetes and eye infections.

Asadullah Khan, an aid worker from the Pakistani social welfare charity Edhi Foundation, told DW that many of his acquaintances in Swat have contacted relatives in other parts of Pakistan hoping to acquire insulin and other medicine, only to find pharmacies are out of stock.

Khan, who is based in the Swat valley's northern Kalam region, added a World Health Organization (WHO) team visited a local hospital and promised provision of essential medicines and other goods.

Pharmaceutical companies have blamed the government for drug shortages, as a price cap has raised the cost of production and led to suspended manufacturing.

""When a finished product costs us [companies] more than the allowed price, how we will continue manufacturing it? It's the simple principle of doing business,"" Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association chairman Hamid Raza told DW.

He added the issue would be resolved if the government hiked prices in proportion to inflation.

Swat District health officer Mohammad Saleem Khan told DW that a health crisis could spread out of control if medical supplies are not provided soon.

""We [health department] are trying our best to ensure the availability of medicines but things are fast worsening. We need more medicine,"" he said.

New Delhi : Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal continued to engaged in a 'tweet war' of sorts with his Assam counterpart on Sunday, with the AAP leader repeatedly asking when he could come see the schools of the northeastern state. The argument began on Wednesday after Kejriwal opined that closure of schools was not a solution and emphasised the need to open more schools across the country. He had shared the link to a news report claiming a ""closure"" of some schools in the northeastern state to underscore his point.

""Today you are expressing your desire to come to Assam Arvind Kejriwal sir. I am sad and sorry that such a desire of yours does not arise when the people of our Assam face a horrific natural calamity like floods! And yes, invitation has already been sent to your Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia ji from Assam,"" read the latest tweet from Sarma.

He had been responding to Kejriwal's repeated inquiries about a visit. ""We have a proverb here. Someone asks 'when shall I come' and you say 'come anytime' which means 'don't ever come'. I asked you 'when should I come to see your government school' you didn't even tell. Tell me when I will come, then I will come,"" Kejriwal had tweeted in Hindi earlier on Saturday.

As the debate escalated, Sarma had taken to Twitter with a series of posts to ""help"" Kejriwal understand some of the differences between Delhi and Assam and urged him to ""do his homework"" before commenting.

""Dear Arvind Kejriwal ji, your ignorance is painful. Let me help you. Assam is 50 times bigger than Delhi! Our 44521 government schools teach 65 lakh students - against your 1000+ odd schools. Our army of dedicated teachers number 2+ lakh; Midday meal workers 1.18 lakh. Fathom it?"" he had tweeted.

The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) has tallied three deaths in the Bicol region on the main Luzon island, two in the central region, and eight in the southern region, reports Xinhua news agency.

The Council however, did not specify the cause of death.

For the missing people, the NDRRMC said eight were in the Bicol region, 12 in the central Philippines, and three in the southern Philippines.

Six others were reported injured.

The NDRRMC added the flooding displaced almost 170,000 people in six regions across the archipelagic country.

Over 45,000 evacuated people are now housed in at least 87 government shelters while the rest stayed with relatives.

The disaster agency said that almost 534 houses were either totally or partially damaged by heavy rain and flooding.

The floods have rendered at least 15 roads and three bridges inaccessible.

The national state weather bureau warned late Monday night that there will ""moderate to heavy rains with, at times, intense rains"" in the country and ""flooding and rain-induced landslides are likely"".

Resumption of two-way trade between India and Pakistan will ‚Äúnot happen‚Äù any time soon and certainly not before both decide to have normal diplomatic ties with the reinstatement of envoys in each country, official sources told ThePrint.

New Delhi : A day after Pakistan expressed its willingness to resume bilateral trade with India, which was suspended by the former Imran Khan government in August 2019, New Delhi has made it clear that it will not take such a step in terms of ‚Äúnormalisation of trade‚Äù. However, India is ready to extend humanitarian aid and assistance for the flood-hit areas of the neighbouring country, ‚Äúbased on the kind of request‚Äù that comes from Islamabad.

The unprecedented flash floods have ravaged several parts of Pakistan, killing thousands and causing damage to the tune of $10 billion.

India has said it is ‚Äúopen‚Äù to sending vegetables and other food items, as well as medicines and essential items to Pakistan, on a ‚Äúcase-to-case‚Äù basis depending on the ‚Äúkind of request‚Äù that gets communicated from Islamabad to New Delhi, sources said.

As of now, no official request has been made by Pakistan to India to send food shipments there.

On Tuesday, Pakistan‚Äôs finance minister Miftah Ismail said that the Shehbaz Sharif government can ‚Äúconsider importing vegetables and other edible items from India‚Äù in the wake of the crisis situation there.

Following that, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his sympathies to Pakistan and extended his condolences in a tweet.

Saddened to see the devastation caused by the floods in Pakistan. We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims, the injured and all those affected by this natural calamity and hope for an early restoration of normalcy. ‚Äî Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) August 29, 2022

Resumption of trade will have to be from Pakistan‚Äôs side

Sources also indicated that since it was Pakistan that had stopped trade with India, the decision to resume it will also have to happen from their side. The decision will have to be formally proposed to India, post which the government will take a call on whether or not to resume it.

The issue had been discussed earlier too, when back-channel talks between India and Pakistan gained momentum for a brief period in February 2021, post the joint statement issued by the directors general of military operations (DGMOs) of both countries on maintaining ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC).

In August 2019 post the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the then Imran Khan-government had suspended trade with India, which happened via the Attari-Wagah border, and also downgraded diplomatic ties between the two countries.

Prior to that, in February 2019, India had stripped Pakistan of the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status due to the Pulwama attack.

Granting MFN status to each other will be tantamount to normalisation of trade between the two countries.

However, even after the suspension of trade by the Imran Khan government, India has continued to send pharmaceuticals, sugar and organic chemicals to Pakistan, post the issuance of notifications by the Pakistani customs authorities in 2019 and 2021.

Exports from India to Pakistan stood at $513.82 million in the 2021-2022 fiscal, according to official statistics issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

Pakistan is also reportedly importing Indian goods via Dubai, which is the main reason why the UAE has emerged as one of the largest trading partners of Pakistan, while trading directly will prove to be cost-effective for Islamabad.

Earlier this year, in June, just as the government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif came to power, Pakistan Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari hinted at resuming trading ties with India.

‚ÄúResumption of normal trade between India and Pakistan will be a slow and gradual process. But despite suspension of trade by Pakistan in 2019, India had been sending a whole range of items to that country based on the notifications issued by their customs,‚Äù said Nisha Taneja, professor, Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) and an expert on India-Pakistan trade.

She further said that India never restricted its exports to Pakistan, it only imposed a 200 per cent tariff on Pakistani imports after the Pulwama attack.

‚ÄúUnder the Shehbaz Sharif government there will be a push to resume normal trade. But for now, all they have to do is to have their customs issue a notification mentioning a list of items they need from India and it will be exported,‚Äù Taneja added.

NEW DELHI: Unprecedented floods in Bangladesh have affected around 7.2 million people. Since Bangladesh is dependent on India for the import of oils, cereals, iron, steel and so on, annual floods affect the purchasing power of the nation, leading to an economic balance between Bangladesh and India.

‚ÄúIt is important to realise that the annual floods in Bangladesh affect the purchasing power since Bangladesh will be investing more funds on damage reconstruction, reducing GDP and foreign reserve, so India will not be able to export its materials to the neighbouring country,‚Äù a political observer on India-Bangladesh, Tapas Das, told The Sunday Guardian.

With around 35 million tonnes produced yearly, Bangladesh is historically the third-largest producer of rice in the world, and almost all of that production is used to feed its population. To deal with shortages brought on by floods or droughts, imports are still frequently needed. In June 2022, the Sylhet region of Bangladesh witnessed the worst flooding in 122 years. As a result of the climate crisis, internal migration has increased, creating more disruptions during floods. Human actions like river grabbing, wetland grabbing, encroachment and so on had led to intense floods in Sylhet.

Not only Bangladesh, but India also witnessed severe floods in the northeastern region. Heavy rains in Assam and Meghalaya led to floods in India and Bangladesh as the rivers in the Brahmaputra basin flowing downwards could not reach the Bay of Bengal, although people living near the Brahmaputra region started taking measures like building flooding structures, hanging beds and so on. Bangladesh Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre has stated that the heavy rains in Assam and Meghalaya may lead to two rounds of floods due to unplanned embankment. The first round of floods took place on 10 May 2022, and the second round of floods took place on 16 June. Such severe floods also affect people psychologically. While speaking of the solution to tackle annual flooding problems, a researcher on South Asian policy and security issues, Debabrata Sen, told this newspaper. ‚ÄúThere is an urgent need for a holistic approach between the two countries to deal with floods or avoid the ravages of floods.

Communicating with the ordinary people to understand the ground scenario along with the holistic approach between the two countries is the need of the hour.‚Äù

Adding more on solutions, Das recommended, ‚ÄúThe possibility of implementing low-cost measures such as planting grass and shrubs, that spread by layer along river banks is the easiest way. Excess water can be channelled into other water-courses through canal systems to increase irrigation capacity.‚Äù",solution,2022 Bangladesh floods,Bangladesh,17-May-22,Present,"Sylhet Division, Rangpur Division, Mymensingh Division, Dhaka Division, Barisal Division, Chattogram Division",230 mm,$1.5 billion,128,7.2 million people affected,"The floods were caused by heavy rains in Assam and Meghalaya, India, which led to the Brahmaputra River overflowing its banks.

During the monsoon, many parts of Delhi, including arterial roads, get waterlogged leading to traffic snarls even with an hour‚Äôs rainfall. The main reason is the problems related to the city‚Äôs storm water drains. The city works on a drainage master plan made in 1976 and one such plan prepared by IIT Delhi for the Delhi government in 2018 is yet to be implemented. In an interview with The Hindu, Professor Emeritus of IIT Delhi, A.K. Gosain, whose team prepared the new plan, tells how the story of a new master plan turned out to be one of disappointment.

Why does Delhi face urban flooding?

In Delhi‚Äôs case, flooding could be due to two reasons: floods in the Yamuna or local rainfall. In 1978, Delhi had witnessed a flood due to a rise in the Yamuna water level. But the annual urban flooding we see is due to local rainfall. The run-off water (water left after being absorbed by the earth) from the local rainfall is supposed to drain into the Yamuna through storm water drains. But due to a combination of reasons, including sewage flowing in storm water drains, it does not properly drain into the Yamuna and leads to urban flooding. The drains were made decades ago to handle a particular amount of run-off water. Over the years, the paved area has increased due to development. So, if earlier, a particular amount of rainfall generated 50% of run-off water and the rest was absorbed by the earth, now the run-off water is about 90%. Also, due to climate change, the intensity of rainfall has increased and this also increases the amount of water. But the drainage system is the same and it is unable to handle the excess water.

Is Delhi‚Äôs natural topography a reason for urban flooding?

West Delhi is at a higher altitude and there is a slope towards the Yamuna and this actually aids water to drain into the Yamuna. If a city‚Äôs topography is flat, then it will be more prone to urban flooding. So, compared to Kolkata or Patna, Delhi is at an advantage in terms of topography. But the part of the city east of the Yamuna is a low-lying area.

How did IIT Delhi start working on Delhi‚Äôs drainage master plan?

In 2012, I was heading the civil engineering department at IIT Delhi and used to have meetings with the government on different issues. It was during one such meeting that the then secretary of the Irrigation Department of the Delhi government told me that they were trying to get a drainage master plan made for the city. The government had floated tenders and private companies were asking for ‚Çπ10-‚Çπ11 crore. We said that we could create a simulation model for the whole Delhi. This would be a framework that the government could upgrade and keep using. We submitted a proposal and agreed to do it for ‚Çπ80 lakh, which was less than 10% of what the private companies had quoted.

What is the master plan and why is it needed?

A master plan is needed to study why flooding is happening even with light rain and come up with a plan to fix it. We used data provided by departments ranging from soil type, topography and land use to rainfall and existing storm water drain network to create a mathematical model (a software), which can generate solutions for waterlogging for the whole city. We generated four solutions for different drains ‚Äî adjusting slope of the existing drain, diverting water to existing water bodies, using additional storages, and other development works. These solutions considered the rainfall, slope of the drain, and many other factors and were done with a bigger picture in mind to provide a comprehensive solution to the city, rather than isolated ones. The model is a dynamic one and can be used to even assess the impact even constructing new drains. The model will keep on giving solutions as you change the different parameters. That is the beauty of the model we have created. Rather than giving the work to a contractor without knowing the impact, the government can actually assess the impact of proposed changes.

The master plan was commissioned in 2012, but why did it get delayed?

The government was supposed to give us data of the drains and we were told that the data was digitised. But we were shocked when we saw the data. In the name of digitisation of drains, there was only a line showing that a drain was passing through an area. The size, depth, slope etc., which are needed for analysis, were not there. We immediately sought a meeting with the Chief Secretary and said that nothing could be done with this data. He understood the issue and directed 11 departments, under whose jurisdiction the drains fall, to provide us with data of the drains. These departments in turn engaged contractors to give the data.

What happened after that?

It took more than a year to get the data. But there were problems in that too. We kept on telling them that in many segments the data given to us showed that the drain was going up instead of down. We call them adverse slopes. A drain needs a gradual slope for water to flow through it of its own under gravity. So, an adverse slope means that either the data is wrong or the construction of the drain in that area is problematic. We kept on asking the departments to verify the data; some did it, but majority of them did not verify the data given to us. We even sent 900 students over the course of four-five years to observe the condition of the drains. They had clicked about 2,500 geo-tagged photos of the drains. These photos showed that the drains were full of muck, which went against the government‚Äôs claim of cleaning them.

When did you submit the report?

We submitted the draft report in December 2016 and then the departments kept correcting the data and we submitted it again in April 2017, May 2017, November 2017, and the final report was submitted in July 2018. We mentioned in the report also that the data was not verified by the departments. As part of the report, we gave them suggestions to divert water coming to the drains by digging rainwater harvesting pits in parks and diverting water to water bodies. We also told them that we could help them with how to remove silt in drains and verify it. These were things that could be done right away, but they didn‚Äôt do anything.

Was it implemented?

On August 1, 2018, we gave a presentation to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on the master plan. The CM asked different departments to implement the recommendations made in the report and we thought that the project was over from our side. But nothing happened after that. A technical expert committee was formed in 2012 to be involved with us from the beginning on the project, but it had never met with us. In 2019, suddenly, it met for the first time and it was decided that the departments should verify at least 10% of the data. Again, the departments were not responding and after a lot of pressure, in 2021, some departments said that of the 10% data, there was 50% error ‚Äî it took two years for this. Now we are disappointed and feeling very foolish that we decided to help the government. Many people will say that the project didn‚Äôt work because IIT didn‚Äôt do its job.

Can the master plan be implemented in the current form?

No, the study has to be reworked with validated data. The best way forward will be to identify the perpetually flooded areas and identify drainage networks belonging to those locations. The data of these networks should be verified on priority and the rest can be taken step by step. Since we have provided them the complete modelling framework, the government should close this phase and discuss the way forward as a separate project.

So, is the project over now?

No, the project is not concluded. After nine years, we haven‚Äôt been given even one third of the agreed payment. More than two months ago, we had written to the government to end the current project, but there has been no reply from them.",discussion,Delhi Flood,"Delhi, India",2012,2018,"West Delhi, East Delhi",50%,"Loss of property, livelihoods",0,"Traffic snarls, inconvenience to citizens",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

CPWD officials had, however, denied the allegations back in February. When Hindustan Times reached out to CPWD on Friday, officials refused to respond.

‚ÄúNearly 25 houses got flooded over the past two days. The situation has been aggravated by the mounds of mud and waste dumped there.

The Lakhwar Multipurpose Project is expected to provide 19.03 MCM (million cubic metres) of drinking water to Delhi, according to the project details on the environment ministry‚Äôs Parivesh website. It is also likely to provide irrigation on 33,780 hectares and water for domestic and industrial use ‚Äî 78.83 MCM to neighbouring states, including Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi.

Watch: First high dam on Yamuna raises environmental concerns





Over 50% of the land affected by the proposed project is forest land. Clearance was first issued to Lakhwar and Vyasi, which together make the Lakhwar Vyasi Multipurpose project, by the environment ministry in 1987. Work was started by UP‚Äôs department of irrigation and tunnels; an underground powerhouse was completed by 1992. After the formation of Uttarakhand, the project was handed over to NHPC and bifurcated into two parts -- Lakhwar MPP (300 MW) with Katapathar Barrage and Vyasi hydroelectric project (120MW).

After environmentalists moved the National Green Tribunal on the lack of environmental appraisal of the project, the tribunal on January 10, 2019 directed the expert appraisal committee to appraise the project afresh under the environment impact assessment notification 2006.

Dam authorities brushed aside the concerns raised by environmentalists.

‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs the biggest high dam on the Yamuna with the highest storage capacity. But all these fears are baseless. We have conducted very detailed studies on environmental implications. Also, locals are waiting desperately for the dam. It‚Äôs a major developmental project for this region,‚Äù said a senior official of the Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited who did not wish to be named.

Manoj Mishra, convener of the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan, said the Lakhwar dam is an ‚Äúinvitation to trouble‚Äù for Delhi. Located right on the Yamuna and being the first city downstream, the Capital will be the first to be impacted in case of anything going wrong with the dam.

‚ÄúUnlike cities such as Panipat, Sonepat, Karnal and Yamunanagar, which also fall along the route of the Yamuna, Delhi is right on the river. If the Lakhwar dam breaks or if there is any disaster there, Delhi has had it. The first to be submerged will be east Delhi and parts of south Delhi. Other cities are still a few kilometres away from the river, but Delhi will not even have the time to respond,‚Äù Mishra said.

The proposed height of the dam is 204 metres, which is as tall as a 70-metre building, and the impact of water gushing from such a height will be first faced by Delhi, he added.

Mishra said along with facing the risk of a possible disaster, Delhi could also be water starved. During monsoon rains currently, the Yamuna and its aquifers get rejuvenated because there is nothing holding the river back upstream. Since such big dams primarily hold monsoon water, Delhi will be drastically starved of Yamuna‚Äôs water.

The Delhi Jal Board‚Äôs documents show that the Capital currently gets 50 gallons per person per day, which is nearly 200 litres per person per day, much higher than the average in other cities. Delhi‚Äôs requirement is around 100 litres per person per day, according to experts. The DJB‚Äôs water management plans are also centred on making the city self-sufficient in its water needs.

‚ÄúCompared to the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi the sediment load and volumes are much lower in the Yamuna and this dam is quite downstream. It is also fed by a number of glaciers. We have to see what kinds of checks they have against flooding or disasters,‚Äù said Navin Juyal, a retired geologist from the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad.

Residents of Lohari village along the Yamuna are both happy that the project may finally take off after over 30 years and the locals may benefit from compensation, rehabilitation and jobs but they are also anxious about what this could mean for the river. ‚ÄúWe are very happy that the dam is coming. This is because it will bring livelihood opportunities to us. There are so many young boys here who have no jobs. Residents have been waiting for the project to take off for over 30 years now. We were children then,‚Äù said Ramesh Chauhan, a resident of Lohari. At the same time, the Yamuna is of enormous spiritual and religious significance to people here.

‚ÄúThe Yamuna is our mother. Our life is linked to the river. Whenever water levels have risen, we have prayed to the Yamuna and she has saved us from disaster. Even in 2013, during the floods, water levels had risen dangerously, so we went to the temple on the Yamuna banks and prayed for hours. All the villagers were there. We believe that we were saved from being washed away because of our faith in the river,‚Äù said Tikam Singh, another resident.

One of the risks associated with dams is a break that may result in a flood wave up to tens of metres high, travelling along a valley at high speeds.

The impact of such a wave on developed areas can be sufficient to completely destroy infrastructure, according to documents on the Parivesh website.

delhi,2021,https://reliefweb.int/report/india/action-plan-prevent-floods,10-Dec-21,Action Plan to Prevent Floods - India,"Posted On: 09 DEC 2021 5:24PM by PIB Delhi Floods are natural calamity that the country faces almost every year, in varying degrees of magnitude. The occurrence of floods can be attributed to various factors, including wide variations in rainfall both in time and space with frequent departures from the normal pattern, inadequate carrying capacities of rivers, river bank erosion and silting of river beds, landslides, poor natural drainage in flood prone areas, snowmelt and glacial lake out-bursts. Central Water Commission compiles flood damage data on the basis of information received from States. As per the data of last 20 years, no trend is perceived in the economic loss because of floods in the State of Assam. Maximum loss occurred in economic term was Rs 4164.81 Cr in year 2017. Statement showing flood damages during last twenty years in State of Assam is given at Annexure-I.

Flood management comes under the purview of the States; the schemes for flood control and erosion control are formulated and implemented by concerned States as per their priority. The Union Government supplements the efforts of the States by providing technical guidance and promotional financial assistance for management of floods in critical areas. During XI Plan, Government of India had launched Flood Management Programme (FMP) for providing central assistance to States for works related to flood management and erosion control, etc. with an outlay of Rs 8,000 Cr which continued during XII Plan with an outlay of Rs 10,000 Cr. Financial assistance was also provided to the States/UTs for undertaking flood management works project under the scheme ‚ÄúRiver Management Activities and Works related to Border Areas‚Äù during XII Plan. The ‚ÄúFlood Management Programme (FMP)‚Äù and ‚ÄúRiver Management Activities & Works related to Border Areas (RMBA)‚Äù under operation during XII Five Year Plan were merged as ‚ÄúFlood Management and Border Areas Programme (FMBAP)‚Äù for the period 2017-18 to 2019-20 and further extended upto March, 2021.

In Assam, a total 141 projects costing Rs 2383.11 Cr were approved during XI Plan and XII Plan. A Central Assistance of Rs 748.86 Cr was released during XI Plan and Rs. 64.89 Cr during XII Plan. Further, a Central Assistance of Rs 245.49 Cr was released to Assam during year 2017-18, Rs 142.12 Cr in the year 2018-19 and Rs 85.03 Croes in the year 2019-20. Thus, since start of XI Plan, total Central Assistance released to the state of Assam is Rs 1286.39 Cr. Out of these 141 projects, 105 projects have been completed which has given reasonable protection to an area of 6.7 Lakh ha and protected a population of 160.63 lakh.

But now, it is synonymous with another Chennai image: Roads that turn into rivers, boats for vehicles, and people stranded in homes at the first hint of heavy rainfall.

When Chennai received over 900mm excess rainfall in November, the roads of T Nagar, and indeed other parts of Chennai, were completely submerged. It was the second highest rainfall recorded in the city in November since 2015, when it suffered massive floods.

In November 2015, Chennai received 1,049mm of rain, compared with 915mm of rainfall till November 29 this year. There have been particularly heavy rains between November 6 and 7 (210 mm), November 10 (22mm), November 19 (32mm), and November 26 (29mm). Overall, Tamil Nadu and the neighbouring Union territory of Puducherry together received 630mm of rainfall from October 1to November 29 as against the average for these months of 350mm. ‚ÄúDuring the same time period the rainfall received in Chennai is 1,130mm, which is 83% higher than the average,‚Äù said V Puviarasan, deputy director of the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Chennai.

Across the state, 72 people were killed in rain-related incidents, 15,164 people were evacuated from low-lying areas and accommodated in 182 relief camps, and crops spread over 50,000 hectares were damaged.

Low flood limit

In the 2015 tragedy, more than 400 people lost their lives across the state. The situation was compounded when water from the Chembarambakkam lake was released, flooding Chennai. Since then, the Tamil Nadu government has said that a ‚Çπ5,000 crore integrated stormwater project is being implemented, and in T Nagar alone, ‚Çπ9.3 crore has been spent on a drain under the ‚Äúsmart city‚Äù mission, and was completed in 2020.

This expenditure includes work to construct collector, feeder and arterial drains, canals for the Adyar and Cooum basins, which were completed last year, and ongoing work for canals for the Kosasthalaiyar basin in northern Chennai and Kovalam in the south. And yet, Chennai floods.

The first reason is Chennai‚Äôs long history of vanishing lakes and water bodies, captured by rampant and unfettered urbanisation. Only 15% of Chennai‚Äôs wetlands are left, according to a study by Chennai-based Care Earth Trust, a biodiversity research organisation. Their findings show that Chennai‚Äôs built-up area grew from 47 sq. km in 1980 to 402 sq. km in 2012, while wetlands declined from 186 sq. km to 71 sq. km.

Between 2017 and 2018, about 48km of drains were built under the smart cities mission. Wherever these new drains have been laid, there was little to no flooding, said an official of Greater Chennai Corporation. ‚ÄúPlaces like T Nagar flood all the time mostly because there are old drains, which we are looking to reconstruct,‚Äù he said, requesting anonymity.

In T Nagar, particularly, there was another problem. Contractors engaged in improvement work for the Mambalam canal, where all the water from T Nagar drains, had dumped debris all along a length of 1.7km that blocked inlets.

An indication that the drains in the city failed to work during this monsoon comes from the overburdening of another department, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, which manages the city‚Äôs water supply and sewage network.

‚ÄúWe usually pump out 585 mld (million litres per daily) of sewage everyday, which reaches the treatment plants, but since heavy rains began, we are pumping out 920 mld,‚Äù an official from the department said, but declined to be named. ‚ÄúThe additional load is because the corporation is using heavy motors to drain rainwater from waterlogged streets into the sewerage pipes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe also stop our system for about four to five hours every night for maintenance,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut this entire month, the pumping system and treatment plants have been functioning 24x7.‚Äù

According to municipality records, there are more than 30,000 interior roads and 471 bus route roads in Chennai that add up to close to 5,000km and 300km, respectively, but the city‚Äôs drainage network is present in just around 2,000km. Many of these drains were built at least three decades ago.

‚ÄúThe old drains were constructed for a rainfall capacity of 20mm per hour, whereas the new drains are being built for 70mm per hour. The old drains are built of brick and mortar so they are dilapidated and break easily,‚Äù said the municipality official cited above said.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have the capacity to withstand the kind of rains we have received this year,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have been using reinforced concrete for the new drains since 2015.‚Äù

Many areas in the city were flooded although they had roads with drains on both sides, found a field audit by Chennai-based Arappor Iyakkam, an anti-corruption NGO.

‚ÄúWhy are they spending crores of money to build these drains which aren‚Äôt working? They may as well spend less to buy pumps to drain water via sewage pipes, which is what they have been doing every monsoon,‚Äù said Jayaram Venkatesan, convener of Arappor Iyakkam.

Corruption in awarding tenders as well as improper design where the drain slope is higher than the height of the road or the gradient not matching the water body to which it is linked are primary problems, Venkatesan said.

After years of demands by activists and environmentalists, the municipal corporation his week began releasing maps on its website on where drains are located, a crucial information gap till now. ‚ÄúOnly with these maps will we be able to understand where the drains are present, how they are connected and in which direction they drain,‚Äù said Venkatesan.

These maps show, for instance, a ward in T Nagar where the height of a manhole on the street is at 5m but the drain is at a height of 5.7m, impeding the flow of water, said Raj Bhagat, senior manager of Geoanalytics at research organisation World Resources Institute India, who is studying these maps.

There has also been no way of verifying if these drains have been designed in tune with the rate of rainfall, he said. ‚ÄúEven if the drain is designed for a particular rainfall rate, it is connected to another drain so the second drain has to have more capacity as well because it accumulates water from both streets,‚Äù Bhagat said.

The city‚Äôs drainage network is designed only to carry average rainfall, and that it cannot handle excess rainfall, according to KP Subramanian, former professor of urban engineering at Chennai‚Äôs Anna University. ‚ÄúAnd it gets clogged further with solid waste and drain slits that are not cleaned regularly.‚Äù

There is also a clear lack of coordination between various civic departments ranging from the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, which approves building constructions, the public works department that is in charge of de-silting water bodies, the municipal corporation which builds drains and Metro Water that lays pipelines under roads for water and sewage connections.

‚ÄúWe have a common problem where the corporation lays a new bitumen road and almost immediately it is dug up by other state agencies such as the Metro Water, electricity board, telephone and internet providers to lay utility cables underground,‚Äù a government official said on condition of anonymity. ‚ÄúSimilarly, in some places, Metro Water pipelines run perpendicular to the drains underground, which reduces the capacity of the drains.‚Äù

Moving forward

Based on the November rains, municipal authorities have identified pockets where drainage capacity has to be augmented, said GCC commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi, who took over the civic body in May.

He also said drain construction will now follow prescribed standards. ‚ÄúThe World Bank‚Äôs standard, for example, is for bigger drains to take 70mm of rainfall per hour. But if we receive 100mm rainfall and that has to be taken care of, the stormwater drains will be bigger and the roads will become smaller,‚Äù Bedi said. ‚ÄúDrains are constructed for optimum rainfall and not heavy rainfall because there has to be a balance between the road width and the drain.‚Äù

Given this tenuous balance, Bedi said the corporation was looking at ways to bolster drainage even if there is stagnant water, like permanent pumps. ‚ÄúWe are looking at how fast we can drain out the water even if it stagnates. As the city expands, many drains‚Äô capacity has to be increased. And it‚Äôs not just the case in Chennai. It is the same for Bengaluru or Mumbai,‚Äù he said.

Another peculiar issue that GCC engineers identified during these rains were so-called saucer-type streets, where the constant relaying of roads resulted in them being at a higher level than homes in densely populated areas. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt put up drains in these places so we have decided to have permanent pumps there too,‚Äù said Bedi.

Ironically, another conundrum that the city faces is a drought-like situation a few months after the northeast monsoon, which experts say can be addressed if the urban run-off is stored. Water from drains should be diverted to existing water bodies, particularly those located outside Chennai, which will help in mitigating flooding as well as recharging aquifers, experts said.

‚ÄúWe thought they would learn lessons from the 2015 floods, but they haven‚Äôt,‚Äù said Sekhar Raghavan, director of the city based Rain Centre, a non-profit. ‚ÄúYou cannot build a stormwater drain over a lake or a pond and let that water go into the sea. Drains work only in specific locations.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe government needs to look into the potential of water bodies, protect, reclaim and rejuvenate them,‚Äù Raghavan said. ‚ÄúThis will rescue flooding and, if these water bodies can be made into recharge ponds and reservoirs, the local community can use it for their water needs.‚Äù

All said, the city will continue to flood, former corporation officials said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a complex issue. One, we have geographical disadvantages of being a flat city close to sea level. And since for more than 70 years, we have encroached on all the natural water bodies,‚Äù a former official said, asking not to be named. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a collective failure of officials, real estate and civil society.‚Äù

delhi,2021,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148397/greater-delhi,05-Jun-21,Greater Delhi,"An astronaut aboard the International Space Station (ISS) focused a camera lens on Delhi, the capital city and center of the largest urban region in India and fifth largest in the world. Including the surrounding metropolitan areas, the population of Delhi in 2021 surpassed 31 million people.

The conurbation now links the surrounding cities of Ghaziabad, Greater Noida, Faridabad, and Gurgaon; collectively, this urbanized area stretches for 70 kilometers (45 miles) along the Yamuna River. These cityscapes display the typical light-toned grays of building materials in the region.

The government center, New Delhi, is an inner sector of Delhi that hosts India‚Äôs parliament, ministries, and presidential palace. An abundance of trees and parks makes New Delhi appear as a darker-toned region straddling the Yamuna River. This part of Delhi also houses national sports stadiums and major cultural buildings, such as the Hindu Akshardham Temple. It is home to the Jama Masjid, one of the largest mosques in India; it was completed in 1656 during the period of the Mughal Empire.

Smaller cities surrounding the urban region include Panipat, Rohtak, Rewari, and Mathura west of the river and Meerut and Aligarh on the east side. The cities are, in turn, surrounded by hundreds of small towns and villages, which show up as small gray dots scattered across the view. The rust color south of the metro region is due to reddish rocks that appear at the land surface.

A short reach of the Ganga River (Ganges) appears at the top right. The width of the Ganga is greater than that of the Yamuna, indicating its larger flow and wider channel. These rivers drain water from the Himalaya Mountains, and both are critical to the water supply of the Delhi region. Water from the Ganga is led along the Upper Ganga Canal, which was built in the 1800s to bring water to the city and the rich farmland of the surrounding plains.

Delhi‚Äôs large footprint also stands out in nighttime photos taken by ISS astronauts in August 2020 and August 2011.

Astronaut photograph ISS064-E-37008 was acquired on February 23, 2021, with a Nikon D5 digital camera using a focal length of 78 millimeters. It is provided by the ISS Crew Earth Observations Facility and the Earth Science and Remote Sensing Unit, Johnson Space Center. The image was taken by a member of the Expedition 64 crew. The image has been cropped and enhanced to improve contrast, and lens artifacts have been removed. The International Space Station Program supports the laboratory as part of the ISS National Lab to help astronauts take pictures of Earth that will be of the greatest value to scientists and the public, and to make those images freely available on the Internet.

Traffic snarls were reported as buses were stuck in areas like Moti Bagh, RK Puram, Jorbagh and Madhu Vihar where roads were waterlogged due to hours-long rainfall. The India Meteorological Department, meanwhile, has predicted ‚Äòmoderate to heavy intensity rain‚Äô at many places of Delhi‚Äô on Saturday.

The southwest monsoon in Delhi may have been erratic and one of the most delayed this season, but it has given the highest rainfall to the national capital in 11 years ‚Äî 1,005.3 mm so far. This is the first time since 2010 that monsoon rainfall in Delhi breached the 1,000 mm mark. Normally, the Safdarjung Observatory, which is considered as the official marker for the city, records 648.9 mm of rainfall during the monsoon season on average, according to India Meteorological Department data. Between June 1, when the monsoon season starts, and September 10, it gets 586.4mm of rainfall.

While the rains lashed the capital and caused water-logging, it also lead to a downpour of memes on Twitter.

Journalist Meenakshi Joshi was among many users who shared the video on Twitter Wednesday. The tweet in Hindi, which has since been deleted, read: ‚ÄúBuses, auto-rickshaws and cars are queens of the water during Delhi rains‚Äù.

New Delhi: A 30-second video of water flooding ‚Äúa bus in Delhi‚Äù and two photographs of the waterlogged road under the Minto Bridge in the capital went viral on social media Wednesday as heavy rains lashed Delhi.

BJP spokesperson Gaurav Goel tweeted a photograph of waterlogging under the Minto Bridge at Connaught Place, New Delhi, in which he referred to submerged buses as ‚Äúsubmarines‚Äù. The post had been shared nearly 400 times at the time of publishing this report.

The corner of the photo features a billboard of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal next to a caption in Hindi that reads: ‚ÄúDid you get water supply in your house today?‚Äù. Goel captioned the tweet with a hashtag, ‚Äú#AdManKejriwal‚Äù.

Varun Puri, Member, Advisory Committee, Indian Council for Cultural Relations at the Ministry of External Affairs, shared a different photograph of submerged buses under the Minto Bridge with the same hashtag. It had been shared over 160 times at the time of publishing this report.

Fact check

The video, claiming to have been shot in the capital, is originally from Jaipur, while the two Minto Bridge photographs were taken almost four years ago.

In August 2020, Abhishek Dutt, vice president, Delhi Congress, had posted the same video and attributed it to the national capital.

The video of water entering a bus is not from the national capital but rather Jaipur, Rajasthan. It was one of the many videos shared by netizens as the city was lashed with floods in August 2020. Three persons died during the floods.

A Patrika news report dated 11 August 2020 and a video shared on YouTube by Hindi news channel Khaskhabar confirm that the visuals were shot in Jaipur last year.

The photograph of submerged buses under Minto Bridge, shared by Goel, first appeared in 2018 when heavy rains lashed several parts of the city. The image was also used in a Deccan Herald report dated 13 July 2018. The photo shared by Goel was also found to be edited as the original image did not feature any billboard.

The picture shared by Puri of submerged buses was also an edited one. On the left side of the photo is a sticker of a cartoon face with the words: ‚ÄúTroll F*ckers‚Äù. The original photo is from floods in Delhi during July 2020.

Tuesday, July 20 : With the most delayed arrival of monsoon in 19 years on July 13, Delhi witnessed bountiful rains this week. In 42 days from June 1 to July 12, the national capital had recorded only 44 mm rainfall, marking a 67% rainfall deficit. However, post the monsoon onset, Delhi has registered more than 150 mm in eight days, taking the total seasonal rainfall figures beyond the long-period average of 200 mm.

Over the last 24 hours till Tuesday morning, most parts of Delhi witnessed heavy rains of more than 60 mm, with Palam recording a maximum of 67 mm. A cyclonic circulation lying over the boundary of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana has continued to induce widespread rain with localised heavy falls across the Indo-Gangetic Plains, including Delhi-NCR.

As per the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts, the present spell of heavy rains will likely continue on Tuesday and subside from Wednesday onwards. Accordingly, The entire subdivision of Delhi, Haryana and Chandigarh is under an ‚Äòorange alert‚Äô for Tuesday, which recommends residents ‚Äòbe prepared‚Äô for adverse weather conditions. No alerts are there over Delhi-NCR for Wednesday and Thursday.

On Friday, July 23, a low-pressure area is likely to develop over the Bay of Bengal. Subsequently, due to the strengthening of easterly winds, rain and thunderstorms are likely to return across northern plains, including Delhi. Therefore, the regional met centre has placed a ‚Äòyellow warning‚Äô over the entire city of Delhi for Friday, urging residents to ‚Äòbe updated‚Äô.

Advertisement However, despite a drop in rainfall intensity, Delhi is expected to remain generally cloudy with intermittent light rain or drizzles this week. Daytime temperatures are expected to stay below 35¬∞C till the weekend.

Over the past eight days, while the rains brought respite from the summer heat, they also disrupted the daily life of residents in many parts of the capital. The incessant downpour led to waterlogging at hundreds of road stretches and localities, thereby creating traffic snarls.

Last year, Delhi welcomed monsoon rains on June 25 and received 467 mm rainfall until September, 20% less than the long-term average rainfall. However, long-range forecasts suggest that Delhi‚Äôs monsoon rainfall figures this year could be higher than last year despite a late-onset. The long-period average rainfall for Delhi is 586 mm. The TWC forecast indicates that the national capital will witness an above-normal July, followed by a drier August and a wetter September this year.

While large-scale flooding displaced thousands of people in Assam, Bihar and some parts of West Bengal, landslides triggered by heavy rain continued to wreak havoc in parts of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.

The ministry‚Äôs report on the flood situation said that 22 districts of Assam, 36 of Bihar, 12 of Uttar Pradesh and two each of West Bengal and Jharkhand were affected due to rise in water level in several rivers, including Ganga, Kosi, Bhagmati, Gandak, Ghagra and Mahananda. About 1.5 million people in these states have been affected due to the floods in the past 48 hours alone, the report added.

Data released by the disaster management departments of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand said the two states recorded more landslides this year when compared to previous years, even though rainfall has been less. Although rainfall in Uttarakhand was deficient by around 5% this year, the state saw a 32% increase in landslides, as per data from the state public works department.

Over 135 people have been killed in over 1,200 incidents such as landslides and boulder falls, or were washed away in swollen rivers this year.

Himachal, which saw 9% less rainfall, reported a 60% increase in landslides this year, according to the state disaster management authority. About 150 deaths were reported from the state so far this rainy season.

Assam is witnessing floods despite less than normal rainfall. ‚ÄúFor the month of August, the state received 296.3 mm rainfall against the normal of 347.1mm,‚Äù Sumit Das, senior scientist at Guwahati-based regional meteorological office, said.

In the past seven days till August 31, the average rainfall for the state was recorded at 70.7 mm -- 4% less than the normal of 73.2 mm.

Till August-end, Bihar received 801.9 mm of rain as compared to the normal of 1,027 mm, even as 32 of the total 40 districts remained flooded, displacing over a million people.

While half of Odisha is witnessing drought-like conditions, the two neighbouring states of West Bengal and Jharkhand recorded flooding in some districts. Both Bengal and Jharkhand have received up to 8% excess rain, which is considered normal. Burdwan district in Bengal received around 40% more rain above the climatic normal in the entire season. Last week, Cooch Behar received 136% excess rain while North Dinajpur received 98% excess rain. In Jharkhand, Ranchi and its neighbouring districts received 20% excess rainfall this monsoon.

Maharashtra, which has seen very high rainfall in the past two months, witnessed excess rainfall in 16 districts, including Mumbai and Nashik. The rainfall is up to 371% higher than normal for this period, according to IMD‚Äôs local weather office.

Extremely heavy rainfall in the last two months which led to high-intensity floods and landslides resulted in the deaths of nearly 300 people and displaced over 450,000 people across the state, officials familiar with the matter said. A relief and rehabilitation department official said ‚ÄúAs per data from early August, floods and landslides affected more than 1,100 villages in the districts of Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Sangli, Kolhapur and Satara.‚Äù

While the western and some parts of northeastern Madhya Pradesh received heavy rainfall in the past two days, there has been no flood-like situation in the state, officials said. Fifteen districts -- four in Bundelkhand, five in Mahakaushal, two in the central region and four in Malwa -- are in the orange zone, officials said.

The state has recorded 720.8mm rainfall so far while it received 254mm rainfall in August alone, officials said, adding that there has been an overall rainfall deficiency of 7% this year.

In the next few days, above normal rainfall activity is likely over many parts of central India and normal to below normal rainfall over many areas of northwest, northeast and southern most parts of peninsular India. With the IMD predicting above-normal rainfall in September, the current rain deficiency of 9% over the country is likely to decrease and hence, the overall monsoon rain (June 1 to September 30) is likely to be in the ‚Äúlower end of normal category‚Äù.

Despite having more dry days than previous years, extreme rainfall in the month of August increased this year in some states, the weather body said.

‚ÄúThere was good rainfall in the morning. Water-logging was reported on several arterial roads, slowing down the traffic movement. We ensured that additional traffic policemen were deployed to assist and direct traffic,‚Äù said a senior traffic police official asking not to be named.

Flooding was reported from the Pul Prahladpur underpass, near the Mehrauli-Badarpur Road. forcing the public works department (PWD) to stop traffic movement for some time.

‚ÄúAs a precautionary measure, we had to stop traffic for about two hours due to heavy water-logging at the Pul Prahladpur underpass. It was caused due to the overflow of a DJB (Delhi Jal Board) sewer line,‚Äù a PWD official said.

However, there was no water-logging reported at the Minto Road rail underpass, a spot that gets flooded during the rains every year --- often providing an iconic and customary photograph of a blood submerged in water. PWD officials said elaborate arrangements were made to avoid water accumulation under the bridge.

People posted pictures and videos of water-logged streets on social media, blaming the authorities for the annual problem.

Shalini Gupta, a resident of Saket, said every year colony roads get submerged. ‚ÄúThe claims made by civic agencies that they have cleaned the drains and ensured proper outflow of stormwater fall flat every year. Some accountability must be fixed,‚Äù said Gupta.

South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) mayor Mukesh Suryan said, ‚ÄúWe have cleaned all drains under our jurisdiction. It is the bigger drains falling under the jurisdiction of the Delhi government departments including PWD and the Irrigation and Flood Control (I&FC) that are choked. Since the smaller drains fall into the bigger drains, the overflowing sewer water flows back and floods residential areas,‚Äù he said.

Senior PWD officials rejected claims by the municipalities. They said since the corporations do not remove solid waste properly, it chokes the storm water drains despite being cleaned. ‚ÄúWe have completed our desilting process on time. Tonnes of solid waste is dumped in drains, which chokes them and cause water-logging on the roads,‚Äù the official said.

Heavy rains on Tuesday morning led to extensive waterlogging on several road stretches across Delhi, including near Pragati Maidan in central and Dhaula Kuan in the southern part of the city. Some of the stretches and areas where waterlogging was seen included Dhaula Kuan, Mathura Road, Moti Bagh, Vikas Marg, Ring Road, Rohtak Road, Sangam Vihar, Kirari and near Pragati Maidan among others. The waterlogging also created traffic snarls in different locations of the city.

Traffic moved at a slow pace at ITO, underneath Moti Bagh metro station, Dhaula Kuan underpass, near Pragati Maidan, Mathura Road, Vikas Marg, Ring Road near IP Flyover, Rohtak Road among others. Public Works Department (PWD) officials said waterlogging complaints were being dealt with priority.

‚ÄúMorning rain was of high intensity so a few areas of the city witnessed waterlogging. Our field staff is on the ground and we are closely observing the situation,‚Äù a PWD official said.

According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), the Southwest Monsoon had reached the capital on July 13, which was 16 days behind the usual date of onset.

Normally, monsoon reaches Delhi by June 27. It covers the entire country by July 8. Last year, the wind system had reached Delhi on June 25 and covered the entire country by June 29.

The minimum temperature recorded at Safdarjung Observatory, considered the official reading of the city, was 25 degrees Celsius, two notches below the normal, the IMD said on Tuesday.

It said 100 mm of rainfall was recorded at Safdarjung Observatory in the past last 24 hours. The relative humidity recorded at 8.30 am in the city was 100 percent, the IMD said.

The weatherman has predicted a generally cloudy sky with moderate rain and the possibility of thundershowers accompanied by gusty winds carrying a speed of 30-40 kmph later in the day.

The maximum temperature in the national capital is likely to hover around 30 degrees Celsius.

Why do Indian cities drown every rainy season? Why does a generally dry National Capital Region (NCR), which includes Delhi and its neighbouring areas, that gets a fraction of rain compared to Mumbai and Chennai flood so easily?

Experts point to no or poor town planning that does not take into account the topography or the local weather and the absence of a robust drainage system.

‚ÄúLack of planning is the root cause of urban problems. In town planning, we have to take into account the natural topography, water bodies, rainfall data and the water channels,‚Äù said PK Sarkar, an urban affairs expert and a retired professor of Delhi‚Äôs School of Planning and Architecture.

A good drainage system should be central to any city‚Äôs planning but it hardly gets attention. ‚ÄúWater bodies are equally important because they act as natural holders of rain,‚Äù Sarkar said.

Vanishing water bodies and channels, which hold rainwater, choked storm-water drains and concretisation were responsible for waterlogging that plagues Delhi and other cities.

Sinking in the rain

Waterlogging is common in Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, and Guwahati as these cities get heavy monsoon rain. Delhi and Gurugram, however, get less rain. Delhi‚Äôs annual rainfall averages about 617 mm and Gurugram‚Äôs 714 mm compared to Mumbai‚Äôs 2,514 mm.

The capital needs to get a fix on its drainage system, say experts.

Delhi has about 2,846 drains running into 3,692 km, a chunk of which is managed by the public works department, government data shows. Many smaller drains are the responsibility of the three municipal corporations.

The city has three major natural drainage basins‚ÄîTrans Yamuna, Barapullah and Najafgarh, apart from some small basins. Najafgarh is connected to Gurugram.

Delhi‚Äôs drainage system was laid out by the British. In 2016, IIT-Delhi was asked to study the system. Its suggestions are yet to be implemented. (Water colours: Santanu Kumar Santan)

The Delhi government says it will bolster the drainage system‚Äîit better and fast as an overhaul is long overdue.

‚ÄúIn Delhi, the British had laid out the drainage system. After that, hardly any proper thought has been given till now to revamp and redesign the drain network in the light of the prevailing conditions. That‚Äôs why the city gets flooded in no time every monsoon,‚Äù Sarkar said.

Delhi‚Äôs last drainage master plan was drafted in 1976 when the city was governed by a metropolitan council. In 2016, the Delhi government asked Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi to study the city‚Äôs drainage system.

Let it flow

Based on the study, a drainage master plan was drawn, which said Delhi had no single agency to oversee the drainage system. The plan is yet to be implemented.

Design changes would be made to drains based on IIT‚Äôs suggestions for better discharge of water during heavy rain, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on August 24.

‚ÄúThe city‚Äôs waterlogging problem will be solved,"" the CM‚Äôs Office tweeted.

There is a need to map areas based on waterlogging and rainfall and come up with local solutions such as embankments, drains and check dams.

‚ÄúWe should map rainfall and flood data, see under what conditions a city is likely to face problems and design accordingly. In low-lying areas, the authorities can develop a simulation model and see how it works,‚Äù Sarkar said.

‚ÄúWe need a comprehensive perception with respect to green city, greenfield and brownfield projects.‚Äù While carrying out developmental works, modern ways to build a drainage system should given a priority before building roads, Sarkar said.

Band-aids wouldn‚Äôt cut it

Not just Delhi, Gurugram, too, needs to allocate substantial amount of funds to improve the drainage system, say experts.

Gurugram‚Äôs problems largely stem from the plunder of its natural water bodies. Several of its lakes and ponds have been built over‚Äîhigh-rises, condos and glass-facade offices, which are in an ecological disaster on their own, have damaged the natural ecosystem and obstructed the flow of rainwater.

Lathika Thukral of ‚ÄúI am Gurgaon‚Äù said it was time to end the band-aid and disaster-management approach and look for long-term solutions.

‚ÄúI am Gurgaon‚Äù is a citizen‚Äôs initiative to restore the city‚Äôs green habitat.

‚ÄúThere is a need to channelise the water flow. The jheels (lakes), water bodies and low areas are filled up (with) construction. We need plans to save and revive them,‚Äù Thukral said.

From 640 in 1956, the number of water bodies in Gurugram shrunk to about 251 in 2018-19, records show.

‚ÄúThe drains are anyway filled with sewer water. So when it rains, they overflow. Storm-water drains should be for stormwater only, not sewer water,‚Äù she said.

Storm drains, she said, cannot take all the pressure during rains. ‚ÄúWe need ways to hold water where it stays, for example, water bodies,‚Äù Thukral said.

Sarkar agrees. ‚ÄúWhat we have here in the name of city planning is roads and construction based on the land. Most cities lack a proper drainage system. We have filled up the nallahs and water bodies. So how will the water flow? The result is there for all to see. A little rain leads to chaos.‚Äù

On July 28, 2016, Gurugram got just 52mm of rain but it was enough to bring the city to a standstill for more than 20 hours.

People walked for hours and some even spent the night in their vehicles stuck in a giant jam. Shaken up, the authorities decided to widen the city‚Äôs arterial Badshahpur drain, which carries nearly 60-70 percent of Gurugram‚Äôs rainwater.

Concretisation of the drain had reduced its width, causing the rainwater to overflow.

Another drain was planned to ease the burden and a new agency proposed to end the confusion arising out of multiplicity of agencies. But apart from widening of the drain, which, too, was delayed due to litigation over land, not much has changed.

Pradeep Kumar, Chief Engineer, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), however, said things were better.

‚ÄúThe rainfall pattern is changing. Earlier, rain was scattered throughout the monsoon. We now get intense spells of 100mm rain in three hours, putting immense pressure on the infrastructure but our interventions have helped,‚Äù Kumar said

On July 19, when the city got 185 mm of rain, 90 percent of the affected areas were cleared quickly, he said. The authority has identified 75 critical waterlogging spots. In eight of those, it took more than two hours for the rainwater to drain. The rest were cleared in less than two hours, he said.

The authority is planning a ‚Äúmaster road‚Äù and a 150-km ‚Äúmaster drain‚Äù that should check waterlogging to a great extent, he said. ‚ÄúOne by one, we are resolving the issues,‚Äù Kumar said.

A government official added a note of caution. The earlier projections were based on flooding occurring twice a year but changing weather would need an increased drain capacity and reconstruction at some places, the official said on condition of anonymity.

A well-thought urbanisation plan that takes into account changing weather patterns is what Indian cities desperately need, until then it is rain, rain go away.

The study was released on Tuesday, a week before the start of a United Nations climate conference, known as COP26, in Glasgow, where developing countries such as India are expected to demand ramping up of climate finance to help them adapt to climate change.

Rich countries have failed to deliver on their promise of $100 billion every year by 2020, according to a UN report released on Monday.

The developed world has now shifted the deadline to meet the promise to 2023, blaming Covid-19 induced economic slowdown, according to a Reuters report quoting a meeting of finance ministers of G20 countries.

‚ÄúCombating the rising frequency and scale of extreme climate events is fiscally draining for developing countries such as India. At COP26, developed countries must regain trust by delivering the $100 billion promised in 2009 and commit to stepping up climate finance over the coming decade,‚Äù said Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive officer of Council for Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a New Delhi-based think tank that conducted the study.

Enhanced climate finance can also support India-led global agencies such as the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) to further mainstream climate actions and adaption, Ghosh said.

The study found that Dhemaji and Nagaon in Assam, Khammam in Telangana, Gajapati in Odisha, Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh, Sangli in Maharashtra, and Chennai in Tamil Nadu were among India‚Äôs most climate crisis vulnerable districts. The study also found that districts in the hill states of Uttarakhand, where 72 people had died in extreme rainfall events in mid October, and Himachal Pradesh, which has seen a 30% increase in extreme rainfall events this year till August, were more vulnerable than ever to climate crisis induced extreme rainfall events.

Further, 59% and 41% of the total districts in the eastern and western states, respectively, are highly vulnerable to severe cyclones, the study said.

Only 63% of districts have a District Disaster Management Plan (DDMP) and only 32% of them had updated the plans till 2019, the study found.

‚ÄúOur analysis suggests that India‚Äôs western and central zones are more vulnerable to drought-like conditions and their compounding impacts. The northern and north-eastern zones are more vulnerable to extreme flood events and their compounding impacts. India‚Äôs eastern and southern zones are highly vulnerable to extreme cyclonic events and their impacts and are also becoming extremely prone to cyclones, floods, and droughts combined,‚Äù said the study, titled Mapping India‚Äôs Climate Vulnerability: A District wise Assessment.

Three confirmed casualties in rain-related incidents have been confirmed so far, the official said, adding that two people were logged missing.

Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa said that he reviewed the rain-related situation in the state with the district commissioners. ""The state government will extend all necessary support to the relief and rescue efforts and assist farmers who suffered losses due to the untimely rain and hailstorms,"" the chief minister said in a tweet.

Yediyurappa also said that all the district in-charge ministers and MLAs have been asked to be present in their respective districts and constituencies to oversee rescue and relief efforts being carried out by the district administrations.

While the complete extent of damages from the floods in Karnataka is yet to be ascertained, government figures on Friday night indicated that as many as 21 houses in the deluge-hit districts have been destroyed completely, while at least 804 more residences took a partial hit due to the heavy rain. Landslides were reported in eight places, including Virajpet in the Kodagu district and Arabail Ghat in the Uttara Kannada district.

Moreover, Yamuna river‚Äôs water level also rose after 20,485 cusecs of water was released from Haryana‚Äôs Hathini Kund Barrage at 6 am on Friday. Further, 20,485 cusecs was again released at 7 am, while 19,056 cusecs was released at 8 am. Given the speed with which the water level of Yamuna is rising, it is believed that there may be floods in the low-lying areas around the Yamuna. The Delhi administration has issued an alert in the low-lying areas near the river's submergence area and the situation is being monitored round the clock.

The Delhi Police and the East Delhi district administration have started evacuating people living on the floodplains of the Yamuna as Haryana continues to discharging more water into the river from the Hathnikund Barrage.

Normally, the flow rate at the Hathnikund barrage is 352 cusec, but the discharge is increased after heavy rainfall in catchment areas.

One cusec is equivalent to 28.32 litres per second.

In 1978, the Yamuna river had swelled to the all-time record water level of 207.49 meters. In 2013, it had risen to 207.32 metres.

Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday predicted thunderstorms with light to moderate intensity rain over some parts of Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan during the next two hours.

""Thunderstorm with light to moderate intensity rain would occur over and adjoining areas of isolated places South, Southwest Delhi, Hissar, Narwana, Fatehabad, Adampur, Mahendergarh, Charkhidadri, Narnaul, Kosli, Tosham, Mehem, Hansi, Bhiwani (Haryana),"" IMD said in its tweet at 8 am.

Every year, thousands of people die in India from flooding and landslides during the monsoon season, which drenches the country from June to September.

The monsoon is a natural weather phenomenon caused by warm, moist air moving across the Indian Ocean toward South Asia as the seasons change. But the climate crisis has caused the event to become more extreme and unpredictable.

India‚Äôs poor, like Yadav, are among the most vulnerable.

‚ÄúThe irony of it is that the poor of the world are actually victims of climate change,‚Äù even if they aren‚Äôt the ones who ‚Äúcreated the problem,‚Äù said Sunita Narain, director general of the Centre for Science and Environment and veteran Indian environmentalist.

This weekend, world leaders are gathering in Glasgow for the COP26 climate talks as they seek to reduce carbon emissions and avoid a catastrophic rise in global temperatures.

Yet for millions of Indians, pledges on paper won‚Äôt save their homes. The climate crisis is already at their front door ‚Äì and it‚Äôs knocking down the frame.

Four homes lost in three years

Mumbai, the country‚Äôs most populous city, boasts glittering skyscrapers and glitzy luxury hotels. It‚Äôs also a city of widespread poverty and wealth inequality, where about 65% of its 12 million residents live in shacks of tarp and tin in crowded slums.

Yadav and his mother were evacuated to a school after their home was first swept away in 2019. The flood had killed 32 people, and authorities said the slum was too dangerous to live in ‚Äì but when an offer of new housing didn‚Äôt materialize, Yadav and his mother returned to the slum to rebuild.

‚ÄúMy house is about 10 by 15 feet and the floor is made of dirt,‚Äù Yadav said. ‚ÄúIn that soil, we have hammered down wooden poles. We tie them together and then cover it with plastic sheets. If there is a cyclone or a strong wind, it will be uprooted entirely.‚Äù

Family members started keeping what scarce valuables they had in plastic bags, so they could evacuate quickly. But there‚Äôs only so much you can protect.

During the 2020 monsoon season, Yadav and his mother once again lost their home, clothing and precious food items to rain and flooding. It happened again in May this year, when a massive cyclone hit India‚Äôs west coast ‚Äì an unusual event, since they typically strike the east coast.

Yadav said at that point, people were fed up with authorities and the constant cycle of destruction, evacuation and rebuilding. ‚ÄúHow can we live this way?‚Äù he said.

The most recent disaster came in September, at the tail end of this year‚Äôs monsoon season, when debris from past flooding swept toward the slum.

‚ÄúIt was around 1:30 in the (morning) and debris started flowing down,‚Äù Yadav said. ‚ÄúIt was raining heavily and we heard it moving.‚Äù

Residents were again evacuated to the school, where they remain to this day with little clean water or electricity and no toilets.

‚ÄúWe have no idea when we will go back or get another home,‚Äù Yadav said.

‚Äú(Authorities) are just saying that we will get housing in three to four days, but nothing is being done. People have lost their jobs and they don‚Äôt have money for food. The system is to blame here.‚Äù

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Mumbai‚Äôs governing body, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Places are becoming unlivable

As the climate crisis worsens, floods pose a particular danger to the 35% of India‚Äôs population ‚Äì roughly 472 million people ‚Äì who live in urban slums, according to the World Bank.

Muralee Thummarukudy, acting head of the UN Environment Program‚Äôs Resilience to Disasters and Conflicts Global Support Branch, said slum dwellers tend to live in flimsy structures on the outskirts of cities where land is less stable and more exposed to natural disasters. They also often don‚Äôt have any kind of insurance that allows them to rebuild or relocate.

These residents are also more vulnerable to the secondary effects of flooding, including the spread of waterborne diseases, groundwater contamination, and the loss of food supplies.

Rajan Samuel, managing director in India for Habitat for Humanity, says disasters wipe out livelihoods as well as homes.

‚ÄúThe trend I am seeing is that livelihood gets disrupted with every disaster, and then there is shelter which goes as well,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to mitigate both.‚Äù

Some states have taken action ‚Äì like Odisha, which built stormwater drains in its slums, or Kerala, which offers financial incentives for residents in climate-vulnerable places to relocate.

Yet on a national level, progress has been slow. Several ambitious initiatives to improve slums and retrofit cities have flailed over the past two decades, stymied by a lack of funding, insufficient participation, poor planning or the red tape of Indian bureaucracy, according to a number of international organizations, researchers and local media.

And though the government is now training cities across India to become ‚Äúclimate smart,‚Äù experts say there are many other measures that need to be taken ‚Äì like improving evacuation processes and redesigning water systems and other urban infrastructure.

Narain, from the Centre for Science and Environment, said existing systems were built ‚Äúat a time when disasters were still once in 10 years, once in five years. Now, it is 10 disasters a year.‚Äù

Recent floods, droughts and other devastating climate events are ‚Äúall showing us very clearly what will the future be,‚Äù she added.

Climate migrants

For years, climate experts and scientists have warned the climate crisis could displace more than a billion people in the coming decades ‚Äì potentially forming a class of ‚Äúclimate migrants‚Äù and refugees. Flooding is one of the major dangers, with record rainfall causing devastation in Germany and China this summer.

In India, people are already on the move.

Natural disasters forced more than 5 million Indians to leave their homes in 2019, according to a study conducted by the Sydney-based Institute for Economics and Peace. And that number is expected to rise as the climate crisis worsens.

Many of those displaced Indians, like Yadav, have no means to relocate and no choice but to continually rebuild their homes in disaster-prone locations.

Yadav and his family are reluctant to move from their patch of land in the slum, unless the government provides an alternative.

He and his mother are now surviving off their meager savings, money borrowed from relatives, and cash earned from pawning their jewelry.

Right now, he‚Äôs losing hope and dreading the thought of having to rebuild ‚Äì yet again.

‚ÄúIt has been going on for so long,‚Äù Yadav said. ‚ÄúYou never know if the water will flood the house and destroy the house.‚Äù",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Here are the latest updates on the flash flood situation, triggered by Hurricane Ida, in the United States:

1. At least 23 from New Jersey have perished in the massive flooding, according to the state's governor Phil Murphy. A victim at the Maplewood Township in New Jersey was swept away by the flash floods while he was apparently trying to remove debris from storm drains in the area, the police said.

2. At least 13 people have lost their lives to Ida's remnant flooding in New York City, as per the Reuters news agency. Three of them were found dead in a basement at a borough in Queens, while four residents of Elizabeth, New Jersey, died at a public housing complex flooded by 8 feet (2.4m) of water.

3. CNN estimates that the death toll from flooding had risen to 46, highlighting that ""dozens"" have died in at least six Eastern States -- Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia -- after the storm brought unprecedented rainfall to some areas. Deaths have also been reported from suburban Westchester County.

4. Subway service in New York City remained ""extremely limited,"" transit officials said, and commuter rail services to the suburbs were largely suspended. About 370 flights were canceled at New Jersey's Newark Liberty Airport.

5. Emergencies were declared for New York state, New York City, and New Jersey. The governors of the respective states have urged residents to stay home as crews worked to clear roadways and restore service to subways and commuter rail lines serving millions of residents. In New York City alone, emergency responders have rescued hundreds of people from vehicles on flooded roads and hundreds of others from the submerged subway lines.

6. Roadways were transformed into river-like torrents in minutes as the downpours struck on Wednesday night, trapping drivers in quickly rising floodwaters. In New York, nearly 500 vehicles were abandoned on flooded highways, garbage bobbed in streaming streets, and water cascaded into the city's subway tunnels, trapping at least 17 trains and disrupting service all day.

7. Meanwhile, the National Weather Service said that two ""tree-snapping tornadoes"" struck Maryland on Wednesday, one in Annapolis and another in Baltimore. A 19-year-old was reported to have died after trying to rescue his mother from a flooded apartment in Rockville, reported the Washington Post.

8. Hurricane Ida also made its presence felt in Philadelphia, where four people died as a result of the storm. A Connecticut state police sergeant, Brian Mohl, perished after his cruiser was swept away. Another death was reported in Maryland.

9. Officials said at least five people died in Pennsylvania, including one killed by a falling tree and another who drowned in his car after helping his wife to escape. In Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia, the Schuylkill River inundated hotels, warehouses, and condominiums that line the river. Emergency squads were reported to be waiting for the waters to recede before starting evacuations of possibly hundreds of people who live in nearby apartments.

10. Hurricane Ida's soggy remnants merged with a storm front and soaked the Interstate 95 corridor, meteorologists said. Similar weather has followed hurricanes before, but experts said it was slightly exacerbated by climate change ‚Äî warmer air holds more rain ‚Äî and urban settings, where expansive pavement prevents water from seeping into the ground.

Click here

The floods claimed three lives today. Two old women were drowned in flooded wells near Nangloi and a two year old girl in a nullah in Gulabi Bagh.

Almost all drains flowing into the river have been closed because they have started flowing back. Hundreds of huts in Jumna Bazar were flooded in the backwash of a nullah.

Long stretches of the GT Road have been submerged by the Jumna. Water one foot deep stood over several points near Badli. Some light vehicles were marooned in the submerged areas.

According to Mr Madan Mohan Singh Director, Public Relations, Delhi more than 1,500 houses have collapsed in 130 water-logged villages. Large areas with standing crops have been submerged. The total loss is estimated at over ‚Çπ1 crore.

He said the Jumna would rise further tomorrow. The discharge from the Tajewala headworks was today almost half of yesterdays. But the improvement will be seen only from Wednesday.

High level

The heavy discharge in the Najafgarh lake in West Delhi worsened the situation there today (August 28). The discharge from the Dhassa bund into the lake is about 1,800 cusecs against an outflow of 800 cusecs through the Najafgath nullah. This has brought many villages around the lake under water.

According to engineers, the Najafgarh nullah will rise further because of the reduced discharge of the nullah into the river at Wazirabad. In addition to the 300 cusecs from the Najafgarh lake a large quantity of water from the flooded villages is being drained out into the nullah. Because the river level is almost as high as the nullah level, only a small quantity of water flows into the river.

The engineers said there was no danger of the nullah bursting its banks unless it rained heavily.

The Jumna has started eroding part of the refuse dump at Badli. But the civic authorities said they had recently constructed a protective wall around the dump and the flood waters would not carry sullage into the river.

Click here

In July 2019, the Delhi government launched a water conservation project along the Yamuna river, which, the official said, aimed at recharging the depleting groundwater levels in the national capital. The project involved creating a reservoir to collect excess water from the Yamuna as it floods during the monsoon and giving it adequate time to recharge groundwater levels. The government was supposed to record developments of the project for three monsoons and prepare a report, that is to be shared with the NGT-appointed panel, for taking further call.

The government acquired 40 acres of land along the Yamuna floodplains near Palla ‚Äì not very far from the Delhi-Haryana border in Singhu village ‚Äì in 2019 for the project. Of the 40 acres, 10 belonged to gram sabhas in the area and 30 acres were acquired from farmers on three-year lease agreements. The government then created a reservoir of 17.6 acres.

The next year, the size of the reservoir was increased to 26 acres. In a four square metre area around the reservoir, which includes Palla, Bakhtawarpur, Tigipur, Sungarpur, Bakner, Mamorpur and a few other villages with vast stretches of paddy fields, the government set up a network of 33 piezometers ‚Äî devices that can measure the depth of groundwater.

‚ÄúIn 2019, the devices showed that the groundwater levels have risen upto 1.3 metres, and last year, the maximum rise recorded was 2 metres. This year, the devices recorded a maximum rise of 2.5 metres,‚Äù said the senior government official, who did not wish to be identified.

The reservoir is estimated to have contributed 4,350 million litres to the groundwater aquifer collectively in 2019 and 2020. ‚ÄúAssessment for 2021 is yet to be done. It will be incorporated in the final report. The government plans to submit the report to the NGT-appointed committee in another two months,‚Äù said the official.

The government has plans to expand the project to a 1,000-acre area stretching till Wazirabad, said a second official in the government‚Äôs irrigation and flood control department ‚ÄúTo understand why the project is evidently bearing fruit, one has to look at rainfall data, because rain plays the primary role here,‚Äù said the official.

According to the data of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi usually receives 653.6mm of rainfall during the monsoon season. In 2020, the city recorded 648.9mm of precipitation and 404mm rain in 2019. This monsoon, Delhi has received 1,169.7mm rainfall till 8pm on Sunday, the highest since 1964 (1,190.9 mm).

‚ÄúThe idea of the reservoir sounds feasible considering the soil type in Delhi, which allows quick percolation of water. If the government does not take measures to recharge groundwater levels now, things can get worse. Chennai has a severe groundwater depletion problem. Delhi should not become another Chennai,‚Äù said Sanjay Singh, national coordinator of Jan Jal Jodo Abhiyan, an advocacy group that works on access to water, conservation of water bodies, groundwater recharge and water security through community participation.

Farmers in the area, however, highlighted some concerns. ‚ÄúThere are issues pertaining to payment of rent in accordance with the lease. Those have to be resolved. The farmers who have given their lands have no other source of income,‚Äù said Ritesh Rana, a farmer and a resident of Bakhtawarpur village.

When HT visited the villages close to the reservoir this week, several farmers stressed on why they were unsure about the efficacy of the project.

‚ÄúMost farmers have water pumps and pipes that go 40 feet down. During monsoon, they face no problem anyway. We are not very sure about the changes in the groundwater level. We learn about the changes through data that is occasionally shared by government teams visiting the site,‚Äù said Pappan Singh Gahlot, a farmer and resident of Tigipur village.

There are also a lot of uncertainties. ‚ÄúWhat happens if the government plans to drop the project next year? The whole area has been dug up and farmers cannot cultivate this land without help from the government. Also, if they plan to expand it, they should inform farmers before the sowing season. Last time, they had to cut half-grown paddy to make space for the reservoir. Farmers in the area still feel that they have not been compensated adequately for the crop loss,‚Äù said Rai Singh Tanwar, a farmer from Sungarpur.

Office of Delhi‚Äôs water minister Satyendar Jain said: ‚ÄúThe impact assessment of the project is being done by the Joint Committee appointed by NGT. All the data pertaining to ground water levels, amount of water being recharged and rainfall in the local area is being shared with the Joint Committee. The study of water table is being done with piezometers network in the alignment of pond area and non- pond area and the requisite information will be available... It is expected that the Joint Committee shall submit its report to the NGT by the end of this year.‚Äù

On land lease amount concerns worrying farmers, Jain‚Äôs office said, ‚ÄúThe lease rent of land owners are being paid timely... according to the lease agreement by l&FC department for development of pilot project at village Sungerpur. The lease rent upto 2nd year has already been paid through online payment and 3rd year 1st quarter payment is under process . However. there was an issue with some farmers due to merger of banks and change in IFSC details , which has been sort out with concern land owners.‚Äù

On what will happen to the land if the project is dropped and other uncertainties, an officer in Jain‚Äôs office, who is also in charge of the irrigation and flood department, said: ‚ÄúAs per the terms and conditions of the lease agreement, if the project is not continued then the land of the farmers shall be returned to them by filling the land with the excavated earth and bringing it to the same elevation as the soil near the reservoir site. The lease is being paid to the farmers from the day their land was taken for the project. This means that the crop of the first year is also compensated. The lease was fixed by a multi department committee of the Delhi Government and has taken into account all the contingencies as far as possible. Otherwise on the success of project, the lease period will be increased accordingly or as directed by the Delhi government.‚Äù

Manoj Misra of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, a civil society consortium working for the Yamuna‚Äôs protection, however, flagged some concerns largely regarding challenges to fair assessment of the project.

‚ÄúThe project has been created in a floodplain. Floodplains have an organic relationship with rivers. During the monsoons, the rivers feeds on the floodplains. The water percolates and recharges aquifers, which can stretch for kilometres. During dry months, the aquifers feed the rivers and help them maintain a base flow. Being a perennial river, Yamuna is one such case. So, a large part of the water recharging process is automatic here,‚Äù said Mishra.

‚ÄúSecondly, in the absence of wells in the area and residents always getting access to water with the help of water pumps during monsoon, they would find it difficult to see any changes in the groundwater levels and the assessment would become completely dependent on government readings taken to piezometers. Also, 40 acres of land is too less an area for executing such a project and recording visible changes in water levels,‚Äù said Misra.

He further said, ‚ÄúFor fair and more efficient assessment, the government should consider creating a reservoir in the passive floodplains, ideally on the other side of the river embankment, instead of the active floodplains. This process will not work with the natural overflow of the river and will feed the reservoir automatically during monsoons and would require the government to set up arrangements to fill it up. It can give better results in terms of assessment of such a project.‚Äù",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

‚ÄúThe rescue operations at most of the landslide sites are expected to be called off by Monday as the chances of the recovery of missing people from the sites are very less. The bodies are likely to have been washed away with the current of the water and may have travelled far off,‚Äù a district official in Raigad said.

Raigad district, where a portion of a hillock flattened most of the Taliye village, burying 32 houses, has reported the maximum fatalities with 64 deaths so far, followed by 21 in Ratnagiri, 41 in Satara, 12 in Thane, seven in Kolhapur, four in suburban Mumbai, and two each in Sindhudurg and Pune, according to an official statement.

Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray visited Chiplun in Ratnagiri district, where a bridge on the Vashisthi river was damaged after heavy rain, and spoke to the residents, promising them assistance. ‚ÄúWe will require central assistance for long-term mitigation measures. The central government has provided assistance by deploying rescue teams from defence forces,‚Äù he later said. Thackeray said that the state‚Äôs economy was already ‚Äúsluggish‚Äù because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The government is assessing the extent of the damage in the flood-affected areas and a comprehensive report will soon be prepared, the CM said.

‚ÄúBut before that, all the basic facilities will be extended to the affected people. The flooding in Chiplun and Raigad has been unprecedented and people did not get a chance to save their belongings because it happened all of a sudden,‚Äù the chief minister said.

In the last 24 hours, one death was reported from Pune and one person was reported missing from Thane district, the government said in its statement.

Around 2,000 people were lodged at six relief camps in Ratnagiri, it said. According to official data, 229,084 people have been evacuated from vulnerable areas in nine districts since Thursday.

The death toll, however, is likely to increase, with heavy rainfall and tricky terrain in some areas stalling rescue operations.

Till Sunday, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), which is conducting rescue operations in Taliye in Raigad, Porase and Pedhe in Ratnagiri, and Mirgaon, Ambeghar and Dhokawale in Satara district, has retrieved 90 bodies. NDRF director general SN Pradhan tweeted the latest information of the force‚Äôs operations.

Thirty-three people have been reported missing in these three districts, the NDRF data updated till 6.30pm showed.

Teams of the local administrations and the State Disaster Relief Force, Coast Guard, Indian Navy and Indian Army are also undertaking rescue operations in the affected areas.

To assist in the flood relief, the army has also set up a central war room at the department of military affairs.

‚ÄúA central war room has been established at the Department of Military Affairs for close coordination between the three Services for ongoing flood relief operations in Maharashtra,‚Äù the army said on Twitter.

On Sunday, the chief minister said that a force similar to NDRF will be set up in the state and SDRF will be further strengthened.

‚ÄúConsidering the frequent natural calamities, a separate force on the lines of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) will be set up in all districts of the state. Similarly, a flood management machinery will also be set up,‚Äù Thackeray said, directing the local administration to provide food, water and medicines to the people who have been displaced in the last few days.

The chief minister said he will tour western Maharashtra on Monday.

Union minister Narayan Rane and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis visited Taliye on Sunday.

‚ÄúI have spoken to prime minister Narendra Modi before coming here. He has assured me all help from the central government. I will submit a report to the PM after the visit. The rehabilitation of the people affected in the landslide will be done at the site they want. Rescue teams of NDRF and armed forces have been deployed in affected district, we will try to keep a few teams stationed in Raigad or Ratnagiri keeping the constant risk of downpour every monsoon in mind,‚Äù Rane said. The damaged houses will be rebuilt under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, he added.

The water level in Krishna, Panchganga and Warana rivers in Kolhapur, and Krishna river in Sangli started receding on Sunday.

Minister of state for home and Kolhapur guardian minister Satej Patil said: ‚ÄúThe water level in major rivers has stabilised and the water on roads has started receding. However, the water level is still above the warning level and the situation will take a few days to normalise.‚Äù

A drain near Bhagsu Nag in upper Dharamshala adjoining Mecleodganj changed its course owing to heavy rains, sweeping away four cars and several bikes, video clips showed, as per the report.

A government school building at Bhagsunag was also damaged and adjacent hotels there were inundated, it showed.

""Due to inclement weather and heavy rains, all incoming flights to Dharamshala airport at Gaggal have been cancelled,"" said airport''s traffic in-charge Gaurav Kumar, as quoted by PTI.

Owing to flash flood at Manjhi Khad area adjoining Dharamshala, two buildings were swept away while several others were reported to be damaged. The flash floods also damaged a bridge on the Mandi-Pathankot highway after which traffic was stopped on both sides, leading to a traffic jam.

As per a PTI report, Union Home Minister Amit Shah spoke to Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur on Monday to take stock of the situation arising due to the floods in several districts of the state and assured him all possible help from the Centre.

Thakur also expressed concern over the losses due to heavy rain and directed the administrations of various districts to ensure speedy relief and rescue operation in the affected areas. He also urged the local people and tourists to refrain from going near the river banks to avoid any untoward incident.

Deputy Commissioner Dr Nipun Jindal said, as quoted by PTI, ""All the tourists visiting Dharamsala have been instructed to postpone their tour so that they do not face any kind of inconvenience.""

He said the tourists who have already arrived in Dharamshala and its surrounding places have also been advised to stay where they are as roads etc. have also been damaged due to heavy rains, which may cause problems in their movement. The district administration is also making elaborate arrangements for the safety of the tourists staying in Dharamshala and its surrounding areas, he said.

In case of any problem, they can contact the toll free number 1077 of the disaster control room, he said.

As per a report by ANI, Deputy Commissioner also informed that two persons went reportedly missing in Kangra district.

Officials have been directed to complete relief and rehabilitation immediately, he said, adding that control rooms have also been set up and steps have also been taken to make the weather forecast available to people, as per a PTI report.

Jindal said according to the Meteorological Department forecast, heavy rain on July 13 as well as from July 14 to 16 has been predicted. Keeping this in mind, orders have been issued under the Disaster Management Act 2005 to district officers of all the departments in Kangra district to remain alert.",flood,Dharamshala flash floods,"Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh",12-07-2022,13-07-2022,"['Dharamshala', 'Kangra district']",['200 mm'],"['Four cars and several bikes swept away', 'Government school building damaged', 'Adjacent hotels inundated', 'Two buildings swept away', 'Bridge damaged', 'Traffic jam']",['2'],"['Tourists instructed to postpone their visit', 'Two persons reportedly missing', 'Control rooms set up', 'Weather forecast made available to people']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe
delhi,2021,https://india.mongabay.com/2021/11/freely-available-geospatial-dataset-to-make-flood-research-easier/,16-Nov-21,Freely-available geospatial dataset to make flood research easier,"India‚Äôs first digital flood inventory has digitised flooding events from 1985 to 2016 using data from the India Meteorological Department.

The digital inventory will aid future data collection efforts, scientific research on floods, disaster risk reduction, loss and damage estimates and pave the way to develop financial products to tackle disaster risks.

Stakeholders working to build financial products and mechanisms such as disaster risk insurances including crop insurances could also benefit from the dataset.

Data on fatalities and damage associated with India‚Äôs flooding events from 1985 to 2016 have been meticulously mined from printed government records and combined with information from global databases to create India‚Äôs first digital flood inventory freely available in modern geospatial formats.

The India Flood Inventory (IFI) pools 89% of its data from the India Meteorological Department‚Äôs Disastrous Weather Events, and the remaining from Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) and Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO), states the paper documenting the inventory‚Äôs inception.

‚ÄúWe have taken decades of data from the published document by IMD‚Äôs DWE, digitised it, fixed a lot of things, and augmented it with geospatial information in the form of GIS files. Each historical flooding event now has its information digitised, which IMD didn‚Äôt have till now,‚Äù said Manabendra Saharia from IIT-Delhi‚Äôs Hydrosense Lab, who led the development of the inventory.

The objective was to provide a ready-made database to the community that could be used for future work including disaster management personnel and scientists working on flood research and management. The inventory will also aid future data collection efforts.

Floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters. India is one of the most affected countries with the increasing frequency and intensity of floods, leading to loss of lives and livelihoods. The latest assessment report from IPCC‚Äôs Working Group 1, finds that climate change is intensifying the water cycle which will bring more rainfall and associated flooding in some regions. In-depth research and better early warning systems (EWS) are needed for India to adapt to such disasters. The most important component for carrying on with in depth research and EWS is data.

Data to help with attribution, modeling and forecast

‚ÄúIf a disaster management personnel looks at the dataset, they would have a searchable archive of every flooding event as recorded by IMD. While IMD will admit there are observational deficiencies in the collection, this is the best possible available historical information which helps personnel to assess how many people have died in historical flooding events, or how much paddy has been destroyed to plan for food shortages etc. and for which months,‚Äù said Saharia.

The scientists marked every event with a Unique Event Identifier making it easy to reference with other datasets through a common database scheme; dates were made compliant to ISO 8601, an internationally accepted calendar-and-clock format. Information on human fatalities, animal fatalities, damages etc. was extracted from the dataset and coordinates of the events were verified.

India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientist D.S. Pai, the co-author of the paper, shares that the inventoried data would help with attribution analysis, improve modeling and forecast. ‚ÄúImproved modeling and flood forecasting would help strengthen our flood early warning systems,‚Äù the Pune-based Pai, Head, Climate Research & Services, IMD, Ministry of Earth Sciences told Mongabay-India. ‚ÄúThe data would also aid with hazard mapping and vulnerability analysis,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúAnalysis of the data in the inventory highlights that the majority of floods in the country happen in the monsoon season, which is 79% of the yearly total, with a peak in July. While the number of flood fatalities during the same period is 83% of the yearly total, with a peak in August,‚Äù the paper states.

Large flood plains such as Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Maharashtra, Bihar, and West Bengal experience the highest number of floods and fatalities. While, the hill states such as Uttarakhand have experienced catastrophic events, with some of the highest per-capita death rates in the country.

The inventory reveals three major flood events: the Brahmaputra floods in 1988 and 2004 and the 1987 Bihar floods that affected the entire state.

Sushma Guleria, assistant professor at the National Institute of Disaster Management, who was not associated with the inventory work, explained that historical data of flooding events also come in handy to implement post-disaster needs assessment (PDNA) contributing to the collection and standardisation of loss and damage data in the aftermath of floods. ‚ÄúHaving access to historical data would also help to track the intangible damages such as displacement, property damage, impacts on ecosystems and psychological effects of loss of life, that can be long-lasting and earmark adequate compensation for flood-affected families factoring in the tangible and intangible impacts,‚Äù Guleria told Mongabay-India.

Saharia adds that it could also benefit stakeholders working to build financial products and mechanism such as disaster risk insurances including crop insurances.

Loss and damage due to climate disasters and slow onset events like sea-level rise and climate finance to address loss and damage and decarbonisation efforts by developing countries were important issues for these countries at the recently concluded United Nations climate conference in Glasgow or COP26.

The United Nations weather agency World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in its report State of the Climate in Asia 2020 said India lost USD87 billion in 2020 due to cyclones, floods and droughts. Floods and cyclones contribute to maximum human deaths in India from extreme weather events (EWEs) in the past 50 years.

At COP26 which saw India pledge to net zero commitments by 2070, the nation also stood its ground demanding climate finance to act on its climate commitments. The richest one percent of the world‚Äôs population is responsible for more than twice the combined share of carbon emissions of the poorest 50 percent.

delhi,2021,https://thewire.in/environment/over-five-lakh-affected-by-floods-in-uttar-pradesh,13-Aug-21,Over Five Lakh Affected by Floods in Uttar Pradesh,"New Delhi: Over five lakh people in 1,243 villages of Uttar Pradesh have been affected by floods, officials said on Wednesday after the state recorded an average of 13.1 mm rainfall in a 24-hour period which is 154 per cent more than normal.

The conditions were, however, hot and humid in neighbouring Delhi and Punjab and Haryana, while in Uttarakhand, two people have died in rain-related incidents amid an incessant downpour in various parts of the state.

A skewed rainfall distribution has caused concerns in Rajasthan, a state where some parts have received excessive rainfall while others saw below-average showers.

In the national capital, the minimum and the maximum temperatures were recorded at 26.4 degrees Celsius and 36.2 degrees Celsius respectively.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), sultry conditions are likely to continue in the city with no rainfall expected for another five to six days.

A weather department official said the monsoon has entered a ‚Äúbreak phase‚Äù and rainfall will remain subdued in northwest India at least till August 16.

In Uttar Pradesh, 11 districts Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Kaushambi, Pratapgarh, Basti, Gonda, Sultanpur, Shrawasti, Lucknow, Raebareli and Fatehpur received 25 mm or more rainfall in a span of 24 hours.

A report from the Relief Commissioner‚Äôs office said a ‚Äúpopulation of 5,46,049 in 1,243 villages in 23 districts is affected by floods‚Äù.

According to reports by the irrigation department, the river Ganga is flowing above the danger mark in Budaun, Prayagraj, Mirzapur, Varanasi, Ghazipur and Ballia, while the Yamuna river is flowing above the red mark in Auraiya, Jalaun, Hamirpur, Banda and Prayagraj.

Similarly, river Betwa is above the danger mark in Hamirpur, Sharda river in Pallia Kalan (Kheri) and the Quano river in Chandradeep ghat (Gonda), it said.

In Uttarakhand, a woman died and five people were injured when a house collapsed in Almora district on Wednesday amid incessant rainfall, while a man drowned in the swollen Shakti canal in Dehradun.

Continuous rainfall has triggered landslides at a number of places, blocking traffic movement, officials said. Three highways and around 100 motor roads in various parts of the state are blocked by landslide debris, the state disaster management centre here said.

Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, meanwhile, expressed concerns over the skewed rainfall distribution in the state.

According to water resources department data, 10 of the state‚Äôs 33 districts are under the deficit rainfall category, while nine are under the ‚Äònormal rainfall‚Äô category and as many are under the ‚Äòexcessive rains‚Äô category.

Five districts have recorded abnormal rains and there is no district under the scant rainfall category, the data shows.

‚ÄúExcessive rainfall in several parts of the state and below-average in some is a matter of concern. Instructions have been issued to the administration for special girdawari (inspection) in different districts so that timely assistance can be provided to the affected,‚Äù Gehlot tweeted.

He said parts of the state receive rain in August also which may cover the deficit. ‚ÄúThe same is expected from the forecasts of the Meteorological Department this time, he added.

From June 1 to August 12, the state as a whole recorded normal rainfall with 8.3% more than the average, according to a report by the water resources department.

Kota division, comprising Kota, Bundi, Baran and Jhalawar districts, has received abnormal rains with 87.2% more than the average rains. Many areas in the division faced flood-like situation due to excessive rains which damaged property and crops.

A six-member inter-ministerial panel reached Kota on Wednesday evening and visited flood-affected areas on Thursday morning to assess crop and property damage.

According to Kota district collector Ujjawal Rathore, at least 508 villages were adversely affected by the recent heavy rainfall in Kota district.

Bharatpur division received abnormal rains while normal precipitation was observed in Ajmer, Bikaner, Jaipur and Udaipur divisions. Jodhpur division recorded deficit rains.

Districts with deficit rains (-20% to -59% of the long period average) are; Banswara, Barmer, Dungarpur, Ganganagar, Jalore, Jodhpur, Pali, Rajsamand, Sirohi and Udaipur.

Ajmer, Alwar, Bhilwara, Bikaner, Chittorgarh, Hanumangarh, Jhunjhunu, Nagaur and Sikar recorded normal rains (19 to -19%).

Bharatpur, Churu, Dausa, Dholpur, Jaipur, Jaisalmer, Karauli, Pratapgarh and Tonk are under the excess rainfall category (20% to 59%), whereas Baran, Bundi, Jhalawar, Kota and Sawaimadhopur recorded abnormal rains (60% or more).

In Punjab and Haryana, hot and humid weather conditions prevailed at most places, with common capital Chandigarh recording a maximum temperature of 35.6 degrees Celsius.

According to the Chandigarh weather office, Ambala in Haryana recorded a maximum temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius, while Hisar registered a high of 37 degrees Celsius.

Rohtak recorded a maximum temperature of 35.8 degrees Celsius, Bhiwani 37.8 degrees Celsius and Gurgaon 35.8 degrees Celsius.

In Punjab, Amritsar recorded a maximum of 36 degrees Celsius, Ludhiana 35.2 degrees Celsius, Patiala 36.1 degrees Celsius and Bathinda 35.5 degrees Celsius.

DJB vice-chairperson Raghav Chadha on Monday said the water utility has overcome the supply issue. He also visited DJB‚Äôs Bhagirathi Water Treatment Plant (WTP) to take stock of the situation. ‚ÄúWe treat the raw Ganga water which comes from the Upper Ganga Canal at Muradnagar and provide it to Delhi households. But, due to the calamity in Uttarakhand, the quality of water has worsened. The water which we are getting now is of very poor quality as it has a lot of dirt and other particles. Water quality is measured in nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) which touched 8,000, while the permissible limit is 100,‚Äù said Chadha.

Chadha said the DJB shut down the Sonia Vihar and Bhagirathi WTPs. The production capacity of these plants was brought down to combat the situation, he said. These plants together provide around 250 MGD water per day.





‚ÄúDue to high level of dirt in the raw water, supply was affected in areas of south, east and north-east Delhi. He said in Bhagirathi treatment plant, water NTU has been reduced from 8000 to 960 and in Sonia Vihar it has been brought down from 8200 NTU to 1000,‚Äù said Chadha.

Residents in several areas complained of zero or irregular supply on Monday. These include Greater Kailash-2, Defence Colony, Vigyan Vihar, South Extension-2, Kailash Colony, Jamia Nagar, Panchsheel Enclave, Krishna Nagar, Jafrabad, Seelampur among others.

The DJB in a statement said the Bhagirathi water treatment plant (WTP) is now working at 100% and Sonia Vihar at 80% capacity.

In many areas, residents had to buy water cans or rely on private tankers to meet the water shortage. RWAs also issued instructions to residents to judiciously use water for a few days due to the crisis.

Sanjay Rana, president, Greater Kailash-2 RWA, said there was no prior intimation about the disruption of water supply hence people could not fill their tanks or store water.

‚ÄúThere had been no supply of water since Sunday evening. The authorities told us about the water crisis only on Sunday evening, saying that there will be no supply in the evening and next (Monday) morning as well. This sudden situation led to water shortage in almost every household in the area. People had to buy 20-litre water cans to do their daily chores,‚Äù Rana said.

He added that the DJB officials have assured them that the supply would become normal by Tuesday.

Ranjeet Singh, president, Defence Colony RWA, said there was no water supply in the area. ‚ÄúWater supply was impacted in the colony since Sunday evening, and it worsened on Monday morning as there was no supply today. No one got the opportunity to fill their tanks or store extra water as there was no prior intimation,‚Äù Singh said.

Several areas in east Delhi were also due to the break in supply.

BS Vohra, president of a joint forum of east Delhi RWAs said in some areas such as Vigyan Vihar, Preet Vihar among others there was no water supply on Monday while in certain areas the supply was either for short duration or the quality of water was very bad.

‚ÄúIn areas such as Krishna Nagar, Geeta Colony the water was supplied for a shorter duration and also it was very dirty. We could not fill tanks due to dirty water. Through TV and other mediums, we got to know about water crisis in Delhi due to flash floods in Uttarakhand but the DJB did not send an official communication to the RWAs. We are not sure if the supply will be restored by Tuesday,‚Äù Vohra said.

On the allegations that the DJB did not inform the residents in advance, a DJB spokesperson said, ‚ÄúThe information that the water supply will be affected was put out for the knowledge of general public through social media handles. It was tweeted during the day on Sunday by the vice chairperson and most MLAs also sent out messages to RWA groups. ‚Äù

delhi,2021,https://www.newsclick.in/pune-metro-pillars-river-heighten-flood-risk-will-they-be-reconsidered,24-Jan-21,"Pune Metro: Pillars in River Heighten Flood Risk, Will They Be Reconsidered?","The floods of August and September 2019 claimed 22 lives in Pune city. There is a cause for worry that the now-completed construction of about 60 pillars of the Maha Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL), Pune, on the East bank of the Mutha (which is part of the Krishna River basin and flows through the heart of Pune), along 1.45 km, will cause more frequent flooding in the core city area, the most thickly populated part of Pune. The pillars have been constructed within the ‚Äòblue line‚Äô area, which marks the area of possible submergence if 60,000 cubic feet per second water is discharged from the Khadakwasla dam.

On January 11, 2021, Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS) Pune submitted a report after conducting simulation studies for water afflux from the dam, with and without the metro pillars. A 15-km stretch of the river, from Khadakwasla Dam to its confluence with the Mula river was studied for this purpose. Pune city spreads across both banks of the Mutha, and there are 16 bridges in the area that this report studied. The report estimated the spread of the afflux at each bridge, for two river discharges of 60,000 cubic feet per second and 100,000 cubic feet per second.

Computational resource developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers at the Army‚Äôs Hydrologic Engineering Centre, which is used across the world for such purposes, was used to estimate water spread. Initial simulation was for water surface elevation without the metro piers; existing bridges were incorporated in the model. Later, the metro piers and related infrastructure were introduced into the model. For discharge of 100,000 cubic feet per second, it was found that maximum afflux of 380 mm would be observed at pier number P152. An aerial survey using drones was conducted by MMRCL, given there was some discussion over the availability of only restricted cross sections of the river in the models that were used. Data from the drone survey too was used in the report.

Water spread beyond the riverbed, on account of the pillars, would reach up to 140.40 metres at the Z Bridge if 100,000 cusecs of water is released from the dam, the report states.

Prominent citizens of Pune had raised the red flag when this alignment of the metro project was first announced, arguing that the pillars would obstruct the flow of the river and cause flooding. In 2016, journalist Dileep Padgaonkar, who passed away in November that year, businesswoman Anu Aga, artist Arti Kirloskar and environmentalist Sarang Yadwadkar filed a case before the National Green Tribunal questioning this alignment.

NGT granted permission for the construction of the pillars in 2018, on the basis of a report by an expert committee assessing the impact of the pillars on flooding. The petitioners then approached the Supreme Court, where in February 2019 they proved that the expert committee had calculated the possible flooding on the basis of the wrong width of the riverbed ‚Äì the committee‚Äôs assessment of the riverbed was 25% in excess of its actual size.

The expert committee acknowledged the error by February 2020, blaming the MMRCL for providing it wrong data. A fresh study was then undertaken by CWPRS, and the results of this report, made available days ago, show the urgent need to realign this stretch of the metro to prevent flooding and loss of life in the city.

In a statement released to the press, Rajya Sabha MP Vandana Chavan and environmentalist Sarang Yadwadkar ask why MMRCL did not consult CWPRS earlier; why was wrong data earlier provided to the expert committee that made the assessment of the impact of the pillars; why did the expert committee not verify river width data that it had received; and why did construction of the pillars continue despite all the warnings from citizens.

Anu Aga warns that even though much money has already been spent on the pillars, the government must realign this stretch to prevent future flooding and loss of life.

The first phase of the Pune Metro project covers about 31 km, and is estimated to cost over Rs 11,000 crore. Over Rs 6000 crore of this is from a loan from the World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

The problem of flooding in cities has been happening with increasing frequency in recent years. Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, says, ‚ÄúThe urban water sector is huge, but operates in a policy vacuum. The increasing destruction of water bodies, floodplains, mangroves, rivers and streams has happened alongside increasing paved surfaces, depleting groundwater levels and increasing pollution of rivers. Lip service is paid to rainwater harvesting, while supply is from dam-based water from long distances away. The urban construction boom also has a huge impact, with the mining of sand from the rivers. The cumulative impact of these developments coupled with the changing rainfall pattern lead to increased frequency and intensity of urban floods.‚Äù

In September 2014, Srinagar was flooded and over 250 lives were lost. Centre for Science and Environment noted that in one century, half the lakes, ponds and wetlands of Srinagar had been encroached upon. The banks of the Jhelum too had been taken over for construction, restricting the space available for natural drainage.

About a decade prior to that, on July 26, 2005, Mumbai saw 994 mm of rain in one day, and was brought to a standstill. About 1,000 lives were lost and thousands of houses were ruined. The need for the conservation of wetlands and mangroves, that may have reduced the impact of the flooding by serving as a buffer, was remarked about after that. Even so, between 1991 and 2001, about 9,000 acres of mangroves were lost. The construction of the country‚Äôs first bullet train, the Navi Mumbai International Airport and the coastal road project were all eating into mangroves.

In the winter of 2015, Chennai witnessed heavy rain in a short spell of time and was flooded. The Comptroller and Auditor General would describe the event as a ‚Äúmanmade disaster‚Äù ‚Äì caused by the indiscriminate discharge of water into the Adyar river. Kerala witnessed floods in 2018 and 2019, which claimed about 500 lives.

Despite the common knowledge that construction close to river banks could exacerbate flooding, such projects continue. The Central Vistal project in New Delhi will see the construction of what is called an ""iconic structure"" on the west bank of the Yamuna.

‚ÄúIt is noteworthy that there is no requirement for an independent assessment of the impact of bridges, flyovers, metro projects and roads encroaching floodplains and rivers. The cumulative impact of such interventions is huge,‚Äù Thakker points out.

A World Meteorological Organization report highlighted that extreme floods in Kerala in 2018 led to total economic losses of $4.3 billion, the displacement of 1.4 million people, and 5.4 million people being affected in some way in 2018.

Though an economic estimate of the cumulative economic impact of three flood years ‚Äî 2018, 2019, and now, 2021 ‚Äî hasn‚Äôt been made, it has been an overwhelming blow to infrastructure and livelihoods in the state which continues to reel under the Covid-19 pandemic.

What happened on October 16?

Peninsular India was recording widespread rains since October 11 even before flooding was triggered in some districts of Kerala on October 16. In September, south peninsular India recorded 21.6% excess rains.

On October 14, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that two low-pressure areas ‚Äî one over east-central and the adjoining southeast Arabian Sea, and another over the central Bay of Bengal (BoB) ‚Äî formed, which would bring heavy rain to Kerala, Tamil Nadu, coastal and south interior Karnataka, along with Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal on the east coast.

‚ÄúThough on two different sides, these low-pressure systems influenced circulation patterns. The system over BoB helped strengthen the winds along the Arabian Sea. It also influenced the movement of the low-pressure area over the Arabian Sea, which came very close to the Kerala coast and interacted with the hilly regions, bringing a lot of rain in certain parts. We cannot comment on how the rain triggered landslides, but rainfall amounts were very high,‚Äù explained K Sathi Devi, head of the National Weather Forecasting Centre.

Between October 16 and the morning of October 17, Idukki recorded 31 centimetres (cm) of rain, Kottayam ‚Äî 27 cm, Thrissur and Kollam ‚Äî 17 cm, Kozhikode ‚Äî 15 cm, Kannur and Pathanamthitta ‚Äî 14 cm. With already high water levels in reservoirs, rivers and streams may have overflown due to a sudden increase in rain on October 16.

‚ÄúWhile BoB low-pressure system moved west northwestwards across north coastal Andhra Pradesh and south Odisha coast, the Arabian Sea system moved east southeastwards and finally the BoB low-pressure system moved towards Telangana and the Arabian Sea system reached Kerala coast on October 16. There was maximum rainfall activity over Kerala compared to other states. This low-pressure system led to the strengthening of monsoon westerly winds near the Kerala coast, which interacted with ghat areas resulting in heavy to extremely heavy rainfall over Kerala specially Idukki, Kollam, and Ernakulam districts experienced extremely heavy rain,‚Äù explained M Mohapatra, director-general, IMD.

Kerala: Vulnerable to climate disasters

The elevation in Kerala ranges from -48 metres (m) below sea level in the backwaters and other low-lying areas, to +2,692 m in the hills above the mean sea level. Around 35% of the area is between 0-50m, 39.82% of the area is between 50-500 m, and 24% of the area is above 500m, making its topography vulnerable, according to a presentation made by KJ Ramesh, former director-general of IMD based on data from National Remote Sensing Centre in 2018.

Several experts believe that Kerala‚Äôs topography, combined with extreme rainfall events in a short period and unsuitable land use makes the perfect recipe for disaster.

Interestingly, the monsoon rain has weakened over Kerala, and the state has witnessed a significant drying trend in recent years.

According to Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region, a report by the ministry of earth sciences published last year, as compared to 1901‚Äì1975, rainfall has reduced by 1‚Äì5 mm/day during 1976‚Äì2015 over central parts of India (the core monsoon zone), Kerala, and extreme northeastern parts, and has increased over the Jammu and Kashmir region as well as in parts of western India.

Central India, Kerala, some regions of the south peninsula, along with the northeastern parts of India, also experienced a higher annual frequency of droughts, with more than two droughts per decade on average from 1951‚Äì2016, the report added.

Despite the weakening of monsoon circulation, there has been a threefold rise in extreme rain events over central India and the Western Ghats, including parts of Kerala, according to a study led by Roxy Mathew Koll and his team at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) published in Nature in 2017. This concluded that the threefold rise in extreme rain along the west coast and central India was recorded from 1950 to 2015.

‚ÄúChanges in the monsoon winds are reflected well in Kerala, due to its proximity to the Arabian Sea. The moisture carrying monsoon winds interact with the mountainous topography of Kerala, resulting in orographic rainfall. Rainfall data since 1950 shows that the frequency of extreme rainfall events has increased over Kerala, particular for the central hilly regions of the Idukki, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts. Here, the total rainfall during the monsoon season has decreased, but the number of heavy rains has increased. There is a clear climate crisis signal because, as the temperature rises, the moisture-holding capacity of the air increases. Hence, it does not rain for a long period, and when it rains, it dumps all the moisture in a short spell,‚Äù explained Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at IITM, Pune.

‚ÄúThe landslides and floods are not solely due to heavy rains. Often, we are quick to blame the climate crisis. However, we need to realise that roughly half of Kerala is hills and mountainous regions, where the slope is more than 20 degrees. These places are, hence, prone to landslides. When we have land-use changes and development such as quarrying, roads, construction, and deforestation in these regions, the vulnerability of these hills increases. Hence, when heavy rains lash on these hills, landslides happen quickly. This is a situation where the impact of both climate change and direct human intervention in terms of land-use changes are manifesting as landslides and floods,‚Äù he added.

These extreme rain events interact with the topography. This mechanism was seen during all three floods in the past four years. IMD, in its report on the 2018 Kerala floods, said that the landslides and floods ‚Äúcan be attributed to [the] consecutive formation (within seven days) of the low pressure system on August 6 and 13 morning. Further both these low-pressure systems intensified into depression and moved west-northwestwards along the monsoon trough. It led to [the] strengthening of westerly-southwesterly winds along and off Kerala coasts as the cross-equatorial monsoon flow increased towards the region of low-pressure system. These stronger winds interacted with the Western Ghats leading to [the] orographic uplifting of moist air.‚Äù

This led to the development of clouds, and, hence, heavy rainfall. This year too, the strong westerly winds from the Arabian Sea interacted with the ghat regions to bring unprecedented amounts of rain during a short time.

‚ÄúKerala gets good rains during monsoons, over 300 cm annually. Over 10% of Kerala‚Äôs land is coastal, and the easternmost part is mostly a hilly region. Almost 50% of Kerala‚Äôs land is hilly or ghat dominated. Geographically, this makes Kerala extremely vulnerable. So, when the monsoon is very active, or a low-pressure area develops, there can be very heavy rain over the ghat regions because of the interaction of winds from the Arabian Sea with the hill regions. In August and September, when this happens, the rivers and reservoirs are already full, and start overflowing, triggering mudslides and landslides. This year, the monsoon was very active in September, leading to full rivers and then, once again, low-pressure areas developed in October resulting in floods,‚Äù explained DS Pai, scientist and head of climate research and services, IMD Pune.

He highlighted that ‚Äúheavy rain in monsoon is not a surprise for Kerala. My understanding is that extreme rainfall induced by the climate crisis is exacerbated by land-use change in Kerala. Kerala has one of the highest population densities and people are inhabiting ghat areas. They are doing agriculture and monocultures there which has a big impact in triggering severe disasters like we are seeing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is a combination of the global climate crisis and local, undesirable changes in land use in Kerala and the entire Western Ghats. Illegal store quarries, for example, all along the Western Ghats are causing severe localised aerosol loading which leads to fluctuation in rainfall patterns. For example, rainfall that may have occurred over 5-6 hours can occur in half an hour in some areas. In Ratnagiri, we saw devastating floods this monsoon which is also very clearly linked to land-use change. There is photographic evidence to show road construction works through hills triggered landslides in Konkan. So today, what Kerala is experiencing is a result of global climate change and local extremely undesirable land use planning,‚Äù said Madhav Gadgil, chairman of the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel and veteran ecologist.

Kerala has to brace for another climate crisis impact ‚Äî the rise in sea level. The Indian Ocean, which includes the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, has warmed faster than the global average, said the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) with ‚Äúvery high confidence‚Äù in its Physical Science Basis report released in August.

IPCC‚Äôs oceans factsheet indicates that sea surface temperature over the Indian Ocean is likely to increase by 1 to 2 degrees C (¬∞C) when there is 1.5¬∞C to 2¬∞C global warming.

‚ÄúAbout 50% of the sea level rise is due to the thermal expansion. Also, the Indian Ocean region is warming at a higher rate that means the relative sea level can also increase over the regions. Hence, the coastal regions in India will see the sea level rise through the 21st century, and it will contribute to more frequent and severe coastal flooding in low level areas and coastal erosion. Along with this, extreme sea level events that were previously seen once in a hundred years, could also happen every year by the end of the century,‚Äù Swapna Panickal, IPCC author and climate scientist from IITM explained in August.

Lack of land-use planning

The Western Ghats are an extremely ecologically fragile region. The Madhav Gadgil Committee (Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel or WGEEP) in 2010 recommended that 75% of the 129,037 sq km of the area (spanning Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Goa) be declared an environmentally sensitive area (ESA) because of its dense, rich forest cover, and a large number of endemic species.

WGEEP advocated a graded or layered approach within the broad framework of ESZ1 (environmentally sensitive zone), ESZ2 and ESZ3.

Later, a panel headed by K Kasturirangan, the former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) chief, scaled it down to 50%. The Gadgil committee categorised several areas in ghat regions of Kerala as ESZ 1 ‚Äîof highest priority where no monocultures, mining, quarrying, no new polluting industry can be allowed, among other restrictions.

Neither of the two reports has been implemented yet. A senior official of the Union environment ministry said, on condition of anonymity, in August that ‚Äústates had various reservations with the recommendations. And because of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have sought time till December 31 to declare ESAs in the Western Ghats, so we have time to discuss and resolve the differences with the Western Ghat states.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Western Ghats are the perfect storm because of coastal areas vulnerable to any activity in the Arabian sea, being ecologically sensitive and significant, and then there is the land-use that is far from optimal, to say nothing of the unequal patterns of ad-hoc development. We cannot be responding to each event as a standalone. These events are happening all too often and usually in tandem with other stressors such as what‚Äôs happening with Covid-19 or for many people, existing stresses of poverty and inequality. The Sendai Framework for disaster risk reduction also suggests that we adopt a more pre-emptive strategy to dealing with disasters rather than after the fact. What‚Äôs compounding the issue in the Western Ghats is the planning and land-use activity that hasn‚Äôt fully taken into account suggestions by the Gadgil committee. One of the key aspects of that report was to consult with local bodies and Panchayats on any development activities in the region,‚Äù said Smitha Rao, a faculty member at The Ohio State University who specialises in disasters and environmental justice.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

At least 40 villages in Indonesia's Aceh Jaya district have been struck by floods triggered by incessant rains, the local disaster mitigation agency said on Tuesday.

""We have received a report on the flooded 40 villages. Now we are collecting data as the number could increase,"" an agency official said.

He said the agency has sent a team to help mitigate floods in the affected villages including those in Krueng Sabe and Setia Bakti sub-districts, reports Xinhua news agency.

""We hope that the sub-districts, especially the sub-district heads, will continue to monitor developments in the fields and report to us the inundated villages,"" he said.

Click here

All natural disasters, including floods extract heavy human costs. The poor live at subsistence levels and such shocks are always very harsh on them. But the prospect of greater wealth destruction during natural disasters is also worse news for the Indian economy.

A simple comparison illustrates the point. From 2008 to 2014, houses were damaged in both Bihar and Kerala every year because of floods and heavy rains. A 2018 Central Water Commission (CWC) report shows that the value lost per damaged house was almost four times in Kerala as in Bihar: ‚Çπ2,857 in Bihar and ‚Çπ10,906 in Kerala. More than the intensity of floods, this numbers reflects the fact that Kerala houses are better-built than Bihar, because the former has higher per capita income.

Richer states and non-farm sector are suffering more damage in floods now

A 2018 CWS report gives state-wise value of damages caused by floods from 1953 to 2016. Sorting these states by per capita GSDP shows that the share of the bottom one-third of states in flood related damages has reduced from more than 50% to just above one-third between 1961-2000 and 2001-2016. This means that India‚Äôs more affluent states are suffering a higher damage in floods.

Floods are now increasingly affecting the non-farm sector in India. In the 1961 to 2000 period, an average of 58% of the damage caused by floods annually was from the damage to crops while 27% was from public utilities. This pattern has now reversed. From 2001 to 2016, crop loss accounted for an average 29.7% of the damage, while public utilities accounted for 58.6% of monetary losses due to floods. What explains these two changes? Both the climate crisis and the nature of urbanisation are to blame.

Intense rainfall is increasing in districts with more affluence

While floods affect all, they seem to affect some more than others. Counterintuitive as it sounds, floods cause more monetary damage if they affect an area with a greater share of rich. This is due to the simple reason that richer dwellings have more valuable items than their poorer counterparts. A joint reading of an HT analysis of rainfall patterns and a Mint database of district-wise wealth tracker shows that India‚Äôs richer districts are becoming more vulnerable to floods now.

Mint‚Äôs wealth tracker uses the 2015-16 National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) to rank districts on the basis of assets and amenities (pucca house, electricity connection, phone, television, AC/cooler, refrigerator, washing machine, and motorized vehicle) owned by households. A household is described as affluent if it owns at least six of the eight assets listed here. HT has used the India Meteorological Department‚Äôs gridded rainfall database to look at the increase in heavy and extreme rainfall in comparison to the long period average (LPA).

The median share of the affluent in districts where heavy and extreme rainfall ‚Äì when a lot of rain happens in very little time or over a very small area ‚Äì has increased the most during the 2015 to 2020 period is 20.73%. This share becomes smaller as we move to districts where such rainfall has increased by lesser degrees. In districts where heavy and extreme rainfall has increased the least, the median share of the affluent was 15.4%.

It should be kept in mind that the district-wise increase in heavy/extreme rainfall is a relative measure as it is being tracked against past rainfall (1961-2010) in the same district.

Concrete jungles without drains are bound to get flooded

Almost every time Kerala faces serious floods, the Cochin airport has to suspend operations, as the runway gets flooded. This should not be surprising. Where the airport has been built, there used to be paddy fields at one point of time, where flooding was a boon rather than a bane.

A similar case is of the Santacruz airport in Mumbai built on the floodplains of the Mithi River. During heavy rains in July, Mumbai airport has had to temporarily suspend operations due to waterlogging on either the runways or tarmac in 2017 and in 2021. However, disruptions due to turbulence following heavy rainfall events are more common, recurring every year since 2017. In 2019, a passenger aircraft overshot the main runway while landing in heavy rains on July 2. The main runway remained shut for close to four days. It is common for operations to become restricted to a single runway during heavy rains. Expansion of the airport has squeezed the Mithi river into a small stream, and the construction of a second runway in 1970 created a right-angle bend in the river which has worsened flooding.

The cases of these airports are symptomatic of a larger problem with India‚Äôs changing land-use pattern. The National Statistical Office (NSO) gives remote sensing-based land-use statistics in India. Built up area increased from 118,998 square kilometres in 2011-12 to 121,848 square kilometres in 2015-16. Of the 3,609 square kilometres added from other sources, 73% came from agriculture, 5.7% from forest land, and 3.3% from grass or grazing land. These numbers capture the rapid surge in concretisation in India in the recent past. An increase in concretised area also means that rainwater does not seep into the ground. In the short-term, this means waterlogging and, in the long-term, it means a fall in replenishment rate of ground water tables.

What makes the concretisation problem even worse, at least from the point of view of flooding, is the fact that most Indian cities have built houses but not drains. A government survey carried out in 2010-11 in 104 municipal corporations/Nagar Nigams in large cities found that 56 of them had 50% roads not covered by storm water drainage. Similarly, 745 of 1,383 other urban local bodies (ULB) had less than 50% coverage, and 1,142 ULBs had less than 75% coverage. This is apart from the everyday sight of drains choked with waste or silt where they do exist.

When these problems fester in big cities, it can lead to huge losses. Mumbai‚Äôs 2005 flooding ‚Äî when the city received over 900mm of rain in a single day ‚Äî caused an estimated insurance loss of $0.9 billion, according to a report by Swiss Re Institute. A more recent study by the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and accounting firm KPMG, submitted to the Maharashtra government in September 2019, pegged Mumbai‚Äôs financial losses as a direct consequence of flooding to be ‚Çπ14,000 crore between 2005 and 2015.

Experts fear that the financial damage in Mumbai is only going to increase as the city‚Äôs natural drainage continues to be subsumed by concrete. In 2019, for example, a plush residential township built on the floodplains of the Mothali river in Dombivali, was flooded with water entering the homes of even those living on the first floor, while similar projects built on the floodplains of the Waldhuni and Ulhas rivers have also experienced similar distress in between 2018 and 2021.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has also noticed that the Mithi River took longer to drain its water into the sea this year than during past seasons, leading to apprehension that Mumbai is staring at more floods in the coming years. Officials and experts attributed this to a combination of factors, including heavy rains coinciding with high-tide, and clogging up of drainage channels with muck and garbage. The BMC this year spent a total of ‚Çπ150 crore on its monsoon flood management plan, which showed little to no improvement at fixing the underlying problem.

In fact, rapid development of infrastructure may be creating problems in places where they did not exist earlier. For example, residents reported unprecedented waterlogging in 2020 along the strip of South Mumbai that runs from Worli to Girgaum Chowpatty, allegedly due to the Coastal Road project that has buried about 5km of the intertidal zone along the shore, thus preventing water from draining into the sea.

While New Delhi received heavy downpour, unusual for this time of the year, there has been massive damage to human lives in the southern state of Kerala. On Oct. 17, up to 27 people, including several children, died in rain-related incidents in the birthplace of monsoon in the subcontinent.

Fash floods triggered by heavy rainfall have struck the northeastern state of Assam, too, like those that witnessed in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand only a few months ago.

India Meteorological Department (IMD) has now issued a red alert again for Uttarakhand. It has also forecast ‚Äúlight to heavy‚Äù rain in states such as West Bengal, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh over the next few days.

Recent weather disasters in India

In 2018, all 14 districts of Kerala were affected after once-in-a-century floods left around 400 dead. Nationwide rain-related fatalities reached 1,400. In August that year, landslides left several dead in Himachal Pradesh, another Himalayan state.

Uttarakhand residents still recall in horror the 2013 tragedy, when unusually high rains caused floods that killed over 5,000 people.

Climate change and its effects on India

In the Indian subcontinent, the southwest monsoon, a period of heavy rainfall, usually begins in the first week of June and extends up to August and September, petering out after that. A second, smaller wave of rains, often referred to as ‚Äúretreating monsoon,‚Äù waters some parts of the country in October and November.

In recent years, however, this natural schedule has been messed up thoroughly as seen in the heavy downpour being experienced now in several parts of the country. The intensity of rainfall, too, has smashed conventions.

These changes have caused a huge number of deaths and lakhs of crores of rupees in financial loss, besides draining the nation‚Äôs resources.

Not surprisingly, environmentalists ominously hear climate change banging on the country‚Äôs doors.

A report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicated in August this year that India could face severe and irreversible impacts from climate change. Manifestations could include glacier retreat in the Himalayas, rising sea levels, intense tropical cyclones, flooding, and erratic monsoon.

The Centre has decided to notify the Najafgarh Jheel, the second largest water body in Delhi-NCR after the Yamuna, as a transboundary wetland for its restoration and rejuvenation, according to a report submitted to the National Green Tribunal.

‚ÄúA Framework for Integrated Environment Management Plan (EMP) for Najafgarh Jheel‚Äù will be implemented in a time-bound manner by Delhi and Haryana within the jurisdiction of the respective state, the report said.

Once spread over 226 sq km, the water body straddling Delhi and Gurugram has shrinked to just seven sq km due to rampant encroachment.

The lake is largely filled with sewage from Gurugram and surrounding villages of Delhi.

After Delhi and Haryana prepared their respective environment management plans for the lake, the Union Environment Ministry set up a three-member committee to prepare an integrated EMP.

The panel, comprising Manu Bhatnagar (INTACH), Rajasekhar Ratti, (MoEF&CC) and J. Chandrababu (CPCB), has suggested setting up a ‚ÄúTransboundary Najafgarh Jheel Management Committee‚Äù.

The management committee may have members from the ministry, Central Pollution Control Board, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Nagpur, National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee and representatives of IITs to review the status of implementation of action plans, it said.

The committee that prepared the framework for integrated EMP has suggested demarcating the boundary of the lake using geo-tagged pillars and construction of sluices and ducts on the embankment on the Delhi side.

‚ÄúConstruction on the flood zone around Najafgarh Jheel should be completely prohibited on account of seismic and liquefaction risks,‚Äù it said.

The committee recommended relocating flow obstructions such as power sub-station and providing alternate road connectivity to the settlements at the two ends of the Najafgarh Jheel, thus reducing vehicular traffic on the embankment especially during peak migration season of water birds.

It has suggested putting up signage at entry and exit locations, and at key vantage points to communicate the value of Najafgarh Jheel, management arrangements, and dos and don'ts for people while in the wetland.

The panel has also called for manual removal of water hyacinth and other aquatic invasive species in select pockets of the lake, and developing enterprise for economic utilisation.

Carbon and greenhouse gases flux assessments to determine the role of Najafgarh Jheel in climate change are among other measures suggested by the committee.

The Najafgarh Jheel is a critical natural infrastructure for the region, buffering floods, treating waste water, recharging groundwater (with high potential for water supply to significant population) and providing habitat to numerous plant, animal and bird species.

The presence of 281 bird species, including several threatened ones such as Egyptian vulture, Sarus Crane, Steppe Eagle, Greater Spotted Eagle, Imperial Eagle and those migrating along the Central Asian Flyway has been reported at the lake.

According to INTACH, the revival of the jheel would yield around 20 million gallons of water a day to support a population of 3.5 lakh.

‚ÄúDespite being the source of several benefits and sustaining habitats of diverse species, Najafgarh Jheel has been highly fragmented and transformed, built upon, used as a waste receptacle, and infested with invasive species,‚Äù the committee said.

It noted that the Sahibi river, of which Najafgarh Jheel was the natural floodplain, has been converted virtually into a drain. The decimation of wetlands has exposed the neighbouring settlements in Haryana and Delhi to high risks of pluvial flooding and reduced groundwater levels.

Recent constructions within the wetlands, while impeding natural wetland functions, are precarious owing to high seismicity and liquefaction within the region, it said.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

NEW DELHI, Aug. 4 (Xinhua) -- The floods in India's eastern state of West Bengal have killed 23 lives, local media reports said Wednesday.

The floods were triggered after heavy rains hit several parts of the state, pushing water levels up in the rivers and dams.

Nearly 250,000 people were displaced from their homes following the discharge of water from dams that inundated six districts.

""The flood situation in West Bengal worsened on Wednesday claiming eight more lives taking the toll to 23 as fresh areas went under water,"" a local media report said.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced an ex-gratia relief of 2,695 U.S. dollars to the next of kin of those who lost their lives due to flooding in West Bengal and 673 U.S. dollars to each injured in floods.

Meanwhile, officials said relief and rescue operations were going on in the affected areas.

The panel has also mooted that ‚Äúflood control and management‚Äù should be brought under the concurrent list of the Constitution.

The report of the panel titled, ‚ÄúFlood Management in the Country including International Water Treaties in the field of Water Resource Management with particular reference to Treaty/Agreement entered into with China, Pakistan And Bhutan‚Äù was tabled in both the Houses on Thursday. The panel said NIFMG should be chaired by Union Minister of Jal Shakti with concerned Ministers of the State Governments as the members of it and the group should meet at least once a year. ‚ÄúThe committee recommends that the first meeting of this group should be held within three months of the presentation of this report to the Parliament,‚Äù it said.

Demanding concerted efforts for arriving at a national consensus to place ‚Äúflood control and management‚Äù under concurrent list of the Constitution, the panel said there are practical difficulties in bringing ‚Äòwater‚Äô under the concurrent list, but these have to be resolved for the overall national interest of integrated development of water resources. Quoting the National Commission on Floods, the report said the total area liable to flood in the country is 40 million ha (Mha). ‚ÄúThe total damage to crops, houses and public utilities from the year 1953 to 2018 has been estimated to be about ‚Çπ4,00,097 crore which is a colossal amount. The total human lives lost during this period has been assessed to be around 1,09,374 and around 61,09,628 cattle have also been perished. The high losses and damages caused by floods every year is indicative of poor planning, failure of the flood control policy / measures, inadequate preparedness and ineffective disaster management,‚Äù the report added.

River interlinking

The panel was unhappy to note that despite a National Perspective Plan (NPP) in 1980, no project for interlinking of rivers has been executed so far. It said evolving consensus among the States is the biggest obstacle in the implementation of river interlinking, but urged the Centre to take immediate steps to resolve the hurdles considering the huge losses caused by floods every year and huge benefits accruing out of the interlinking of rivers.

The report also expressed concern over the problem of flooding on account of hydropower projects in Arunachal Pradesh. The report added that any extra water released from these dams uphill lead to enormous inundation of Brahmaputra valley, particularly in Assam. Power projects in Arunachal Pradesh has been constructed without any plan to combat flooding in Assam and the panel urged the Ministry of Jal Shakti to take up the matter with Ministry of Power and Government of Arunachal Pradesh.

The panel asked the Centre to examine the feasibility of making maximum use of the provisions of the Indus Water Treaty, in terms of full utilisation of all accessible water of the eastern rivers and maximum utilisation of the irrigation and hydropower potential of western rivers including permissible water storage as per the provisions of the treaty. The treaty, formulated in 1960s, is not addressing the issues such as climate change, global warming and environmental impact assessment, the panel noted. ‚ÄúIn view of this, there is a need to re-negotiate the treaty so as to establish some kind of institutional structure or legislative framework to address the impact of climate change on water availability in the Indus basin and other challenges which are not covered under the treaty. Hence, the Committee urged the Centre to take necessary diplomatic measures to renegotiate the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan.

Heavy monsoon rains have flooded parts of India‚Äôs capital New Delhi and its suburbs, throwing life out of gear for millions of people, as the death toll from the annual deluge across South Asia rose to nearly 1,300.

In New Delhi‚Äôs suburb of Gurgaon, dubbed the Millenium City, roads, underpasses and residential areas were flooded on Wednesday forcing power cuts in several areas. Rafts were put into action to evacuate people in some areas.

The monsoon is vital to the densely populated region, revitalising land and waterways amid scorching summers. But it also causes widespread death and destruction.

In New Delhi, commuters battled through knee-deep waters and cars and buses were submerged as torrential rains added to traffic woes in the city of 20 million.

Museum flooded

At a museum in Jaipur in the mostly desert state of Rajasthan, staff told AFP how they were forced to smash open a glass display case containing a 2,300-year-old Egyptian mummy in order to save it from rainwater flooding the ground floor.

‚ÄúThe workers broke the glass of the box and took the mummy out‚Äù last Friday after water levels started to rise, Albert Hall Museum superintendent Rakesh Cholak said.

The torrid conditions in recent days also hit India‚Äôs northern and eastern states.

Across India, 847 people have died this season, the home ministry said.

In the southwestern state of Kerala, the death toll from a single landslide rose to 61 on Wednesday, with nine people still missing, an official said.

In India‚Äôs poorest state, Bihar, eight million people have been hit by the floods, with thousands of displaced people sleeping on embankments and highways amid a shortage of relief camps.

Flood disaster

This year‚Äôs rains have also come in the wake of the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus pandemic, with the loss of crops across flood-affected areas a further blow to farmers and rural communities.

In Bangladesh, 226 people have died so far with 40 percent of the country underwater after torrential rain caused rivers to burst their banks and inundate villages.

‚ÄúIn terms of duration it was the second-worst floods in the country‚Äôs history,‚Äù said Arifuzzaman Bhuyan, the head of Bangladesh‚Äôs Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre.

More than six million people have had their homes damaged by the floods, and tens of thousands of villagers remain in shelters, an official from Bangladesh‚Äôs disaster management ministry told AFP.

Others are sleeping in huts built on roads on higher ground, unable to return to their submerged homes.

In flood-hit Rupangar village outside the capital Dhaka, Shahanara Begum said she has been living on the road with her family for more than a month.

‚ÄúIt seems like bad luck doesn‚Äôt leave us. Wherever we go, floodwater follows us,‚Äù the 50-year-old told AFP on Wednesday.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have (previous years) records available for Aya Nagar station. It received very heavy rainfall, as the monsoon trough is passing over Delhi and has shifted towards the south. This is the reason that the southern parts of Delhi and the neighbouring regions received heavy rain,‚Äù said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD‚Äôs regional weather forecasting centre.

The IMD only keeps records for Safdarjung station (considered as representative of Delhi‚Äôs weather) and Palam station.

Going by these, on August 20, 2010, Safdarjung had recorded 110mm rain within a span of 24 hours, which falls in the ‚Äòheavy‚Äô category. This, weather scientists said, was the highest rainfall recorded in the past decade so far.

Rainfall between 64.5 ‚Äì 115.5mm is considered ‚Äúheavy‚Äù rain, while a reading between 115.6 ‚Äì 204.4mm is considered ‚Äúvery heavy‚Äù rain.

Also read: After 80% of season‚Äôs rain in 11 days, HS Puri says Delhi‚Äôs monsoon woes to be over soon

On August 2, 1961, Safdarjung had recorded an all-time high of 184mm rain over 24 hours. Palam‚Äôs all-time record of ‚Äòvery heavy‚Äô rainfall was on August 6, 1963, when it registered 183.6mm of rain over 24 hours.

On Thursday, Palam and Delhi Ridge stations received 89.1mm and 77.3mm rain, respectively, over 24 hours, both considered ‚Äùheavy‚Äù rainfall. The Safdarjung observatory recorded 54.8 mm rain over 24 hours, in the ‚Äùmoderate‚Äù category.

The IMD at 5am Thursday issued an ‚ÄòOrange‚Äô alert, warning of heavy rain in isolated places and predicting moderate rain and thundershowers in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) between 5.30am and 8.30am.

The Orange alert is issued to allow citizens and government agencies to prepare for heavy rain that may cause traffic disruption, increased chance of vehicular accidents and water accumulation in low-lying areas and on roads.

Pul Prahladpur underpass submerged

According to civic agencies and the public works department (PWD), at least 50 spots in the city reported water-logging. Some of the prominent locations where roads were inundated include Pul Prahladpur rail underpass, Bhairon Marg, near Hanuman Mandir Kashmere Gate, Rani Jhansi Road, near Vikas Bhawan ITO, the Ring Road near IP flyover, Maa Anandmayee Marg, Raja Garden flyover, Rohtak Road, Zakhira underpass, Joseph Tito road near Okhla Mandi, Kalkaji, Vikas Marg, Vishwas Nagar, Jhilmil underpass, Jangpura, New Friends Colony, Lal Kuan at Mehrauli-Badarpur Road, Paschim Vihar, and Pitampura, among others.

Images of water-logging at Pul Prahladpur underpass, doing the rounds of social media, showed a cluster bus (orange bus) half submerged. Authorities, however, said no one was trapped in the bus and that there was no casualty.

A senior PWD official said the heavy water-logging at the underpass was due to the unusually heavy rain, coupled with a Delhi Jal Board (DJB) sewer line overflow. ‚ÄúWe have already asked the DJB to fix the sewer line. We have six permanent pumps installed there with a capacity to pump out 7,000 cubic metres of water per hour. It took us a few hours to clear the underpass,‚Äù the official said, requesting anonymity.

Commuters were stuck in traffic on Mathura Road, Ring Road, Vikas Marg, Rohtak Road near Punjabi Bagh, Sarai Kale Khan, BRT Road, Raja Garden, Najafgarh-Uttam Nagar Road, and Tughlakabad among others. In the morning, traffic police had to shut MB Road, due to water-logging at Pul Prahladpur underpass.

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt the authorities fix water-logging issues in the national capital? It‚Äôs a nightmare to drive on inundated roads and one gets stuck in jams for hours,‚Äù Kartik Kumar, a commuter and resident of Maharani Bagh, said.

Civic officials said the incidents of trees falling were also reported from around 35 places in the city. They said incidents of building/roof/wall collapses were reported from at least 10 locations.

Rain deficit made up

IMD‚Äôs Srivastava said the good spell of rain this week has already made up the capital city‚Äôs rain deficit and it is now in the surplus category. Safdarjung now has a surplus rainfall of 15%. Until August 18, it had a deficit of 14%.

The IMD data shows that after this week‚Äôs spell, the rainfall recorded in the month of August touched a surplus of 15%. Parts of west, central and south Delhi, which had received only traces of rain have also made up the deficit. At Palam, the monthly rainfall has reached a surplus of 40% over the past two days.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
delhi,2020,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/new-delhi-minto-bridge-rains-floods-waterlogging-6516140/,21-Jul-20,Explained: Why does Delhi‚Äôs Minto Bridge underpass keep getting flooded?,"Over the years, the picture of the bus stuck under the Minto Road Railway Bridge, which is officially called the Shivaji Bridge, has become an inalienable part of the monsoon in Delhi. The pictures come every year, and a series of governments, scores of engineers and PWD officials, have failed to do anything to stop the waterlogging on one of central Delhi‚Äôs main streets.

What is the problem? Why does the area get waterlogged every year?

As is evident to everyone who has travelled down the road, the underpass below the bridge is a low-lying patch, surrounded on all sides by areas at a higher elevation. This bowl-like depression is a natural receptacle for rainwater, with no outlet for the accumulated pool.

The road meets Connaught Place‚Äôs Outer Circle at one end, Shahjahanabad at the other, DDU Marg on the third, and the New Delhi Railway Station on the fourth. All these areas are at a higher elevation, and the runoff during heavy rain leads to the bowl under the underpass getting inevitably filled.

The Public Works Department has installed pumps ‚Äì temporary and permanent ‚Äì at the site over the years, but a permanent solution has been elusive.

The railway bridge was built in the 1930s after the seat of power of the Raj moved from Calcutta to Delhi. It is a listed heritage structure, so there is little that civic or government agencies can do in terms of redesigning it.

In fact, a plan to demolish the bridge and redesign the area as part of expansion of the New Delhi Railway Station was floated in 2008, ahead of the Commonwealth Games, but it never took off.

Without a redesign, PWD officials say, it is tough to find a permanent solution, given the natural slope of land in that area.

So what happened on Sunday (July 19), the most recent time when Minto Road was flooded?

Last year, the Aam Aadmi Party government had said that the area wasn‚Äôt waterlogged because a drain that has been closed off at DDU Marg, near the BJP headquarters, had been cleared.

Sunday evening, however, showed the relief was only temporary. The PWD, Delhi Jal Board, and the municipal corporations started trading blame in the evening after a man drowned in the water under the bridge.

Government officials said the Covid-19 pandemic had a role to play in Sunday‚Äôs waterlogging, not just at Minto Road but also in other areas in the city. With workforce diverted to sanitise houses and containment zones, and in other Covid-related work, the desilting of drains has been hit, the officials said.

Complaints of waterlogging came from 102 areas across the city, not just Minto Road.

And was this because the rainfall was particularly heavy in Delhi on Sunday?

Advertisement

Delhi got 74.8 mm of rain in a span of around 3 hours on Sunday morning ‚Äî which is pretty heavy.

However, while this was the highest of the season so far (the season has just about begun, though), and also the most rain that the city has experienced in a single day in July since 2015, it was nowhere near the all-time record for the month of July in Delhi.

Advertisement

Thus, in 1958, the city received 266.2 mm of rain in a single day in July. And more recently, in 2013, it got 123.4 mm of rain in a single day in that month.

According to India Meteorological Department (IMD) data, Delhi receives a little less than 30 days of rain through the year. Almost 20 of these days are during the southwest monsoon period.

Also, data show a trend towards isolated, very heavy rainfall events contributing to the bulk of the total precipitation, rather than rainfall spread more evenly over the length of the monsoon season. Thus, 95% of Delhi‚Äôs total monsoon rainfall is recorded in just 99 hours.

OK, the situation at Minto Bridge aside, why do so many other places in Delhi see waterlogging every monsoon?

The primary reason is that Delhi‚Äôs drainage system, which is a combination of old, Raj-era drains and a few newer ones, does not function efficiently. According to an IIT Delhi report on drainage in Delhi, the city has 426.55 km of natural drainage lines and 3,311.54 km of engineered stormwater drains ‚Äî but many are compromised.

According to a report submitted in 2015 by a committee set up by the National Green Tribunal, of the 201 natural drains that existed in the city in 1976, as many as 44 could no longer be traced.

Stormwater drains are largely channels that have been carved up by the natural flow of water. All of them are supposed to eventually lead to Yamuna so that the runoff is deposited into the river. These drains need to carry water uninterrupted when heavy rain occurs.

In the city, however, many of these drains have been blocked, encroached, or built upon. The blocking of the drains for purposes of construction, diverting water, or storing it for treatment does not create a major problem for most of the year because Delhi does not see a lot of rain in the non-monsoon months from October to June.

During the monsoon, however, and especially during a heavy or extreme rainfall event, water accumulates on the roads and in parks. Experts have long said that the best way to avoid flooding during the monsoon is to ensure the drains are allowed to flow unimpeded and take the water to the Yamuna, as they have done for centuries.

The second reason is the concretisation of open spaces.

As footpaths, roads and walkways are concretised, rainwater cannot seep into the ground. This also results in a fall in the water table. While the use of perforated tiles to allow seepage, leaving unpaved surfaces along the roads, and building rainwater harvesting tanks in big buildings and areas was earlier advocated and later mandated, the situation on the ground remains unsatisfactory.

The third reason is that throughout the non-monsoon months, debris and garbage are dumped in the stormwater drains. Desilting is carried out only before the monsoon months, and is hardly ever completed before the rains hit. The accumulated garbage ends up impeding the flow of water.

Cleaning the drains near Minto Bridge. (Express Archive/R K Dayal) Cleaning the drains near Minto Bridge. (Express Archive/R K Dayal)

So what can be the solutions to this situation now?

As Chief Minister in 2012, the late Sheila Dikshit had asked IIT Delhi to prepare a drainage master plan. The draft report was submitted in 2016, and the final report in 2018.

The first challenge for the researchers was to obtain data to work with. According to the report, it took them over 100,000 hours to collect the data needed to create a model for efficient drainage.

This was primarily because of poor maintenance of records, and the multiplicity of agencies. In Delhi, drains are managed by the municipal corporations, the PWD, and the Irrigation and Flood Control Department, along with other smaller agencies. While PWD and the irrigation department come under the state government (now with the AAP), the BJP is in power in the corporations. This makes coordination tougher and shifting blame easier.

During the study, IIT Delhi researchers found, along with other issues, sewage flowing into drains that are meant to carry only runoff ‚Äî either because households did not have sewer connections, or because the Delhi Jal Board, which handles all sewage lines in the city, had punctured holes in sewage lines and diverted the flow into stormwater drains to ease pressure and blockages.

Among the suggestions made in the IIT Delhi report was to make sure that drains are treated as key public assets, and that no encroachments are allowed. It also said that raw, untreated sewage should not be let into drains, and that all stormwater drains should be put under a single agency.

Most of these suggestions remain unimplemented.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

A short but heavy spell of rain on Sunday inundated the underpass yet again, drowning vehicles and killing the 56-year-old driver of a mini truck.

Also read: 56-year-old tempo driver drowns in waterlogged Minto Road underpass

Muktesh Chander, senior IPS officer and a former Delhi traffic police chief, tweeted that he has seen the underpass flooding since his childhood. ‚ÄúSince my childhood I have seen almost every year, photographs of DTC bus submerged in water under Minto bridge during monsoon. Why can‚Äôt engineers, town planners & civic agency officials fix it? Let only one agency, whose name should be prominently displayed there, own & fix it,‚Äù Chander tweeted.

The underbridge lies at the key traffic junction of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya (DDU) Marg and Swami Vivekananda Marg (formerly Minto Road) and leads to Connaught Place on one side and New Delhi station, Old Delhi and Darya Ganj on the other.

Subhash Arya, who was a municipal councillor in the city from 1983 till 2017, said he has seen the underpass flooding since 1947, when he was just a five -year-old. ‚ÄúIt has a deep slope and water from all the approach roads, including Swami Vivekananda Marg as well as from CP, flows into it. It has no outlet.‚Äù

Arya said the underpass was a common flood point then too. ‚ÄúDuring the monsoons, it would get flooded and buses would get trapped. In 1967, the slope was widened to manage the water flow, but it didn‚Äôt help much. In 1980s, the stormwater drains were laid on both sides of the DDU Marg,‚Äù he added.

So, more than 60 years later, why has no agency been able to fix the problem? It is because the bridge is a heritage structure, explained Jagdish Mamgain, who was the works committee chairperson of the erstwhile MCD.

‚ÄúAll one can do is experiment with engineering solutions. The first pump was installed there in 1958, when flooding under the bridge became a huge issue in the municipal House,‚Äù he said.

He added that during the 2010 Commonwealth Games, there was a scheme to add two more tracks to the bridge and level the road from beneath to raise its height, but it did not take off.

In July 2018, when two DTC buses were submerged in the flooded underpass and 10 people had to be rescued, the Delhi High Court had directed all agencies concerned to coordinate efforts and prepare a plan to prevent such instances. A concrete solution to the problem, however, is yet to be found.

Officials in the Public Works Department (PWD), which manages the road, said four suction pumps are installed at the underpass that are ready to be deployed throughout the day. Two of these pumps are in operation while the other two are on standby. ‚ÄúSunday‚Äôs waterlogging seems to have been due a blockage in the main sewer line on DDU Marg. It seems that water came out of the main hose and flooded the road, a low-lying area. A detailed enquiry report will be prepared soon,‚Äù said a senior PWD official, who asked not to be named.

Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who holds interim charge of the PWD portfolio, said, ‚ÄúAt all such points where waterlogging occurs frequently, steps are being taken to fix the issue and prevent waterlogging. All agencies have to work together in this task.‚Äù

The DJB, which manages the sewer line on DDU Marg, said there was no blockage. ‚ÄúHad there been a blockage, the water would not have drained at all. We have inspected the sewer line, no blockage was found. It could only be because of the PWD pumps either not being functional or not being turned on at the right time,‚Äù a senior DJB official said.

Experts said the agencies should prepare in advance since the problem takes place only during monsoon. ‚ÄúOften drivers fail to gauge the depth of water and try to cross over and get trapped. Till the time, a concrete engineering solution is found, all agencies including the traffic police should coordinate efforts and ensure better drainage of the stormwater and divert traffic as soon as the road starts flooding,‚Äù said Sewa Ram, professor and head of transport planning, School of Planning and Architecture.

According to official reports, at least 70 areas -- including residential and market places -- were inundated and a minimum of 10 main road stretches such as Mathura Road, Vikas Marg reported long traffic jams. The civic and road-owning agencies maintained that they made adequate arrangements and promptly pumped out water accumulated on main roads, lanes and streets in the market and residential areas.

Delhi traffic police said that with the overnight shower, traffic was severely hit, especially during the peak rush hours of the morning. The affected stretches included Mathura Road, Ring Road, Vikas Marg, Sarai Kale Khan, Mayapuri, Raja Garden, Najafgarh-Uttam Nagar Road, Pankha Road, Madhuban Chowk among others.

Incidents of tree felling were reported from around 30 places in the city, civic officials said.

A Delhi government spokesperson did not respond to queries regarding the repeated waterlogging and poor drainage in the city.

A senior Public Works Department (PWD) official said water-logging on the Ring Road stretch between IP flyover and WHO building -- one of the worst hit stretches -- occurred due to rain and overflow of a Delhi Jal Board (DJB) sewer line. ‚ÄúA sewer line of the DJB along the Ring Road was probably chocked and overflowed due to heavy rain and the entire stretch was submerged. It also affected traffic movement in the area. We immediately pressed our pumps into service and pumped out the water from the street,‚Äù the official said.

DJB officials, however, said the Ring Road trunk sewer was not choked. They said the 22-km-long line begins from Red Fort Crossing and leads up to Maharani Bagh. ‚ÄúDuring heavy rain, the stormwater enters sewerage system from various locations and it starts overflowing at the lowest topographical point at ITO. Despite maximum pumping at Ring Road station, it takes considerable time to manage,‚Äù the DJB said in a statement.

In Sadar Bazar wholesale market, stormwater entered shops and submerged streets as drains overflowed. Paramjeet Singh Pamma, vice-chairman, Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders, said due to heavy rain not only streets got submerged, the water also entered shops. ‚ÄúIn the morning, when we reached the market there was ankle-deep water inside the shops due to overnight rain. It was because the drains of the area are not cleaned properly. Every monsoon, this situation arises. We have raised this matter with concerned authorities a number of times but there has been no action,‚Äù Pamma said.",flood,Delhi Floods 2023,"Delhi, India",15-07-2023,16-07-2023,"['Mathura Road', 'Vikas Marg', 'Sarai Kale Khan', 'Mayapuri', 'Raja Garden', 'Najafgarh-Uttam Nagar Road', 'Pankha Road', 'Madhuban Chowk']","['100 mm', '150 mm']","['Inundation of residential and market places', 'Traffic jams', 'Tree felling']",0,"['Business disruption', 'Commuting difficulties']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

delhi,2020,https://thewire.in/environment/flood-situation-worsens-in-assam-bihar,27-Jul-20,Flood Situation Worsens in Assam and Bihar; Rain Lashes Delhi,"New Delhi: The flood situation worsened in Assam and Bihar on Sunday with five more deaths and nearly 40 lakh affected people in the two states. Moreover, another spell of monsoon rain lashed Delhi and sultry weather prevailed in Punjab and Haryana.

The five fresh deaths raised the flood-related toll in Assam to 102. Another 26 people have died in landslides triggered by rainfall, the state disaster management authority said.

Over 24.76 lakh people are hit due to floods in 23 districts of Assam.

Goalpara is the worst-hit with over 4.7 lakh affected people.

Union Minister for Development of North Eastern Region Jitendra Singh spoke to Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and assured him that the Centre and the North Eastern Council would help to restore and repair the infrastructure damaged in floods.

Singh said that the central government is constantly monitoring the flood situation in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and other affected states in the northeast.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is taking regular updates on the situation, he added.

In Bihar, at least 10 people have died and 15 lakh have been hit in 11 districts. Nearly 10 lakh were affected by floods till Saturday in 10 districts.

According to the state disaster management authority, Darbhanga is the worst-affected district with 5.36 lakh people either being displaced or trapped inside houses.

Water levels in several rivers such as Baghmati, Burhi Gandak, Kamlabalan, Lalbakeya, Adhwara, Khiroi, Mahananda and Ghaghra have dangerously risen due to incessant rainfall.

Many trains on Muzaffarpur-Narkatiaganj and Samastipur-Darbhanga sections had to change their routes while others had to be terminated, a railway official said.

Meanwhile, a 25-year-old woman gave birth to a baby girl on a National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) rescue boat plying on the swollen Burhi Gandak river in East Champaran district. ‚ÄúThe woman was rescued from her marooned house when she developed severe labour pain and later delivered the baby,‚Äù NDRF officials said.

The mother and the newborn girl have been admitted to a public health facility and they are stable.

A total of 21 NDRF teams are deployed in northern Bihar.

Light-to-moderate rainfall lashed parts of Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath conducted an aerial survey of the areas inundated by heavy rainfall in Gorakhpur district and asked officials to ensure the safety of all dams. He directed the district administration to ensure adequate deployment of boats in flood-affected areas.

The India Meteorological Department said thunderstorms and rain-drenched parts of central and northeast Delhi, Shahdara, Mundaka, Rohini, Bawana and adjoining areas.

Sporadic rains will continue in Delhi-NCR and UP on Monday, the weatherman said.

Both countries blame each other for the floods. The chief ministers of UP and Bihar complain to the prime minister that Nepal was not providing full cooperation on embankment construction for these trans-boundary rivers and their tributaries, even though some of this activity is financed by India.

Nepal, on the other hand, blames India for the flooding of its Tarai plains. It argues that India has constructed roads all along the India-Nepal border without installing adequate drainage. The roads, it contends, act like an embankment and cause submergence of land and villages on Nepal‚Äôs side. A report of a joint India-Nepal technical team that did not find any evidence for this allegation has not been accepted by the Nepali authorities.

A longer term more sustainable approach is needed to address the root causes of the problem. India must cooperate with Nepal on the prevention of soil erosion and reforestation projects including in the Chure (Shiwalik) Hills under the Rashtrapati Chure Conservation Programme, a project under the patronage of the president of Nepal.

More importantly, we need to revive the many reservoir projects agreed upon in the past and whose implementation has been tardy. The Narendra Modi government provided a huge impetus to the Pancheshwar Hydro-Power Project on the Mahakali/Sharda River that had remained stalled for almost two decades since the mid-1990s. Unfortunately, six years down the road, it has got bogged down again, particularly over Nepal‚Äôs refusal to accept India‚Äôs proposal to include the waters of the Lower Sharda Barrage in the existing consumptive usage of the Mahakali waters.

If this issue is not sorted out at the political level, the project will be delayed again at a huge cost. The last time the project was delayed, the overall cost increased from ~12,000 crore to ~40,000 crore even as the total capacity has been reduced from 6,720 MW to 5,040 MW largely due to hydrological factors.

Another priority should be the revival of the Kosi high dam proposal. Though the Kosi Barrage was built several decades ago, and embankment works have proceeded apace, the high dam proposal has not made much progress since its conception in the 1950s. The joint project office has been unable to complete the survey-related work needed for the preparation of the detailed project report (DPR), even though it was set up in 2004, in part due to resistance from local communities. Considerable efforts are needed to address the concerns of the local population, especially in the area that will be submerged. The Nepali authorities are less than supportive on the grounds that the entire submergence will be in Nepal, while the bulk of the benefits in terms of irrigation and flood control will go to India. The Sun Kosi Storage-cum-Diversion Scheme has been made an integral part of the project keeping in mind Nepal‚Äôs interests. An objective and fair system for sharing the costs and benefits from the project will need to be worked out.

So far, India has opted for a bilateral approach. But Bangladesh too is an interested party as the project will regulate water flows into the Ganga and the Padma. Trilateral cooperation will make it easier politically for Nepal to pursue the project. If the project is implemented, an important benefit for Nepal will be the creation of inland waterways along the Ganga and Kosi, which will result in a significant reduction of logistics costs for trade. It will also significantly strengthen sub-regional cooperation. Though relations with Nepal are currently fraught and it is unlikely that solutions will be easily found, India needs to review joint reservoir projects strategically at the political level.

He was looking for the cap of an overhead water tank in his house that the wind had blown away; it was later found floating among trash nearby.

A few metres away, Kripal Singh (45) had put sandbags around his stable for buffaloes, and where a day earlier he had frantically set up a motor to pull out water that was seeping inside. ‚ÄúOtherwise the stable would have collapsed with us and the animals inside. Who‚Äôs going to take responsibility if we die this way?‚Äù Singh said, as village residents gathered around him nodded.

Around them was about 1,000 acres of farmland submerged in a mix of wastewater and rainwater overflowing from the Najafgarh drain since earlier this month, after monsoon showers began, village residents said.

Following Wednesday‚Äôs heavy rain that lashed Gurgaon ‚Äî 158mm in 24 hours ‚Äî water began seeping into homes in Rawta.

‚ÄúThe fields are usually waterlogged around this time every year for the past 20 years, and about 500 acres of land around the drain is submerged in water for all 12 months, but homes had not been affected until now‚Ä¶ People here pray it doesn‚Äôt rain a lot so that their crops are not destroyed,‚Äù said Rajnish Phalswal, a resident.

Farmers said there was no certainty when their fields would dry again, with some estimating weeks or months, and claiming that it all depends on stopping the overflow from drains.

Catfish and other species of fish were being caught in the waterlogged fields on Friday by people from the village and nearby areas, as they kept a watch on snakes in the fields.

At present, the flood department has set up pumps in the area to pull out water collected in the village, and the water levels were reducing as of Saturday afternoon, the official said.

Ramesh Singh (56) estimated that nearly every farmer would have suffered a loss of about Rs 30,000 per acre of field, including their investment and returns on the harvest of about Rs 3,000 per quintal of dhan.

‚ÄúWe would have to stop sowing dhan if this continues. There is also uncertainty about our wheat crops that we sow in November, because even then sometimes water from the drain enters our fields,‚Äù Singh said.

Residents of the village and nearby areas claimed that they have made several representations to government officials and the local MLA and MP, but no steps have been taken to control the problem.

‚ÄúThe solution is building a retainer wall along the drain here to prevent the overflow. Farmers are demanding that they either be compensated or that gram sabha land a little away from the village be handed over to them as it remains dry,‚Äù said Deepak Yadav of nearby Jhuljhuli village.

The problem faced by this village is a result of steps taken after the 1978 floods in Delhi when embankments were built along the Najafgarh drain to prevent the city from flooding in the future, as per an official of the Delhi Irrigation and Flood Control Department.

However, Rawta village lies in a 5.5 kilometre stretch, along the 57-km-long drain, where the embankment was not built by the then Delhi administration.

‚ÄúThe area was supposed to act as a balancing reservoir at the time of floods to prevent the population in dense areas of the city from getting affected. The area around Najafgarh lake is a low lying area, and it was planned at the time that flood water would collect here and not proceed further,‚Äù the official said.

After Wednesday‚Äôs ‚Äútorrential rain‚Äù in Gurgaon, the waterlogged city began pumping out excess rainwater through three drains into the Najafgarh lake and drain, the official said.

At present, the flood department has set up pumps in the area to pull out water collected in the village, and the water levels were reducing as of Saturday afternoon, the official said.

In the long term, the problem would only be solved by talks between Delhi and Haryana, and through the medium of the National Green Tribunal, which is presently hearing a matter to determine whether the Najafgarh lake is a wetland or a private land. ‚ÄúIf the lake is found to be a wetland, then the land of the farmers in Rawta and other villages in Delhi and Haryana would be acquired by the government,‚Äù the official said.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

New Delhi ‚Äî Flooding caused by heavy seasonal rainfall has killed more than 80 people in northeast India. The deluge has forced more than 2.5 million people to flee their homes since May in the state of Assam, known for its lush green tea gardens and a famous wildlife park.

The flood waters have washed away more than 10,000 homes across the state, forcing authorities to set up 300 relief camps in the region. Relief work has been hampered, however, by the rising number of coronavirus cases in the country.

More than 1.1 million people have tested positive for COVID-19 as of Monday, and the disease has killed over 27,000 people in India. In the crowded relief camps, enforcing social distancing and the wearing of masks has proven a challenge for authorities.

Several hundred villages have been completely cut off by the high water, making relief and rescue work even tougher.

Authorities say 85% of Kaziranga National Park in Assam, home to an estimated 2,500 endangered one-horned rhinos, is under water. More than 100 animals, including nine of the rhinos, have drowned in the floods as of Monday, according to park authorities. The vast majority of the world's surviving one-horned rhinos live in Kaziranga.

A one horned rhinoceros and a calf wade through flood water at the Pobitora wildlife sanctuary in Pobitora, Morigaon district, Assam, India, July 16, 2020. Flooding has also inundated most of nearby Kaziranga National Park, home to an estimated 2,500 rare one-horned rhinos. Anupam Nath/AP

Officials said wild buffaloes, wild boar, swamp deer and hog deer were among the other animals found dead.

The flooding has pushed the national park's wildlife up onto elevated roads and closer to humans in the area. Authorities tweeted video of rangers and police guiding traffic around one of the rhinos after it appeared to lay down in exhaustion on a busy road near the park over the weekend.

""I can say that it's one of the worst floods in the state and in the park in the recent times,"" Assam Forest Minister Parimal Suklabaidya told the AFP news agency.

The Assam government said on Monday that the Brahmaputra river ‚Äî known as the ""Sorrow of Assam"" for its tendency to burst its banks and flood surrounding villages ‚Äî was running ""above danger mark"" in 24 of the state's 33 districts.

The river, which flows through Tibet, Bangladesh and India, first breached its banks in Assam last month, flooding large swaths of the state.

That toll includes 67 deaths and 2.6 million people who have been displaced in Bangladesh.

It is a loose federation of artists who get together to make films.

I‚Äôm talking substance. India is an idea, poverty is a state of mind ‚Äî what is this? Speak sense.‚Äù

But first to Republic TV where, Arnab Goswami, was for once distracted: his target was not the Congress and the Gandhi family, nor was it the coronavirus ‚Äî it was the existence of a #BollywoodLobby. Following actor Kangana Ranaut‚Äôs interview with Goswami Saturday in which she accused the industry‚Äôs top brass of ‚Äòsystematically‚Äô killing Sushant Singh Rajput, Goswami decided to capitalise on this ‚Äî also, Rajput‚Äôs movie will be released posthumously next week.

New Delhi: Prime time debates Sunday, for a change, displayed remarkable variety ‚Äî from pigs roaming freely in a Karnataka hospital to rainwater gushing out a hospital‚Äôs roof, from the floods in Assam floods to actor Sushant Singh Rajput. Times Now‚Äòs Athar Khan came down heavily on the quality of healthcare in two BJP-ruled states ‚Äî Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh ‚Äî by saying Covid has exposed India‚Äôs poor medicare, while Aaj Tak wanted to know who was to blame for Delhi‚Äôs heavy four-hour spell in which houses were destroyed and one person died.

Over on Times Now, anchor Athar Khan showed videos of pigs roaming about in a Karnataka hospital and of rainwater bursting through the roof of a UP hospital in Bareilly, before grilling his panelists.

He asked Harish Bijoor, a brand expert, whether the pigs incident has ‚Äúblown the lid‚Äù on Karnataka‚Äôs poor health infrastructure. Why it became an issue of branding, we aren‚Äôt sure, but anyway, Bijoor pointed out, ‚ÄúYou might find this occurring literally every other day. It‚Äôs now coming to the fore because all eyes are hooked on Covid.‚Äù

BJP spokesperson Anila Singh was reassuring: ‚ÄúThe state governments are doing their job‚Ä¶this has happened due to laxity of hospital management‚Äù. Clearly, a case of whose pig is it, anyway.

Mirror Now‚Äòs Afrida Rahman Ali travelled, metaphorically, to Assam in a debate that questioned if the state government had learnt anything given that the floods are an annual occurrence.

Guwahati journalist Sushanta Talukdar pointed out that the Assam government hasn‚Äôt changed its way of dealing with floods in decades. ‚ÄúThe flood-affected people have been held hostage by the faulty approach to the problem,‚Äù he added.

Assam-based environmentalist Rituraj Phukan explained that the roots of the problem are interconnected. Changing rainfall patterns combined with deforestation ‚Äúmake the floods become more and more intense,‚Äù he said.

On NDTV India‚Äòs ‚ÄòHum Log‚Äô, Naghma Sahar started off with the scoop of the century ‚Äî the news that MLAs of Ashok Gehlot camp in Jaipur‚Äôs Fairmont hotel are spending their time watching Mughal-e-Azam and Lagaan. ‚ÄúHowever, the political game of Pilot vs Gehlot is still on‚Äù, she added.

Newly-elected party chief in Rajasthan Govind Singh Dotasra assured her that Congress had the numbers and the BJP‚Äôs ‚Äúpolitical conspiracy‚Äù would not be fulfilled, while political analyst Shubhrastha said that the Congress party is imploding and exploding, and if the BJP is being blamed for the same, it only shows the immaturity of the Congress.

Meanwhile, Delhi finally got some much-needed rain, but it proved to be too much for the city‚Äôs infrastructure. On Aaj Tak‚Äôs ‚ÄòHalla Bol‚Äô, titled ‚ÄòGayi Delhi Pani Mein‚Äô (Delhi got washed away), anchor Chitra Tripathi landed a punch with her comments, ‚ÄúWhen we are talking about Aatmanirbhar Bharat, we‚Äôre aspiring to go on Mars and the Moon, a person died and homes were swept away due to heavy rains!‚Äù

Political analyst Ashutosh said the Delhi government is directly responsible for this. ‚ÄúIf the government is saying that everyone was busy with corona and that is why the situation couldn‚Äôt be handled, it is an excuse,‚Äù he added.

Congress leader Alka Lamba termed the situation shameful and asked why the drains were not cleaned despite the lockdown being lifted on 1 June itself.

Such a consequence has well been discussed in the Indian media for quite some time now. The hawks in India had been advocating to firstly starve Pakistan of water by ‚Äòstopping it‚Äô and then flooding the country by ‚Äòreleasing‚Äô it.

But this plan seems to have run into rough weather, as China which has been equally irked by India‚Äôs move, and which in the past one year has taken the Kashmir issue to the United Nations along with Pakistan thrice, is now hand-in-hand with Islamabad.

Their joint war against India has been brewing for around six months, after a skirmish occurred in which India lost 20 of its soldiers fighting against China on the Ladakh border on June 15.

It is learned that if India goes ahead with its plan, then China would rescue Pakistan. While India tries to choke Pakistan by blocking the waters, China will flood India by releasing the waters from Brahmaputra Dam in Tibet.

The diabolic agenda of China has been reported by The Economic Times on November 29, stating that ‚ÄúChina will build a major hydropower project on Brahmaputra river in Tibet‚Äù. Yan Zhiyong, chairman of the Power Construction Corp of China, said China will ‚Äúimplement hydropower exploitation in the downstream of the Yarlung Zangbo River‚Äù (the Tibetan name for the Brahmaputra) and the project could serve to maintain water resources and domestic security.

He also commemorated the occasion by saying that ‚Äúthere is no parallel in history‚Ä¶ it will be a historic opportunity for the Chinese hydropower industry,‚Äù to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the China Society for Hydropower Engineering.

Obviously, this has set the alarm bells ringing in New Delhi, as only two days later, The Economic Times reported that India is considering building a 10 gigawatts (GW) hydropower project in a remote eastern state, purportedly in response to the reports of China constructing dams on a section of the Brahmaputra river.

The river flows from Tibet into India‚Äôs Arunachal Pradesh state and down through Assam to Bangladesh. The Indian authorities are concerned that these Chinese projects could trigger flash floods or create water scarcity.

‚ÄúThe need of the hour is to have a big dam in Arunachal Pradesh to mitigate the adverse impact of the Chinese dam projects,‚Äù T.S. Mehra, a senior official in India‚Äôs Water Ministry, told Reuters.

‚ÄúOur proposal is under consideration at the highest level in the government,‚Äù Mehra said, adding the Indian plan would create a large water storage capacity to offset the impact of Chinese dams on flows.

India has consistently conveyed its views & concerns on China building a dam on Brahmaputra to Chinese authorities as a lower riparian State with considerable established user rights to waters of trans-border rivers. Govt monitors all developments on Brahmaputra River: #MEAIndia pic.twitter.com/myjCzrx9AR ‚Äî All India Radio News (@airnewsalerts) December 3, 2020

‚ÄúFormally, we are telling them (the Chinese) that any project you undertake, should not cause an adverse impact on India. They have given an assurance, but we don‚Äôt know how long their assurance will last,‚Äù Mehra said.

The war has its own portents and it is likely that droughts, destruction of agriculture through floods may be the possible likelihoods considering the belligerence of the contesting sides as India too has ganged up against China-Pakistan by signing BECA with the US.

And it can now be easily speculated that if India goes ahead to choke Pakistan, then China might engineer a drought or foment flash-floods in Arunachal Pradesh, which it calls ‚ÄòSouth Tibet‚Äô, and which might engulf the whole of India‚Äôs Northeast.

It is expected that India will very rapidly expedite its dam proposal as part of its defense strategy, and to counter China, which possesses the required technology that could even create a ‚Äòquake inside water waves‚Äô to inflict maximum damage.

The visit of Chinese defense minister Wei Fenghe to Pakistan during which both countries entered into defense agreements, on December 1, happened with an eye on India, Hindustan Times reported quoting Indian experts on December 2.

But surely it must have been also to contain elements detrimental to Pakistan from the Afghanistan side, which Pakistan would seek from the Afghan Taliban. China has already offered assistance in infrastructure development to the Taliban in exchange for peace, according to Financial Times.

In wake of these developments, it can easily be concluded that through the latest agreement with Pakistan, China is trying to balance the growing India-US military alliance. And since India is well ahead with its proximity with Israel, being also a part of Quad, it is very plausible that China may also equip Pakistan to match up to the Indian standards.

As that would be the only guarantee for ‚Äòsmooth functioning‚Äô of its China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the lifeline project of China, which Europe, the US, as well as India, wish to get killed at the earliest.

Meanwhile, the Turkish defense minister Hulusi Akar on December 2 visited Pakistan to boost defense ties with the country. Turkey has in the past antagonized India for its support to Pakistan over Kashmir. India too is fiercely engaged in the Malabar naval exercises with Australia, Japan, and the US.

No wonder, all developments are leading towards the war, which may be on the anvil these winters while the US‚Äô new president Joseph Biden takes the oath in January 2021.

delhi,2020,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/water/so-just-why-did-hyderabad-flood--73875,07-Oct-20,"So, just why did Hyderabad flood?","The answer lies in the city‚Äôs old design not being in sync with its burgeoning size and population and the shrinking of its water bodies

Urban flooding has become a common occurrence these days in India. A number of metro cities in the country including Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi and Bengaluru have suffered from it.

The latest victim of urban flooding is Hyderabad. The city as well Telangana received unusually excessive rainfall October 13-14, 2020, due to a deep depression that developed in the Bay of Bengal. Heavy damage to property, roads and human lives has been reported.

Hyderabad has a long history of existence. It is more than 400 years old. The population of the city has grown exponentially. It is 10 million today, up from 1 million in 1950 and 0.1 million at the beginning of the 19th century.

Hyderabad is located on the banks of the Musi river. The Himayat Sagar and Osman Sagar dams on the river, supply the water to the city.

Hyderabad has spread in all directions in recent years. New roads, buildings and infrastructure have appeared. New housing colonies have been erected.

There is a lot of difference in the design of urban localities built at the beginning of the last century and today. Earlier, people in urban areas usually walked or cycled. The average width of a colony road used to be less than 10 feet.

Later, in the middle of the 20th century, the width of the colony road widened to accommodate three-wheelers or small cars. Then, the size of the cars increased, causing the width of the colony road to increase to 40 feet.

Today, new colonies in metro cities have roads more than 50 feet wide.

The narrow lanes and roads, meanwhile, become ‚Äòrivers‚Äô when heavy rains due to depressions, cyclones and cloud bursts occur.

The city of Hyderabad has a good gradient. Some places are quite elevated while others are close to the Musi. There is a natural system of flow of water from a high elevated area to a lower one.

This is perfectly illustrated through the system of natural lakes in Hyderabad, locally known as ‚ÄòCheruvu‚Äô in Telugu.

For instance, water from the Ramakrishna area Cheruvu in the northwest transfers to Peerzadiguda Cheruvu, which is in the east via Pedda Cheruvu. Pedda in Telugu means ‚ÄòBig‚Äô. Ironically though, the Cheruvu is now Cinna Cheruvu ie small lake.

I had visited this waterbody in the early 1970s and had seen children swimming in its clean waters. It has shrunk due to encroachment. From Peerzadiguda Cheruvu, the accumulated water goes to the Musi.

With this background, let us define what is urban flooding. The city of Hyderabad doesn‚Äôt usually get flooded due to monsoonal rain, which is spread over a long period.

However, depressions and cyclones are packed with rain water and usually last for a few days or even hours. This results in more water falling over an area in a short span of time.

Cloud bursts are a similar example of a heavy downpour occurring in less than 1-2 hours. Thus, depressions, cyclonic rain and cloud bursts can lead to urban flooding, which is becoming a big concern for all metropolitan cities in India.

Cities are growing in size as well as population. The natural path of water from elevated areas to lower ground is being blocked by new offices, markets, colonies, etc.

The rainwater gets diverted to other routes and follows the roads and lanes of colonies. If the width of the colony road is less, it turns into a flooded river and water may enter houses.

The need is to reduce the catchment areas in every colony so that the amount of water available to flow in a particular lane is considerably reduced.

Solutions for Hyderabad

In the short term, the natural path of water drainage from high altitude to a lower one should be traced. These routes have been blocked or encroached due to rapid urbanisation, with the city becoming a patchwork of lanes and by-lanes, resulting in larger catchment areas.

The idea is to reduce the catchment area, resulting in less amount of accumulation of rainwater. The catchment areas can be redesigned by proper segmentation of colonies in the form of columns and rows. At some locations, the existing buildings need to be relocated.

In the long term, an underground drainage system should be constructed to flush rainwater from any place, whether it is at a high or low elevation, till the final place of discharge, like the Musi river in Hyderabad‚Äôs case.

Since the long-term solution may be costly and time-consuming, it is advisable to use a combination of both, short-term and long-term solutions.

The above recommendations apply to the city of Hyderabad having many lakes that are interconnected due to its topography and geology. This is not valid for other Indian cities.

Delhi gets flooded during the monsoon and sometimes due to western disturbances and needs a different geological approach. The same is the case with Mumbai, which is a coastal city and hence needs a different approach.

The geology of an area is thus an important factor to mitigate the impact of urban flooding.

delhi,2020,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/urbanisation/an-every-monsoon-affair-how-to-tackle-urban-flooding-72558,30-Jul-20,An every monsoon affair: How to tackle urban flooding,"Urbanisation is inevitable as is climate change; the need is for a multi-pronged approach

As the monsoon hit cities, citizens were reminded of the mayhem that usually surrounds urban India around this time, where roads become canals, even if there is moderate rain.

Waterlogging ‚Äî a prelude to urban flooding ‚Äî is a common sight in urban India during the monsoon. Urban flooding has also become increasingly common, as the changing weather pattern resulted in more high intensity rain in fewer rain days.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) increased the problem of waterlogging as pre-monsoon desilting of drains was not carried out in full capacity.

There were several incidences of pluvial flooding in urban areas across India over the past decade. Some of these were a consequence of incessant rain over a day, for example, in Chennai and Mumbai in 2015 and 2005 respectively.

Others were a consequence of high-intensity bursts of downpour for three to six hours, suddenly overwhelming drainage systems. The trend of urban flooding and waterlogging has continued in urban India this year too.

July was the wettest month for Mumbai, which received 819 millimetres of rainfall on an average.

The city, however, received 675 mm of rain in the first five days of the month, with 427 mm on July 4, 2020, according to a report by international news channel Al Jazeera. This resulted in widespread flooding of roads and buildings in the city, with motorists wading through knee-deep water.

The National Capital Territory of Delhi received 74.8 mm of rainfall (recorded at Safdarjung) overnight on July 19, said a report by The Hindu newspaper. This resulted in widespread waterlogging in the city.

The downpour resulted in one person losing his life. Apart from that, all major junctions of the city were waterlogged. The city reported over 36 incidences of waterlogging and 14 instances of trees falling.

In addition, more than 10 instances of damage to buildings were reported, according to The Hindu. This included the collapse of over 10 houses in an informal settlement near Delhi‚Äôs ITO area.

Like Delhi, neighbouring Gurugram in Haryana was waterlogged with a 22-36 mm downpour recorded July 22 in some of the district‚Äôs weather stations, reported The Hindu.

Several parts of the city were waterlogged, with residents pointing this out on social media.

While these incidents were covered in the mainstream media, they were not isolated incidents: Most urban areas grapple with waterlogging and urban flooding every monsoon.

Context of urbanisation and climate change

It is important to note urbanisation is an inevitable process and urban areas will continue to grow demographically and spatially.

Cities ‚Äî considered engines of growth ‚Äî contribute more than 65 per cent of the national gross domestic product and provide employment to more than a third of the country.

The collateral damage emerging out of these expanding cities is the result of a breakdown in natural systems.

Urban areas, however, generate high volumes of polluted run-off, often resulting in the breakdown of the urban drainage system. In such a case, even moderate rainfall events can lead to flash floods in low-lying areas and can overwhelm drainage systems of cities.

It is evident that our weather patterns are altered because of global warming. There is evidence of change in some climate extremes based on data gathered from 1950, according to the Inter-governmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC).

In terms of precipitation, it is likely there were statistically significant increases in the number of heavy precipitation events, according to the IPCC.

Projections revealed a significant increase in mean monsoon precipitation of eight per cent and a possible extension of the monsoon period.

Extreme excess and deficient monsoons are projected to intensify, according to a 2006 study published in ResearchGate. In the future, high intensity rain over a few rain days is expected to become normal.

Issues related to urban stormwater management

Deficiencies need to be identified under several structural and non-structural dimensions related to urban stormwater management.

Cities were not planned keeping in mind stormwater management. In most cases, development control regulations in master plans do not provide for run-off control measures.

Also, open spaces and water bodies are victims of ‚Äòplanned‚Äô encroachments. Urban streams and water bodies are compromised for urban land uses. A section of the Barapullah drain in Delhi, for example, is covered to construct a bus depot.

While the current response to urban flooding is limited to the construction of roadside drains, design standards recommended by the Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organisation (CPHEEO) are outdated.

While CPHEEO standards recommend a design according to one or two-year flood levels, drains are not able to accommodate increased run-offs because of more frequent high-intensity rain.

Stormwater drains in cities are generally in poor conditions, with operation and maintenance largely inadequate and ineffective.

Stormwater drains are often choked with municipal solid waste and construction and demolition waste. One such example is the choked drain in south Delhi‚Äôs Taimoor Nagar area, where garbage has piled up over the years.

In terms of non-structural deficiencies, there are no national / state level policy frameworks and / or guidelines for urban stormwater management in India.

Urban infrastructure development missions ‚Äî including the Smart Cities Mission, the Swachh Bharat Mission and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation ‚Äî fail to provide a comprehensive vision and strategy to address issues of urban flooding.

Measures by cities

Several cities in India have attempted to address issues regarding urban stormwater management.

Mumbai launched a state-of-the-art Integrated Flood Warning System (IFLOWS) in June, reported news channel NDTV. The warning system helps identifying imminent floods due to high rainfall or cyclones.

The Chennai Flood Warning System ‚Äî that provides spatial flood warnings for the city ‚Äî was launched in October 2019.

These systems help build resilience and can inform the public and authorities regarding risks. The India Meteorological Department launched the Mausam mobile application that provides rain forecasts including warnings.

The Karnataka government launched the Meghasandesha mobile application, which provides real-time rainfall measurements, along with forecasts for rain, flooding and thunderstorms for capital city Bengaluru.

Delhi has prepared several multi-dimensional strategies to address the issues of urban flooding. The city was the first to have a drainage master plan, prepared by the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.

The Delhi Jal Board also took up the revival of 159 water bodies in the city, along with floodwater harvesting projects in the floodplains of Yamuna. All these measures have multiple economic, environmental, social and urban benefits for the citizens of Delhi.

Both Chennai and Delhi also recommended for properties to implement rainwater harvesting structures as run-off control measures.

The Odisha government‚Äôs housing and urban development department issued an advisory for implementing rainwater harvesting in public parks and open spaces in urban areas across the state.

As knowledge partners, Delhi-based non-profit CSE prepared the Roadmap for implementation of WSUDP: Mainstreaming Rainwater Harvesting in Public Parks and Open Spaces in of Odisha report, which provides several design techniques and pilot case examples.

While these measures look good on paper, they must be followed through by effective implementation, taking operation and maintenance and coordination with stakeholders including architects, planners, hydrologists, groundwater experts, etc, into account.

These strategies must be prepared and implemented with the support and contribution of and the local community.

Recommendations

A systemic change ‚Äî which comprehensively resolves structural and non-structural issues ‚Äî is required to address issues of urban flooding. Some of these recommendations are summarised below:

Water-Sensitive Urban Design and Planning (WSUDP) and a green infrastructure approach for stormwater management: Identification, protect and use of open spaces and water bodies as critical green infrastructure to manage run-off and mitigate urban flooding. This must be done in addition to identification of urban catchments and prioritisation based on level of risk and vulnerability.

Till August 5, Delhi‚Äôs total monsoon rainfall this year was 32% less than the Long Period Average (LPA). While this figure can change ‚Äì rainfall until 30 September is counted as monsoon rainfall ‚Äì it is not very surprising. An HT analysis of India Meteorological Department‚Äôs (IMD) daily rainfall database shows that total rainfall has been declining over the past decade in Delhi. Each grid in this database is a box covering 0.25-degree latitude and longitude and Delhi is approximated by two such grids. Not only has Delhi‚Äôs total rainfall been coming down, the share of heavy rainfall in total rainfall has also come down.

See Chart 1: Delhi‚Äôs rainfall

Given this, what explains the consistent, if not worsening problem of flooding? The answer depends on a multitude of factors, including the intensity of rainfall. This useful metric measures if a given amount of rainfall took place in a small area and over a short period of time or if it was spread over a long time or a large area. Since the gridded data set, which has been used for analysing Delhi‚Äôs rainfall, provides only 24-hour data averaged over two large areas, it is difficult to know from it either the time for which it rained, or whether it rained more in certain parts of the city. Both have implications for water logging. For the same value of total rainfall, water logging can be more severe if the rain is fast and concentrated in a locality. In Delhi‚Äôs case the problem is, nobody knows how and how long it rained.

The 2018 Drainage Master Plan (DMP) report for Delhi prepared by the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, for example, could analyse long-term sub-hourly rainfall for only two stations: Palam and Safdarjung. The report identifies high intensity rainfall events that are likely to repeat in a given time frame. As expected, increasing the time frame raises the chances of the intensity of the rain being higher. Over a five year period, for instance, Palam is likely to encounter a 15-minute rainfall event of 95.84 mm/hour, and Safdarjung 112.22 mm/hour. These numbers were 79.5 mm/hour and 87.2 mm/hour for a two year period. Any plan to prevent water logging or flooding will have to take these numbers into account. Similar numbers will also have to be generated for more parts in the city. Currently, there is not enough information. Delhi currently has 18-20 stations.

National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) guidelines for urban flooding mandate one rainfall measurement station every four square kilometers in Class I, II and III cities. Based on these guidelines, issued in 2010, Delhi would need 371 stations. IMD is in the process of setting up these stations in the next two years, said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general of meteorology at IMD.

Granular information on rainfall is just one part of the story. ‚ÄúAll these things give you just that this much volume of water is coming,‚Äù said AK Gosain, professor at IIT Delhi, who authored the 2018 plan. ‚ÄúWhat is more important is what happens once the rainfall occurs in an area and gets converted into run-off and how the run-off is to be evacuated from the area,‚Äù he explained. Run-off refers to the flow of water on the ground when excess rainwater cannot be absorbed by the ground. This is a function of other factors. For example, more concretisation in an area would mean less water getting absorbed by the ground despite the same intensity of rainfall. This would lead to more run-off and a higher risk of flooding. Similarly, data on drains in an area provides details of source and volume of run-off and the time this water takes to travel through the drains. ‚ÄúThen comes the question of how good your drain is. Is it performing its function that it is supposed to perform? Those questions pertain to the management of the drains,‚Äù Gosain said.

The IIT study accounted for these factors using simulation models to make suggestions for preventing floods in Delhi. It first calculated flood volumes at junctions in the drainage network as it exists. The report found that some drains had abrupt changes in their height or were sloping in a direction that would prevent water from being evacuated . So another scenario calculated flood volumes after correcting these flaws. A third and fourth scenario allowed water bodies and nearby parks to absorb some of the water. These successive steps ‚Äì all low-cost, according to the report ‚Äì themselves led to a reduction in number of junctions that got flooded. Therefore, in addition to monitoring and cleaning of drains, even simple steps such as rejuvenation of water bodies in an area can help in reducing flooding in Delhi.

See Chart 2: Number of junctions flooding under different scenarios for Najafgarh basin

There is a big hurdle in implementing these strategies though ‚Äì the lack of authenticated data. DMP highlighted the massive effort required in collecting digitised data for modeling. The team received erroneous data on connectivity, flow directions, dimensions, etc. and had to make assumptions to render it usable for analysis. This is worrying because the analysis cannot be a one-time exercise. DMP itself suggests that fresh simulations should be performed after verifying the digital data used with the reality on the ground.

‚ÄúMore will is needed on the part of the departments to really join hands and work in an integrated manner.,‚Äù Gosain said. That will be difficult -- the jurisdiction of the storm run-off system in Delhi, according to DMP, is divided between 11 different agencies.

According to the the Central Water Commission‚Äôs update dated August 29, eight dams have overflown including the Tawa dam in MP on the river Narmada; Rengali dam in Odisha on river Brahmani; and Hidkal in Karnataka on Ghataptrabha.

River Mahanadi in parts of Chhattisgarh; Wainganga and Narmada in MP are rising rapidly because of heavy rain forecast for the next two days, CWC said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dangerous situation. Any dam that reaches full reservoir level when monsoon is still underway can be disastrous for districts downstream. The dam operators should have released water gradually and not when it‚Äôs already 100%. Naramada, Mahanadi and Godavari basins are affected. CWC and dam operators should have been aware of the likely inflow and planned release accordingly,‚Äù said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People.

The well-marked low pressure area over West Madhya Pradesh and adjoining East Rajasthan is likely to move west-northwestwards during the next two days, IMD said in its Sunday bulletin.

‚ÄúExtremely heavy rain in Madhya Pradesh and other parts of central India is mainly because of a strong low pressure area over west Madhya Pradesh and east Rajasthan. We are expecting rain to decrease gradually over central India but Gujarat may experience very heavy rains for one more day. Then rains will increase over the northern plains when the monsoon trough shifts northwards around September 2,‚Äù said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.

The western end of the monsoon trough (line of low pressure) lies south to its normal position and its eastern end lies close to foothills of the Himalayas. Under the influence of these systems, widespread and very heavy to extremely heavy rain is likely over Gujarat on August 30 and 31. Widespread rain with very heavy rain is likely over West Madhya Pradesh and north Konkan on August 30 and over Rajasthan on August 30 and 31.

‚ÄúWe are not expecting any low-pressure area to develop next week so we are hoping rain will gradually reduce in central India. Rains may increase over northwest India, northeast India and south Peninsula particularly Kerala-Karnataka region,‚Äù said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at the National Weather Forecasting Centre.

Excess rains could ensure soil moisture for months. ‚ÄúThere are different ways of harvesting water. But the most important source of water for agriculture is groundwater, more than both dams and rivers. So the focus should be on local storage and local recharge systems. We have to store rainwater where it falls and avoid runoff,‚Äù added Thakkar.

Monsoon rain over the country since June 1 has been 9% excess with 21% excess over the southern Peninsula; 19% excess over central India; 11% deficiency over northwest India and 3% over east and northeast India.

According to Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region, a report by the ministry of earth sciences released earlier this year, from 1950 onwards there has been a significant rising trend in the frequency and intensity of extreme and heavy rain events over central India, along with a decreasing trend in moderate rain events.

A study published in Nature journal in 2017 by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology had concluded that there had been a three-fold rise in extreme rains along the west coast and central India during 1950 to 2015",. flood,2019 Madhya Pradesh floods,"Madhya Pradesh, India",27-08-2019,31-08-2019,"['Madhya Pradesh', 'Odisha', 'Gujarat']","['19% excess over central India', '21% excess over the southern Peninsula']","['8 people killed in Madhya Pradesh', '16 people died in flooding in Odisha', '175 people had died because in floods in Gujarat']",['129 since this monsoon'],"['454 villages in 12 districts of Madhya Pradesh have been affected by the floods', '800,000 have been affected across 500 villages of Odisha', '50,000 people evacuated to safe shelters']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Upon running a keyword search, we unearthed an Aaj Tak report about this viral video that was published on September 21, 2019. It stated that the video was shot during the September 2019 floods in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh. Aaj Tak had shared the video and wrote, ‚ÄúHeavy rains have triggered flood-like situation in Prayagraj. On the one hand, where people are compelled to leave their houses as flood water entered their residence, some couples decided to learn swimming.

Another article published on the same date in Rajasthan Patrika also covered the video. It too stated that it was shot in the city of Prayagraj.

On September 22, 2019, news channel India News had broadcast a video report about the couple swimming in floodwater.

Heavy spells of retreating monsoon rains had flooded various parts of Uttar Pradesh in September 2019 which left thousands of people homeless.

An old video clip from Prayagraj was wrongly shared as Delhi. Many users shared the video of a man teaching his wife to swim in their flooded home thinking it was taken recently. A number of senior leaders from the Congress shared the video targetting Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.

‚ÄúOn one hand, people are troubled due to Covid-19 and on the other hand, there are challenges arising out of Assam floods. Still, the people of our state continue to fight the battle. Central and state governments are providing all kinds of assistance to the people,‚Äù he added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Sonowal on Sunday to take stock of the flood, erosion and Covid-19 situation in the state.

‚ÄúThe PM said that the central government was keeping a close watch and standing closely with the people of Assam during these difficult times,‚Äù said a statement from the chief minister‚Äôs office.

According to a Central Water Commission (CWC) bulletin, most rivers in the state continue to be in spate. The Brahmaputra, Dhansiri, Jia Bharali, Kopili, Beki, Kusiyara and Sankosh flowed above the danger mark at several places.

The latest alert from CWC on Monday said that the Brahmaputra is expected to rise more by Tuesday evening. The river had burst its banks two weeks ago, swamping more than 2,500 villages. Goalpara is the worst-hit district with over 4.53 lakh people affected, followed by 3.44 lakh in Barpeta and 3.41 lakh in Morigaon.

Personnel of the State Disaster Response Force, district administrations and locals have rescued 366 persons during the last 24 hours, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said. Over 50,000 people uprooted by floods have taken shelter at 521 relief camps.

The rapidly rising water level has also inundated the Kaziranga National Park, home to the world‚Äôs largest concentration of one-horned rhinoceros, with an estimated 2,500 out of a total population of some 3,000 of the animals.

‚ÄúNine rhinos have drowned and over 100 other animals have been killed,‚Äù said Assam‚Äôs agriculture minister Atul Bora. Sixty other animals (36 hog deer, eight rhinos, three wild buffalo, one python, seven wild boar, two swamp deer, one Sambar and two porcupines) have so far died due to drowning, according to state government.

Assam, famous for its tea plantations, is hit by flooding every rainy season despite flood-control efforts.

Heavy rain triggered floods in a number of regions including Bihar, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and parts of Meghalaya in July; Mumbai, Konkan and Karnataka in the first week of August; and flash floods in parts of Rajasthan on August 15.

Spurts of exceptionally heavy rain have paralysed life like they did this month in Kerala‚Äôs Idukki, where a landslide killed at least 55 people. According to a flood situation report dated August 12 by the ministry of home affairs‚Äô disaster management division, 868 people have lost their lives to floods in 11 states, compared with 908 deaths in the same period last year.

‚ÄúYes, this year we have seen exceptional rains and several cases of extreme weather events. For example, one town in Jaipur district recorded 25 cm rain only in six hours. A lot of rain was recorded last week alone which helped northwest India largely cover its deficiency. Parts of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan have recorded extremely heavy rains in the past 24 hours,‚Äù said RK Jenamani, senior scientist at the National Weather Forecasting Centre.

‚ÄúAugust will see excess rains because another low-pressure area is likely to develop over Bay of Bengal around August 19 which will bring very heavy rains to northwest and central India in the coming days. A fresh low-pressure area is likely to also develop around August 23 but we are not yet certain about that one,‚Äù Jenamani added.

Three low-pressure areas have already developed over the Bay of Bengal in August. These were the main rain producing systems during monsoon. No low-pressure area had formed in July and the monsoon trough (line of low pressure) had frequently oscillated towards the Himalayan foothills, bringing extremely heavy rains to northeastern states.

‚ÄúThe northern Arabian Sea has been anomalously warm during the last several weeks....the sea surface temperatures have been consistently 2-3¬∞C above normal over this region. It has created a mini warm pool over that region, providing additional heat source and moisture,‚Äù said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.

‚ÄúOur research shows that such high temperatures in the north Arabian Sea can lead to episodes of strong monsoon winds ensuing heavy rain spells across several parts of India,‚Äù Koll said.

June had ended with surplus rains of 17.6% while July had closed with a deficit of 9.7%. But the low pressure areas developing in August have intensified rains in the core monsoon region‚Äîparts of central and east India. According to IMD‚Äôs Sunday bulletin, parts of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Konkan and Goa recorded very heavy to extremely heavy rains on Saturday and Sunday morning.

For example, Bhopalpatnam and Bhairamgarh 22 cm, recorded 32 cm and 22 cm of rain respectively; and Sama 27 cm and Bijapur 23 cm. All are located in Chhattisgarh,

The monsoon trough is active and lies south of its normal position (Ganganagar to Bay of Bengal.) Its western end is likely to move northwards during the next two days. A cyclonic circulation lies over south Punjab. Convergence of strong moist south-westerly winds from the Arabian sea over the plains of northwest India is likely to further strengthen from August 18 onwards.

Because of these conditions, increased rainfall is likely over northwest India from August 18 with widespread and heavy rains over the region and Uttarakhand. Extremely heavy rain is likely over west Rajasthan and Uttarakhand on August 18 and over north Punjab on August 19.

Extremely heavy rain is also likely over Telangana, Konkan, Goa, Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh, and the ghat areas of madhya Maharashtra on Sunday and Monday. Due to the likely formation of a low-pressure area, heavy to very heavy rain is likely over Odisha and Gangetic West Bengal also on August 18 and 19, IMD‚Äôs Sunday bulletin said.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a red alert for Kerala‚Äôs high-range Idukki district with a forecast of widespread extremely heavy showers.

However, a fresh spell of rains brought relief to the national capital from the sultry weather but caused waterlogging in low-lying areas, affecting traffic movement, electricity and water supply.

Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the IMD‚Äôs regional forecasting centre, said, ‚ÄúThe monsoon trough will be close to Delhi-NCR from Tuesday evening to Thursday.‚Äù

‚ÄúDuring this period, southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea and easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal will reach Haryana, Delhi-NCR, West Uttar Pradesh and northeast Rajasthan,‚Äù he said, adding that under the influence of these systems, heavy to very heavy rainfall will occur over these areas.

In Assam, three people drowned in floodwater and close to 17 lakh people across 21 districts remained affected by the deluge despite an improvement in the flood situation across the state, according to an official bulletin on Wednesday.

Till Tuesday, more than 19.81 lakh people were suffering due to the deluge across 21 districts.

A daily flood report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) stated that one person each drowned in Barpeta, Kokrajhar and Kamrup districts.

With this, the total number of people losing their lives in this year‚Äôs flood and landslide across the state has gone up to 133, of whom 107 were killed in flood-related incidents and 26 died due to landslides.

The ASDMA said that over 16.55 lakh people were hit by floods in Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Darrang, Baksa, Barpeta, Chirang, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, South Salmara, Goalpara, Kamrup, Kamrup Metropolitan, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat, Jorhat, Majuli, Sivasagar and Dibrugarh districts.

Goalpara is the worst-hit with over 4.19 lakh affected people, followed by Morigaon with more than 2.63 lakh people and South Salmara with around 2.50 lakh people hit by the deluge.

At present, 1,536 villages are inundated and 92,899.95 hectares of crop area has been devastated across Assam, the ASDMA said.

The death toll due to the flood in Bihar rose to 11 with three fresh fatalities while the number of people affected by the calamity reached close to 40 lakh, the state disaster management department said.

All the three deaths were reported from Darbhanga district, it said.

The number of people affected by the floods, caused by heavy rainfalls in catchment areas along the Indo-Nepal border, has now reached 38.47 lakh. Residents of nearly a thousand villages across 12 districts of Bihar have been hit by the calamity.

Heavy rain forecast in north Bengal

Meanwhile, heavy rain has been forecast in all north Bengal districts, which got a day‚Äôs respite from the continuous showers that lead to a flood-like situation.

Little or no rain was recorded in the 24 hours till 8.30 am in the region, where heavy downpour has caused flooding of low-lying areas in some districts, including Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar.

The meteorological department has warned of heavy rain or moderate thunderstorms in Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Coochbehar, North Dinajpur and South Dinajpur districts till Friday morning.

Many parts of Kerala waterlogged

Down south, several parts of Kerala ‚Äì particularly Ernakulam and Kottayam districts have been receiving heavy rains since Tuesday night. In Kochi, the busy Jos junction, M G Road, Panampilly Nagar, Palarivattom and other main roads were waterlogged.

Rain fury in Kochi‚Äôs neighbouring Kottayam district led to landslides which affected train services between Kottayam and Chingavanam.

Railway sources said that earth and boulders piled up on railway track on Wednesday morning, affecting train services between Kottayam and Ernakulam.

Till 8.30 am, Kottayam received 20 cm showers of rain, Vaikom 19 cm, Chertala 18 cm, Ernakulam South 13 cm, Kochi airport 15.42 cm, and Thiruvananthapuram city 4.82 cm.

With the forecast of extremely heavy rains, there are chances of landslides, earth slips, floods and other natural disasters, the Kerala Disaster management authority said and asked people to maintain extreme caution.

As 40-50 km/h wind likely to prevail along and off the Kerala coast, fishermen have been asked not to venture out in the sea. One of the two fishermen from Tirur in Malappuram who had gone missing on Tuesday evening was rescued after 14 hours and search for the other was underway.

In the northern region, Uttar Pradesh witnessed light to moderate rains at most places in eastern and western parts in the last 24 hours and more showers along with thunderstorm are likely to occur on Thursday.

However, sultry weather conditions continued in Haryana and Punjab with maximum temperatures hovering slightly above normal limits.

Monsoon has remained subdued in the two states for nearly a week now.

In what could be deemed as a case of political discrimination, the Centre has excluded Kerala from a calamity relief of ‚Çπ5,908 crore released to seven States on Monday. Kerala was one State that was battered by heavy flood in two successive years, 2018 and 2019, and is still struggling to source funds for rehabilitation of the victims.

The decision for releasing the additional assistance from the National Disaster Relief Fund was made after a high-level committee meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi. A majority of the beneficiaries of the latest release are Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled States such as Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tripura, and Assam. Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh too have got their due from the additional assistance cleared after the meeting.

State government officials at the Secretariat or the Resident Commissioner in Delhi are yet to get any response from the Centre to the State‚Äôs repeated pleas for funds, government sources said.

Earlier, a sum of ‚Çπ3,000 crore was sanctioned, against a demand for ‚Çπ5,000 crore, after the first bout of floods hit the State.

Last year‚Äôs flood

The Centre has not sanctioned any major relief after the flood wreaked extensive damage in the State last year, sources said.

The decision comes soon after the Centre rejected the design for a carnival float the State had presented for the Republic Day parade in Delhi. Kerala had been in the forefront of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 agitations and the Kerala Assembly had passed a resolution against it.

This may have prompted the Centre to ignore the State‚Äôs plea for more funds for rehabilitating flood victims, sources said.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Jagan Chapagain, Secretary General, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said: ‚ÄúMillions of people across Bangladesh, India and Nepal have been marooned, their homes damaged and crops destroyed by floods that are the worst in recent years.

‚ÄúEvery year there are monsoon floods, but this year is different as it comes at the height of a deadly COVID-19 global pandemic. Tragically, already 550 people have lost their lives and more than 9.6 million people have been swamped across South Asia.‚Äù

Close to one third of Bangladesh has already been flooded with forecasts of worse flooding in the coming days. More than 2.8 million people have been affected, including over 1 million who remain isolated and surrounded by floodwaters, according to the Bangladesh Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief.

In India, more than 6.8 million people have been affected by severe floods, mainly in the northern states of Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Meghalaya bordering Bangladesh, according to the Indian National Emergency Response Centre.

In Nepal, flooding and landslides have already killed close to 110 people. Across India, Bangladesh and Nepal, 550 have died according to government figures. Millions have been displaced from their homes.

Mr Chapagain said: ‚ÄúPeople in Bangladesh, India and Nepal are sandwiched in a triple disaster of flooding, the coronavirus and an associated socioeconomic crisis of loss of livelihoods and jobs. Flooding of farm lands and destruction of crops can push millions of people, already badly impacted by the COVID-19, further into poverty.‚Äù

IFRC has released more than 800,000 Swiss francs (850,000 US dollars) to support Bangladesh Red Crescent relief activities, including more than 230,000 Swiss francs released last month when flood forecasts signalled the extent of the potential impact.

Volunteers in India, Bangladesh and Nepal are helping with shelter, providing tarpaulins, dry food and hygiene kits, and installing pumps for safe water. In Bangladesh, Red Crescent teams have distributed cash grants to help more than 35,000 people cope with the flooding. In India, over 9,200 tarpaulins have been distributed to most at-risk families. In Nepal, Red Cross teams are airlifting relief supplies to communities that cannot be reached by road.

Many communities in Bangladesh and India are still recovering after Cyclone Amphan damaged or destroyed more than 260,000 homes, crops and infrastructure, two months ago.

Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and Gurugram Metropolitan Development (GMDA) officials have attributed the delay behind monsoon preparedness to the raging Covid-19 outbreak. The draining cleaning operations started only in June because of the pandemic.

GMDA looks after all master drains in the city, while the MCG takes care of the arterial ones.

A master drain carries the sewage of more than one sector or a neighbourhood, while an arterial drain is a network of pipelines in a residential colony or a sector.

Earlier on March 21, MCG officials were instructed to take care of basic civic amenities and put a stop all other work owing to the Covid-19 outbreak.

Later, though the civic authorities turned their attention to the cleaning of drains in mid-April, however, work didn‚Äôt get underway until June. It was a case of too little, too late.

Too little time left, too much to do

Usually, any cleaning operation for a drain takes about two months, including desilting, ahead of the monsoon season.

Typically, MCG and GMDA authorities float tenders for cleaning the drains in March and April, and by May, the work is at an advanced stage.

But the civic bodies‚Äô plans came unstuck this year because of the unprecedented Covid-19 outbreak. MCG authorities floated the first set of tenders in May. While GMDA authorities followed suit and got into the act in early June.

GMDA had to do the heavy-lifting for crucial stretches such as IFFCO Chowk-Rajiv Chowk, areas along the Delhi-Gurgugram Expressway, Subhash Chowk-Vatika Chowk on Sohna Road, Bakhtawar Chowk-Subhash Chowk in Sector 34, and near Hero Honda Chowk.

The civic body was found wanting in the end.

Acute manpower crunch

It takes at least three weeks to award a contract. However, amid the Covid-19-triggered hard times, the contractors faced an acute shortage of manpower, as most of the migrant workers had left for their native places in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh following the nationwide lockdown restrictions that were enforced from March 25 to contain the spread of the contagion.

Contractors‚Äô manpower strength was reduced to 30%. Consequently, the work progressed at a snail‚Äôs pace amid a looming monsoon.

No outlet for rainwater

The drainage system in Gurugram leaves a lot to be desired, as was evident from the flooding of seven underpasses on Wednesday.

Every year, the Haryana Urban Development Authority‚Äôs (HUDA) master drainage lines either get choked at critical points or are bursting at their seams during monsoon. There is no outlet for the accumulating rainwater to be released. Raman Sharma, chief engineer, MCG, said most of the rainwater flowed back into Gurugram due to lack of outlet, flooding the satellite town‚Äôs thoroughfares and residential areas.

Blocked natural drains

Gurugram of the 1980s was a pristine landscape, dotted with ‚Äújheels‚Äù, or water bodies in the low-lying parts of what has since morphed into a millennium city with its distinctive skyline of glitzy skyscrapers and glass-fronted offices and trendy shopping malls. The water bodies in the Aravallis were ideal to drain the rainwater. Rapid urbanisation through the 1990s and the turn of the new millennium led to blockage of natural drains.

A land revenue record from 1956 showed Gurugram had around 640 water bodies, which has since whittled down to 251 in 2018-19.

And, there hangs the tale of the annual flooding woes of the Millennium City.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

‚ÄúWhat we saw this time is a worrying trend. SSD couldn‚Äôt ration its water release based on information of extreme rainfall in the Narmada catchment area. There was large scale devastation primarily because of sudden water release by the dam. Hundreds of people had to be shifted from Bharuch and Vadodara districts during the flooding.

I fear that more such dam generated floods will affect the region in the future,‚Äù said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator, SANDRP, and an engineer, who was earlier associated with the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA). The analysis suggests that though no water was released by the dam after extremely heavy rains started in the Narmada valley districts, the dam started releasing up to 10 lakh cusecs from the night of August 29.

‚ÄúThree days later, on September 1, they closed most of the spillway gates, which reduced releases from spillway to less than a tenth of the earlier figure. From August 29 to September 1, massive quantities were released, up to 30, 000 cumecs through spillways, and almost nothing before or after. It created massive flood disasters all along the downstream from Gaudeshwar to Chandod to Bharuch,‚Äù Thakkar said.

SANDRP, in its analysis published on their website, said the SSD authorities might have ignored both Central Water Commission‚Äôs (CWC) warnings and IMD‚Äôs rainfall forecast.

The first heavy spell of rainfall in the Narmada basin had occurred between August 16 and 18, followed by more precipitation on August 21 and 22.

However, an exceptionally heavy spell of rainfall was recorded from August 26 onwards.

On August 27, Madhya Pradesh‚Äôs (MP) Narsinghpur had recorded 152.6 millimetres (mm); Raisen (110.5 mm); Hoshangabad (81.8 mm); and the following day Betul recorded (142.4 mm); Harda ( 111.1 mm); and Hoshangabad (191.1 mm).

On August 28, the CWC in its flood forecast had also warned that the SSD was expected to receive increased flows due to very heavy rainfall in the past three days leading to a rise in the water level of Narmada, Mahi, Sabarmati and rivers flowing in the westward direction in Gujarat. CWC had tweeted on September 1 that ‚Äúheavy inflows are still continuing at Indirasagar, Omkareshwar and SSD. Releases from SSD gave rise to severe flooding situation at Garudeshwar in Narmada and Bharuch districts.‚Äù

SSD is one of the largest water resources projects in the country that covers four major states such as Maharashtra, MP, Gujarat and Rajasthan.

‚ÄúAt the outset, let me make it clear that SANDRP is quite known for its anti-dam stand in general and anti-SSD in particular,‚Äù said MB Joshi, chief general manager (technical & coordination), Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited.

The 1,163-kilometre (km) stretch of river Narmada -- from its source at Amarkantak to SSD ‚Äì had recorded heavy rainfall from August 20 to September 1.

Around 14,660 million cubic metres of water were received at Indira Sagar as against its live storage capacity of 9,745 million cubic metres. Indira Sagar is the largest dam in the Narmada river basin, according to SSD authorities.

SSD had to negotiate huge releases of water from the upstream major dams such as Omkareshwar and Indira Sagar because of heavy rainfall.

‚ÄúKeeping in view the safety of the dam as well as the people in Bharuch city and about 30 villages on the banks of Narmada, the reservoir was operated in a scientific way following the established principles of flood routing in major dams,‚Äù the SSD said.

The SSD authorities cited that SANDRP‚Äôs report is factually incorrect because no water was released by the barrage until August 29. The River Bed Power House (RBPH) operation was started from midnight on August 25 and it gradually gained momentum.

‚ÄúEfficacy of SSD in flood control is evident from the fact that despite continuous heavy inflow of over 10 lakh cusecs of water received for about 62 hours -- between 6 pm on August 30 to 11 pm on September 1 -- spillway release of more than 10 lakh cusecs could be restricted after 21 hours,‚Äù and ‚Äúinflow at Sardar Sarovar went up to as high as 12.06 lakh cusec on August 31. However, the maximum spillway discharge released was 10.74 lakh cusec after considering the fact that any release from the dam further gets added due to flow from tributaries joining in the downstream,‚Äù the SSD authorities said.

Four retired Gujarat government officials, including two chief engineers and a secretary of the Gujarat government, responded to SANDRP‚Äôs analysis in the Counterview portal.

‚ÄúSome well-known activists, who are anti-dam in general and anti-Sardar Sarovar in particular, have been still attempting to curse the SSD and its project authorities by making false allegations of having created ‚Äòavoidable flood disaster‚Äô. Instead of allowing the public in the downstream areas to share their experience of having a great sigh of relief this year amid very heavy rainfall in the Narmada basin, factually incorrect information is being deliberately disseminated,‚Äù they argued against SANDRP‚Äôs assertions.",flood,2021 Gujarat Floods,"Gujarat, India","August 26, 2021","September 1, 2021",Bharuch and Vadodara districts,"152.6 mm (Narsinghpur, MP) on August 27",Hundreds of people had to be shifted from Bharuch and Vadodara districts,No deaths reported,Severe flooding situation at Garudeshwar in Narmada and Bharuch districts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Very intense development seen over west coast with monsoon vigorous on North Konkan, said IMD Mumbai centre's deputy director general K.S. Hosalikar on Twitter on Wednesday. He further said that Mumbai, Thane, Raigad and Palghar and also the ghat areas of Maharashtra will receive extremely heavy rainfall in next 24 hours.





He said Mumbai already recorded rainfall of 100 mm within six hours on Wednesday.

Hosalikar said Mumbai, Thane rainfall in six hours since Wednesday morning indicate at isolated places the recorded values are between 70-100 mm and other places its 40+ mm.

He said rains are going to continue with moderate to heavy spells across and that red alert has been issued for Mumbai, Palghar, Thane and Raigad.

Dahanu in Palghar recorded over 350 mm rainfall in the 12-hour period ending at 5.30 am on Wednesday while some areas in Thane received over 150 mm during the period, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, and predicted more intense showers during the day.

Water-logging was reported in low lying areas of Chembur, Parel, Hindmata, Wadala and other areas of Mumbai.

""The cloud activity indicates that there would be one more intense rainfall day on Wednesday,"" Hosalikar tweeted.

""Heavy to very heavy with isolated extremely heavy rains possible in next 24 over entire Konkan region. In North Konkan the impact could be more including Thane, Mumbai and Palghar,"" he said.

Parts of south Madhya Maharashtra and adjoining Marathwada region are also likely to get very heavy rainfall, along with intense spells, he said.

""With formation of low pressure area on Tuesday in North Bay, as forecast by the IMD, it has resulted into strengthening of lower level southerly winds over Arabian sea. It has brought heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places in and around Mumbai, Hosalikar said.

The Pune district also received 59 mm rainfall in the last 24 hours and it is likely to witness moderate to isolated heavy showers in next two days, an IMD official said.

The catchment areas of four dams - Varasgaon, Khadakwasla, Panshet and Temghar which provide water to the city - received good rainfall.

Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said since good rainfall is predicted by the IMD, the city is not likely to face any water cuts till the Ganesh festival, which begins on August 22.

Time was running out but Mohfisur Rehman did not lose hope and reached out from distant Assam to doctors in Delhi to give Lalchand Biswas, suffering from acute liver failure, a fresh lease of life.

In a heroic tale of floods and friendship beyond religious boundaries amid a pandemic, the pharmacist put his stranded friend in a small boat, brought him to an area of Assam‚Äôs Morigaon town where the mobile signal was strong and set up a web conference with doctors at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here. In dramatic scenes that could be straight from a film, Rehman then proceeded to follow the doctor‚Äôs instructions, using his training as a pharmacist to do a physical examination, give his friend injections and even an enema all from the small boat. ""We thought we would lose him. His condition was really deteriorating. His family cannot speak in Hindi or English, so I offered to help them and contacted the doctor at Ganga Ram. I did what a friend in need would do. Our religion is immaterial, humanity matters,"" Rehman, thankful to doctors at SGRH, told PTI from Morigaon.

""In that moment, I felt like a doctor doing his duty,"" the 35-year-old said. Recounting the emergency rescue mission for Biswas, whose liver cirrhosis had developed into liver failure, officials at SGRH on Thursday said the distress call came about two weeks ago. The call was to Dr Ushast Dhir, consultant in the Department of Surgical Gastroenterology and Liver Transplant.

Rehman described the symptoms and told him ""the patient was drowsy, having difficulty in breathing and had swelling in abdomen"", a senior official said. Dhir, with support from his colleagues, made arrangements for a ""quick medical consultation‚Äù through tele-conferencing. ""The patient was brought by a boat to an area where mobile phone signal was catching.

The entire web-conference was done on the small boat,"" the official said. One big hurdle was the language barrier as Biswas could not communicate with the doctors. Rehman stepped in to translate. Rehman was not very familiar with administering injections and an enema but closely followed what the doctor was saying. ""Rehman's degree in pharmacy came handy in this situation. He followed the instructions given by Dr Dhir and did clinical examinations and administered injections to his friend,"" the official said.

Within an hour, a repeat link was established to check Biswas‚Äô condition. He had thankfully stabilised by then. Biswas, who is in his 40s, will be called to Delhi for further medical treatment once the situation stabilises, hospital authorities said. ""The floods in Assam have brought life to a standstill... But in these challenging times there are these stories of courage, friendship and communal unity that offer us a glimmer of hope,"" the hospital said in a statement.

Reports and visuals of people suffering the floods in the northeastern state have given a glimpse of the suffering of the people. The hospital said medical advice and drugs to the patient were provided free of cost.

""The patient was not only given medical advice but the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital also arranged and ensured that life-saving medicines for a one-month course reached the patient,"" Dhir said. According to D S Rana, chairperson (Board of Management), SGRH, ""Our hospital follows the ideals of Sir Ganga Ram, who was always in the forefront to help needy patients, irrespective of region, religion and their financial conditions. This was one more such step in that direction.

At least 16 people have been killed in incidents of wall and house collapses amid record rains in southern India, officials and media reports said.

Nine people died in the city of Hyderabad after a perimeter wall collapsed and fell on a set of houses during heavy rains Tuesday night, regional legislator Asaduddin Owaisi said on Twitter. Indian media reports said the dead included a two-month-old infant.

Five other people, including an old couple and their grandson, were killed when two other house collapsed during the downpour in the city, police said. Two other persons were swept away by floodwaters, the Associated Press reported.

Daily life has been thrown out of gear across parts of Hyderabad as roads are flooded and vehicles washed away in several neighbourhoods.

Telangana, where Hyderabad is located, and neighbouring Andhra Pradesh states have witnessed heavy rains for the last three days caused by a deep depression in the Bay of Bengal.

A total of 18 people have died in the region since Monday, Indian media reports said.

Hyderabad received 25cm (10 inches) of rain in the past 24 hours, the highest in over 20 years, the Indian Metereological Department officials said, according to the Times of India newspaper.

The death toll from floods in Assam rose to 66 on Wednesday as six more people drowned. The deluge has affected over 3.5 million people and submerged around 90% of the Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve.

The Central Water Commission on Wednesday said 52 stations in Bihar, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, and Arunachal Pradesh have reported severe flood and above normal flood situation. Severe flood is declared when water levels touch or exceed the danger level but are below the highest level.

Parts of Maharashtra and Konkan have been receiving very heavy rain since Tuesday with some places recording over 20 cm rain over two days.

Tillari Dam in Maharashtra‚Äôs Kolhapur district has filled up to 80% of its full capacity. Since heavy rain has been predicted in its catchment, water releases from the dam as per standard operating procedure should be made, the commission said.

There is also a possibility of urban flooding in Mumbai, according to Central Water Commission CWC) . Sudden rise in water levels was expected amid very heavy rains and high waves in the range of 3.5-3.7 metres until Friday along the Maharashtra coast from Malvan to Vasai and cause flooding, according to CWC.

Nine states have recorded excess rains‚Äî20 to 59% above normal--until Thursday. As many as two have received large excess‚Äîover 60% above normal.

On the other hand, Gurugram did not have a metropolitan development authority till 2017 and a municipal corporation till 2007. It had, although, begun finishing its first housing projects in the 1980s.

On Wednesday, when 70mm of rain poured down on Noida and 118mm on Gurugram, this difference manifested itself in water-logged roads, flooded homes and serpentine traffic jams that were seen in one city, but not the other.

‚ÄúNoida is a planned city while Gurugram was developed in isolation. In Gurugram, a developer buys 100 acres or 500 acres from a farmer, develops a township, lays infrastructure inside the township and empties rain water outside the campus. It was a piecemeal approach,‚Äù said SC Gaur, chief coordinator and planner with the UP national capital region cell, while explaining how town planning methodologies used for Noida and Gurugram were different.

‚ÄúIn Noida, the authority develops roads, drainage network and other civic infrastructure before allotting the land to a developer,‚Äù Gaur said.

Rajvir Singh, former chief town planner, Haryana, who is now a consultant, said urban planning failed on many counts in Gurugram. ‚ÄúInitially, when the development plan for the city was being prepared, it was pointed out that natural drains and dams should not be disturbed. However, real estate development was allowed in a haphazard manner. Also, despite a master plan for the city, most of the features remained on paper and thus the civic infrastructure in the city is still catching up with the urban growth,‚Äù said Singh.

Experts pointed out that flooding during monsoon is also because of the difference between the topography of the two cities.

‚ÄúNoida is surrounded by Yamuna and Hindon and is located on plains, where stormwater drains empties out in the two rivers. Also, the city has a planned drainage system. Gurugram, on the other hand, is a hilly terrain with a poor gradient. Moreover, with natural drains such as Najafgarh and Badshahpur being encroached upon in many places, stormwater floods on the city roads,‚Äù said Professor Dr Gauhar Mehmood of the department of civil engineering, Jamia Millia Islamia, Delhi. Mehmood worked with the Gurugram Municipal Corporation and helped set up water conservation structures to conserve rainwater in 2010-11.

Natural drains, which were spread across the Gurugram district and prominent dams, which existed since the British period at Ghata, Wazirabad, Nathupur, Jharsa and Manesar, have vanished due to encroachments. City officials said it is one of the main reasons for the flooding of Golf Course Road and adjacent areas. ‚ÄúThe current stormwater drainage system is inadequate to take the load. Exigency plans need to be created and special emphasis should be put on rainwater harvesting and creating small lakes, which can keep roads free of stormwater,‚Äù said Prof Sewa Ram from School of Planning and Architecture in Delhi.

VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), said deployment of motor pumps is only a relief measure and until the city‚Äôs drainage system is augmented, waterlogging will persist.

Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, Noida authority, said: ‚ÄúTeams from water department were on standby to address waterlogging complaints. We had also set up water pumping stations. At the Mamura underpass, water-logging did take place but we managed to pump out water from all low-lying areas soon after rain stopped. We were able to perform better also because Noida has well-planned roads, drainage network and the irrigation drain takes rainwater into the Yamuna and Hindon.‚Äù

Gurugram also has a plethora of civic agencies: HSVP, HSIIDC, GMDA and MCG. Noida has one.

While the Noida Master plan 2031 defines land use of each sector before it is allotted to builders for housing or for setting up industries, most of the new sectors in Gurugram (from sector 58 to 115) lack roads, water supply, power infrastructure and sewerage system.

KK Rao, Gurugram police commissioner, said waterlogging has been one of the biggest challenges for all government agencies, including the police. ‚ÄúPoor road engineering, improper drainage system and human negligence are the reasons which lead to such situations. The drains are not regularly and properly cleaned, the water pumps are not that effective and the terrain is also not friendly. Regular monitoring and joint efforts by all the agencies can only avert a repeat of Gurujam,‚Äù he said.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Key Highlights Gurugram floods exposed how the 'millennium city' is poorly planned Flooding and water logging has taken place in Mumbai, Chennai, Jaipur and several other cities On Wednesday, Gurugram received over 95 mm of rainfall

Gurugram: Come the monsoon and Indian cities turn into veritable nightmares, leading to agony for its citizens. Waterlogging, flooding and the consequent perils have become common with the onset of the rainy season. Incessant rain in Delhi and NCR region flooded many streets, with Gurugram bearing the maximum brunt of it. Heavy showers submerged low-lying areas in waist-deep water and brought the traffic to a halt.

On Wednesday, Gurugram received over 95 mm of rainfall. This is one-fifth of the total rain that the city receives annually. A three-hour rain spell left many localities submerged. Gurugram, a city which professes to be one of the shimmering examples of a millennium city, came to a standstill on Wednesday. Why is it that every year normal life is disrupted in the urban areas with the advent of the monsoon. Prof. Shreekant Gupta of the Delhi School of Economics believes what happened in Gurgaon is an example of an 'urban disaster'. ""Gurgaon in terms of its urban planning is a nightmare,"" he says.

Urbanization is an inescapable process and urban zones will keep on developing demographically and spatially. On the other hand, climate change is causing erratic rainfall patterns each year. ""We can't always blame the weather,"" says Vaishali Nigam Sinha, Gurugram resident and Chair of ReNew Foundation. ""Planning failed us at some point, the maintenance in these cities is failing us. I don't think enough is being done,"" she says.

Rainfall updates from across India:

DELHI-NCR

Delhi has received incessant rainfall over the past couple of days, which has managed to throw normal life out of gear in the national capital and adjoining areas. The heavy rains have led to long traffic snarls, trees lying on roads and also caused damage to property in many areas.

Noida in Gautam Buddh Nagar of Uttar Pradesh recorded its heaviest spell of rainfall this season (133 mm) over a 24-hour period from Wednesday till Thursday morning, while it was 51 mm for Greater Noida.

Gurgaon in Haryana received 140 mm of rainfall during the period, while the adjoining Faridabad got 91 mm rain, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) data stated.

BIHAR & UTTAR PRADESH

In Bihar, the flood continues to remain as grim. With two more deaths, the toll in Bihar floods has climbed to 27 with nearly 82 lakh people being affected across 16 districts of the state. Floods have affected 81,79,257 people in 1,317 panchayats of 130 blocks till Thursday.

In Uttar Pradesh, over 870 villages are submerged in water after incessant heavy rainfall over the past days that have raised water levels in the rivers. In a video shared by news agency ANI, villages in Pura Bazar of Ayodhya were seen flooded after the water level in Sarayu River rose to alarming levels.

Relief Commissioner Sanjay Goyal said that 578 of the affected villages are marooned and relief work was going on in the affected areas.

MAHARASHTRA

As Maharashtra prepared for the Ganesh Chaturthi festivities that are to begin on Saturday, Mumbai most parts of the state have been warned of heavy to very heavy rainfall starting Friday. While it has already started raining heavily in parts of Mumbai, IMD has issued an orange alert for Raigad while Palghar is also expected to receive heavy rains.

JAMMU & KASHMIR, HARYANA

Further north, in Haryana, heavy rainfall has triggered waterlogging in parts of the Palwal region. Most places in neighbouring Punjab witnessed light rains.

In Jammu and Kashmir, several landslides were reported that were triggered by heavy rains. Landslides blocked the 270-km Jammu-Srinagar national highway, the only all-weather road linking Kashmir to rest of the country. Over 200 vehicles were stranded at different points of the highway on Thursday.

In Kerala, the death toll in the Pettimudilandslide climbed to 63 on Thursday with the recovery of an unidentified woman's body while search is on for seven missing people.

Fresh spell of heavy rainfall in Andhra Pradesh has resulted in the swelling of Krishna and Godavari river tributaries. Several streams are flowing at danger level since Friday morning, which has paralysed normal life in the state as roads in Nandigama, Mylavaram, Kanchikacherla, Penuganchiporlu, Chandarlapadu Nuzvid, Challapalli and Gudivada have been inundated in knee-deep water.

With heavy rains lashing the state, water levels in Krishna River near Prakasam Barrage have been increasing steadily.

delhi,2020,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/pollution/sahibi-nadi-how-a-river-was-killed-74254,16-Nov-20,Sahibi Nadi: How a river was killed,"While the death of the Sahibi illustrates the general apathy towards rivers, the same is applicable to every river in India flowing in urban areas

In his book, The Biology of Belief, American biologist Bruce Lipton narrates a peculiar tree killing technique practised by the tribes of the Solomon Islands. The tribals encircle a tree and curse it relentlessly. Apparently, the tree eventually dies.

Here, Lipton seeks to highlight the power of the subconscious mind to convert positive or negative sentiments into self-fulfilling prophesies. You may take Lipton‚Äôs story with a pinch of salt. But, it appears to be working in case of our commons (water bodies, grazing lands, sacred groves, etc).

Nala, a Hindi word that once meant a channel for carrying storm water as well as rivulet or stream, has degenerated to signify only a dirty channel of water. Drain, that once signified a channel to drain something, especially rain water, has come to mean a channel carrying waste water.

While it may be difficult to pinpoint the exact moment these terms underwent degeneration, it seems to coincide with urbanisation, which came at a cost to our commons. Their value was lost on the community, with hassle-free availability of finite resources through utilities, predicating a disconnect with our natural heritage.

The Sahibi

A particularly poignant story playing out right before our indifferent eyes is that of the Sahibi nadi (river) aka Sahabi, Sahbi or Sabi. At one time, this river might have held perennial flow as is evident by the presence of several Indus Valley Civilization sites on its banks as well as those of its tributaries, the Sota, Krishnavati and Dohan.

Scholars have identified the Sahibi river with the Drishadvati river of the Vedic period. We have willfully overlooked the rich heritage the nadi represents. Presently, this ephemeral river rises phoenix-like from some of the most arid regions of India. It flows from the Saiwar hills in Sikar district in Rajasthan.

It goes forth, collecting the waters of almost 100 tributaries. In its upper reaches, the Sahibi drains parts of Rajasthan like Alwar and the southern districts of Haryana like Rewari. In its lower reaches, it receives the waters of the Indori nala near Pataudi and Badshah nala further north.

Beyond Pataudi to the north, the nadi extends in two directions: north-west and north. The latter course used to join the Yamuna via the Najafgarh jheel (lake) and drain number 6. The former used to link it with the Jhajjar depression and drain number 8, which also joins the Yamuna.

Downstream of the Najafgarh jheel on the Delhi side, the nadi used to drain into the Yamuna just before Wazirabad through a channel now famously known as the Najafgarh drain. The Najafgarh drain gets its name from the Najafgarh jheel.

According to noted historian and academician Sohail Hashmi, sometime during the Mughal period, a severe earthquake had hit this region, which led to the formation of the Najafgarh jheel and resulted in reduced flow on the Delhi side of the Sahibi nadi.

This is corroborated by a 1978 article in the Puratattava journal of the Indian Archaeological Society (IAS). The article suggests that the Sahibi is an older geological formation than the Najafgarh jheel.

This jheel got its name from Mirza Najaf Khan, the commander-in-chief of the Mughal Army under Emperor Shah Alam II. He built a strong fort on the banks of the Najafgarh jheel, that later came to be known as Najafgarh fort.

Nothing remains of the fort today, except for the Najafgarh village, which is fast getting urbanised. Najaf Khan‚Äôs tomb lies right next to the Safdarjung flyover, around a kilometre each from Safdarjung‚Äôs tomb and the Lodhi Gardens as well as the hyperactive INA market.

The Najafgarh drain on the Delhi side is a creation of a more recent time wherein the government of the North-West Province in 1865 excavated the irregular channel of Sahibi (An antique map of 1807 of the Environs of Delhi depicts the channel of Sahibi nadi as Sabee nullah ‚Äî a series of jheels connected through small streams draining into the Yamuna) from the eastern end of the jheel to the Yamuna. This was done to drain the jheel and create more cultivable land.

Masani Barrage

Owing to its long passage through arid and sandy country, the Sahibi flows with strength only during the rainy season. Heavy floods were recorded in 1845, 1873, 1917, 1930, 1933, 1960, 1963, 1972 and 1977.

To check the entry of Sahibi waters in Delhi, a regulator was constructed at Dhansa in 1964, along with a bund on the Delhi side of the jheel. Again, in response to the great flood in 1977 that affected far-off places like Janakpuri in Delhi, the Masani barrage was constructed on the Delhi-Jaipur highway near Masani village in Rewari.

Several smaller dams have also been constructed throughout the hills of Rajasthan to store rainwater. The construction of dams has restricted the flow of water in the nadi and it is now rare for water overflow from monsoon rains to reach up to the Masani barrage.

Downstream from the barrage, there is no flow in the Sahibi. The course of the Sahibi from the Masani barrage to Dhansa, where the river enters Delhi, upto Najafgarh jheel is either encroached upon or altered.

The construction of the barrage not only sealed the fate of the Sahibi but also that of Najafgarh jheel, along with the Najafgarh drain. One of the fundamental rights of a river is to flow. Another is to receive tribute from its tributaries while simultaneously paying tribute to a larger river.

Killing the Sahibi prematurely at Masani barrage and not allowing it to meet Yamuna, is a violation of its fundamental rights.

It is amazing that nature has a way to cling on despite humanity‚Äôs best efforts to undermine or destroy it. Several important wetlands lie in a series along the current and paleochannels of the Sahibi river.

These include the Masani barrage wetland, Matanhail forest, Chhuchhakwas-Godhari, Khaparwas Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhindawas Wildlife Sanctuary, Sarbashirpur, Sultanpur National Park, Basai Wetland, Najafgarh jheel and Najafgarh drain bird sanctuary, all of which are home to endangered and migratory birds.

They, however, largely remain unprotected and are under extreme threat from real estate developers. Here, nature personified by the Sahibi is trying desperately to maintain a fingerhold on a cliffhanger, while humankind ‚Äî the villain of this piece, is trying its level best to stamp out the fragile existence of the Sahibi with spiked boots.

While legislation is in place to protect rivers, the wheels turn ever so slowly. The River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities Order, 2016 is a document with an ambitious scope.

It ordains applicability to the states comprising the Ganga basin, including Haryana and the National capital Territory of Delhi. It brings the Ganga and all its tributaries (which includes the Yamuna as well as its tributaries such as the Sahibi nadi) and their respective flood plains under its ambit.

It explicitly prohibits construction of any sort in such flood plains. However, this order is being observed in its breaches particularly on the Haryana side of the Sahibi and its wetlands in Gurugram.

By the time strict enforcement of such orders happens, perhaps it may be too late for what is left of the Sahibi and its series of wetlands or it may call for demolition of structures, which are found to be in its violation. Such post-facto actions are bound to be vociferously contested by the affected parties in the courts of the land, with no easy or quick resolutions.

Meanwhile, the Najafgarh drain is the largest contributor of sewage (55-60 per cent) to the Yamuna in Delhi, which, in turn, has been declared, alarmingly, dead for all practical purposes. The pollutants from the Najafgarh jheel and the drain are leaching into the soil and contaminating the aquifers.

However, it wasn‚Äôt always like this. Sohail Hashmi talks about days that don‚Äôt go back very far. Upto the 1960s, the drain had clean water to sustain fish and people used to catch fish in it.

Hashmi particularly narrates an event of the early 1960s, when a vanaspati (vegetable oil) factory at Zakhira accidently discharged large amounts of vanaspati into the nearby Najafgarh drain.

Since it was winter at the time, the vanaspati solidified in the drain water. The water was so clean at that time that people in the surrounding areas collected the vanaspati from the drain for use in their homes.

Lessons for India

The Sahibi‚Äôs story is the story of all rivers in India. They have been reduced to the latter meaning of the terms nala and drain, especially in urban areas. This is true for not just water bodies but for all commons.

Traditionally, Indians were known to live sustainably with nature. This is evident from the country‚Äôs rich heritage in harvesting water or protecting endangered flora or fauna in sacred groves.

So, when did we stop caring for our water bodies and started discharging our domestic sewage into our rivers and streams turning them into sewers? The answer can be found in journalist and author Sopan Joshi‚Äôs book Jal Thal Mal.

He attributes the degeneration of our water bodies to the modern sewer systems. Unlike the west, where the sewer systems are separate from the storm water channels, in India, due to high costs, the sewer system have been merged with the existing storm water channels in virtually all the cities.

Joshi rues the grim state of our water bodies despite half of India‚Äôs population still not having access to toilets. He shudders to contemplate the plight of our water bodies when all Indians will have access to toilets connected to a sewer system.

Sopan Joshi further argues how we have continuously ignored the triangular link of our excreta with our water and land. Excreta, which correctly should have been converted into manure to enrich our soils, is being disposed off into our water bodies, thereby polluting them ‚Äî a clear case of double whammy.

A state like Delhi lies in a high seismic zone but is also prone to cold and hot waves along with floods and high levels of air pollution. The need for disaster management is also a part of the central government's Smart Cities Mission. Experts say that there is a need to have efficient policies in place to tackle situations which arise from both natural and man-made disasters.

‚ÄúThe state of Delhi is also heavily dependent on its neighbouring states. These states have a bigger role to play along with the role of the state of Delhi. Some of the environmental difficulties include air pollution, heavy rainfall, extreme heat and cold wave. If you are working in heat wave conditions then there is a loss of productivity of up to 40%. They need to become mainstream discussion agendas. They need to be integrated into plans and policies,"" Abinash Mohanty, Programme Lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said in this podcast.

He said that when there are other events happening parallel then it will de-stabilize the system.

‚ÄúDelhi has lost almost 38% of its wetlands which is why the flash floods cannot be restrained since wetlands act as absorbers. We have lost forest covers, wetlands, which causes increase in incidents like flooding, incessant rainfall and cloud bursts. Delhi is also prone to earthquakes.

Incessant rains in the last few days has triggered this year's third wave of floods in the state, claiming one life in Nagaon district on Saturday, said the Assam State Disaster Management (ASDMA).

The fresh fatality has pushed the number of deaths in flood-related incidents in Assam this year to 118, it added.

Delhi recorded a maximum temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, which is two notches above the normal, while the minimum temperature was 23.2 degrees Celsius.

The national capital's air quality improved marginally on Sunday due to high wind speed, while favourable ventilation conditions are likely to keep it in the ""moderate"" category for the next three days, a government forecasting agency said.

The city registered a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 117 on Sunday, an improvement from 165 on Saturday. An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.

Sporadic farm fires were observed on Saturday around Punjab and border regions but its impact has been negligible so far due to unfavourable wind direction and speed, the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) said.

However, it said that late withdrawal of monsoon and associated stagnant winds are likely to influence Delhi's air quality negatively by the weekend.

In neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, light rains and thundershowers occurred at isolated places, with the meteorological department predicting mostly dry weather in the state on September 28 and September 29.

The maximum and minimum temperatures in Punjab and Haryana hovered around 35 degrees Celsius and 21 degrees Celsius respectively, with parts of both the states witnessing overcast conditions.

In the northeastern state of Assam, the districts of Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Morigaon, Nagaon, Majuli, West Karbi Anglong, Sivasagar, Dibrugarh and Tinsukia have been affected, the ASDMA said in its report.

Nagaon is the worst-hit district with 1.51 lakh people affected, followed by Morigaon (32,711), Dhemaji (16,792) and Dibrugarh (10,622), it said, adding over 10,000 hectares of crops have been submerged.

The mighty Brahmaputra river is flowing above the danger mark at Neamatighat in Jorhat district and Tezpur in Sonitpur.

Road connectivity has been affected in Morigaon, Nagaon and West Karbi Anglong districts while 43 relief camps have been set up in three districts so far, the ASDMA said.

Meanwhile, the weather department said, ""Conditions are becoming favourable for withdrawal of monsoon from west Rajasthan and adjoining areas from September 28.""

Data suggests the country has received 9 per cent more rainfall than normal until September 26 and the rainy season is most likely to end on an above-normal note.

Mahesh Palawat, the vice president of private forecaster Skymet Weather, said, ""The withdrawal of monsoon from west Rajasthan is likely to start from tomorrow (Monday). It looks like monsoon will withdraw on an above-normal note.""

Rainfall in the range of 96 to 104 per cent of the Long Period Average (LPA) is considered as 'normal', while precipitation in the range of 104 to 110 per cent of the LPA is 'excess'.

Nine states have received excess rainfall, while 20 states have recorded normal precipitation, the data shows.

The official rainfall season in India is from June 1 to September 30. Monsoon arrived over Kerala on June 1, its normal onset date.

June recorded 17 per cent more rainfall, while July saw 10 per cent deficiency. However, there was an excess rainfall in August -- the month recorded 27 per cent more rainfall than normal.

Parts of north India -- Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir -- have recorded deficient rainfall. The Union Territory of Ladakh has recorded high deficiency of rainfall this year.

Large parts of the country in the west and south India, including Gujarat, Goa, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, have received excess rainfall. Sikkim is the only state to have received large excess rainfall.

Rain and thundershower were observed in at most places in Andhra Pradesh, coastal and north Karnataka in the south, and some northeastern states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura as well as sub-Himalayan West Bengal. Parts of Bihar, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu received rains.

Most of Telangana also received rains with Dandepalle in Mancherial district recording 11 cms of precipitation followed by six cms in Sarangapurnrl in Nirmal district and five cms in Sangareddy.

Heavy rains had lashed several parts of the state on Saturday resulting in massive flooding and waterlogging in low-lying areas.

As the uncertainty over the monsoon increases, and the groundwater levels fall to ‚Äòcritical‚Äô category (as classified by the Central Ground Water Board), Delhi government has proposed to create an underground reservoir that can store an estimated 37,000 million gallons of rainwater.

The CGWB‚Äôs critical category indicates that the groundwater resources are largely stressed in the region, and hence, immediate actions should be taken to manage the resource sustainably. The proposed project will be carried out along the Yamuna floodplain in the northwest of Delhi‚Äôs Palla on a 1000-acre land. If the underground reservoir successfully stores the proposed amount of water, it is said to be enough to meet the city's water supply shortfall even during peak summer.

Authorities and the government is confident that the project has the potential to meet the shortfall during the city‚Äôs peak summer. The Yamuna floodplains consist of alluvial soil with a high percolation rate of 6-9m per day and the Delhi government is planning to rent this land from the farmers who are cultivating crops across the area. According to a report in The Times Of India, a 100 crore budget has been allotted for groundwater conservation projects.

As there are no well-established storage facilities except a few natural aquifers, about 280 million cubic metres of water is lost every year during the monsoon in Delhi. Therefore, the new project aims to create small ponds that will be built across the 20 km stretch from Palla to Wazirabad.

Announcing the pilot project, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal assured that these ponds would be completely eco-friendly and the water will be able to reach these ponds only when there is flooding in the river Yamuna. There has been an average of 18 flooding cycles in river Yamuna each year yielding about 3,700 million gallons of water.

Advertisement Forecasts suggest that the southwest monsoon is likely to arrive in Delhi within the next two days after a long delay. Generally cloudy skies with very light rains or thunderstorms are forecast across Delhi till Friday. The increasing uncertainty over the timing and intensity of the monsoon has posed a significant threat to water security in many large cities across the country. Chennai, Delhi, and Bengaluru have been facing the risk of ‚ÄòDay Zero‚Äô as early as 2010. Day zero is when cities run out of the water and the supply is shut off.

Speaking to the Times of India, Ankit Shrivastava, technical advisor of Delhi Jal Board suggests that there is potential in retrieving water from Yamuna‚Äôs flooding and storing it in the floodplain. The demand-supply gap in Delhi ranges from 250 to 300 million gallons of water per day, according to Shrivastava, if they manage to preserve good amount of water the extraction of only 100 million cubic metres will be enough to meet one month‚Äôs water demand.

The state cabinet meeting led by Arvind Kejriwal that approved the project also made rainwater harvesting mandatory in all the government buildings.

The Farakka Barrage has been a controversial project since inception. The first landmark publication against the Nehruvian penchant for large dams was authored in 1961 by the then superintending engineer of the West Bengal government, Kapil Bhattacharya. He warned that the construction of the barrage would lead to heavy flooding and siltation in Malda and Murshidabad districts of West Bengal, and to floods in Bihar. Bhattacharya was hounded for criticising the project, which was originally conceived by the British in 1853 to ‚Äúflush out silt from the approach channel‚Äù to their key trading port, Calcutta. After Independence, the Centre and the Bengal governments pursued the project, disregarding criticisms.

At that time, there were three key arguments against the building of the barrage. First, the designed discharge of 27 lakh cusec was way below what‚Äôs needed during floods; second, it will increase siltation in Ganga owing to reduced flow during the lean months; and, third, that the barrage would reduce water flow into Padma (East Pakistan).

All three apprehensions have been proved right in the later years.

Either due to deft diplomacy by the Bangladesh government or the weakness of the HD Deve Gowda-led government, in the 1996 (lean season) water-sharing treaty between India and Bangladesh, Dhaka was able to wrest the desired discharge from Delhi. Bihar, a key stakeholder, was neither included as a participant in the negotiations, nor was its protest on the treaty‚Äôs provisions ever considered. Moreover, both the Indian and Bengal governments could never work out any alternative for the much-hyped 40,000 cusecs of discharge throughout the year into the Hoogly channel, which was, allegedly, required to keep the Kolkata port operational.

So, who has been bearing the brunt of these commissions and omissions? Bihar. While the state suffers from annual flooding, a series of dams and barrages over the Ganga, and its tributaries in Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, are denying Bihar its due share of the river‚Äôs water.

To honour the Indo-Bangladesh treaty‚Äôs commitment of ensuring 1,500 cusec of discharge at Farakka, Bihar has to provide this from the state‚Äôs other rivers. This means Bihar only gets 400 cusecs of water from the Ganga during the lean months (January to May). This low water volume and the resultant placid flow year after year have dried up the river‚Äôs channels, leaving enormous silt deposits in its lower reaches. The gradually ascending river beds abet inundation during the high volume flooding periods because the choked discharge at Farakka restricts free flow. It is a double whammy for Bihar.

It defies logic how the Central Water Commission (CWC) has persisted with its stand on the issue despite several submissions by the Bihar government and expert group estimations pointing to the need for a rethink on Ganga water sharing and decommissioning of the Farakka barrage.

Repeated submissions by the Bihar government for a review of international and inter-state water-sharing arrangement, and optimising the Farakka barrage‚Äôs discharge capacity to meet the changed hydrology of the river, have been systematically downplayed by CWC. The momentum generated by two high-level expert meetings in Patna and Delhi in 2017 has not produced anything productive. Reviving the discourse has become imperative once again.

The annual agony of flooding is a demonic drain on the national resources and not just that of Bihar. Given its political and diplomatic clout, the National Democratic Alliance is best poised to redeem Bihar and its 130 million people from this scourge.

Key Highlights The Yamuna river was recorded to be flowing at 206.08 metres at 1 pm today There is a rise in Yamuna water level because of rains in northern India and discharge of water from Hathnikund barrage by neighbouring Haryana The Delhi authorities have shut the purana pul for vehicular and rail traffic movement

New Delhi: In the wake of flood alert in Delhi, nearly 14,000 people living in low-lying areas along the Yamuna river were evacuated till Tuesday noon. The Yamuna river was recorded to be flowing at 206.08 metres at 1 pm on Tuesday, after crossing the danger mark of 205.33 metres on Monday night.

There is a rise in water level because of rains in northern India and discharge of water from Hathnikund barrage by neighbouring Haryana.

The Delhi authorities have shut the purana pul (Old Iron Yamuna Bridge) for vehicular and rail traffic movement.

The national capital witnessed the worst floods in 1978 when the water in the Yamuna river touched a record 207.49m, resulting in the displacement of lakhs of residents. Areas like Model Town, Jahangirpuri, Gopal Nagar, Indiranagar, Majlis Park, Mukherjee Nagar, Alipur, Delhi University, Kingsway Camp, Civil Lines, Adarsh Nagar, Okhla, Sarai Kale Khan, Maharani Bagh, Janakpuri, Pankha Road, Hasthsal, Uttam Nagar, and Vishnu Garden were submerged.

Since then, the water level of Yamuna has crossed the 207-metre mark just two times ‚Äî 207.11m recorded in 2010 and 207.32m in 2013.

The Delhi Government has set up relief camps at Haathi Ghat and Kanchan Colony for those who were evacuated. Delhi Revenue Minister Kailash Gahlot inspected the camps today and tweeted: ‚ÄúInspected Relief Camps at Haathi Ghat and Kanchan Colony set up by Delhi Govt. Interacted with people who have been evacuated and now staying in relief camps. Have directed area DMs to ensure availability of all the relief materials.‚Äù

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had on Monday appealed to people living in the floodplains to shift to the tents set up by the Delhi government.

In order to help people, 46 relief camps with 2,120 tents have been set up by the Delhi government.

As per a Flood Control Department official, ‚Äúwater is being released from the barrage (which provides drinking water to Delhi) every hour.‚Äù

The official added that Haryana released 8.28 lakh cusecs of water on Sunday evening.

Usually, the water discharged from the barrage reaches the capital in 72 hours.

The state has received normal rain this monsoon season so far, however the extreme rainfall event around August 17 in the state and adjoining Himachal Pradesh where catchment areas of Satluj river is located caused heavy inflow into the Bhakra Nangal Dam, leading to discharge. The river recorded its highest ever flow in last three decades, carrying nearly 75,000 cusecs more water beyond its capacity of around 2 lakh cusecs.

As many as 14 districts were put on flood alert, as villages were evacuated and crops were damaged. ‚ÄúIt was an extreme rainfall event, and these events are on the rise over the last few decades,"" said Kuldeep Srivastava, Head of Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC), IMD, New Delhi.

Bhakra Dam, which normally gets filled to its permissible storage level of 1680 feet by September, was overflowing in August, for the first ever time ever.

Post the floods, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh that the government would canalize all rivers of the state with technical support from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. He said the move to realign river streams and courses, besides strengthening and widening of the river embankments would serve as a ‚Äòpermanent solution to the problem of floods‚Äô- a claim widely criticized by experts.

‚ÄúWhen embankments along river Yamuna could not prevent floods in Delhi, how will it save Punjab? River needs space to flow. If we interfere with its flow, we will face repercussions,"" said noted ecologist Dr Brij Gopal, former Professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

There are concerns that permanent embankments would lead to more human settlements along the flood plains, causing more damage once the breach takes place, which are ‚Äútoo common"".

Citing example of Kosi River in Bihar, retired Indian Forest Service officer, Manoj Mishra who leads the Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan said, ‚ÄúEmbankments create an illusion that people living alongside them are now safe from floods. More people settle in the floodplains. But look, what has happened in Bihar? The floods have been devastating. Why don‚Äôt we learn from our mistakes?""

Experts highlight that instead of focusing on creating embankments, the government must direct its attention to protecting the catchments area of major rivers. ‚ÄúIf we had protected our catchment areas well enough, all this damage could have been controlled,"" said Devinder Sharma, agriculture policy expert based in Punjab, ‚ÄúIt is more important, amid concerns of these rivers going dry due to climate change.""

It is not the first time, that any state government has proposed constructing canals as a solution to control floods. Uttar Pradesh too, undertook a major project in 2015 to straighten and shorten the Gomti river channel and control the width of its riverbed.

Professor Venkatesh Dutta from Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow who studied this riverfront development said this not only led to decline in freshwater species and deposition of silt in flood plains but lowered the groundwater tables in the city reach.

‚ÄúLet the river takes its own course. The best we could do is to restore the natural drainage patterns, the wetlands and small rivers which have gone dry. Put a long-term flood management plan by creating a drainage master plan for every river basin,"" he said.

Dr Veena Srinivasan from the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bengaluru, says the concept of concretizing rivers arose from the West, where authorities built embankments to protect the low-lying areas (below sea-level) from flooding.

‚ÄúBut, none of the cities where the embankments were successful witnessed the kind of extreme rainfall events that we have. In almost all such cases, the rainfall has been largely uniform throughout the year, but in India, rainfall is concentrated during the four months of monsoon,"" said Dr Srinivasan.

With extreme rainfall events on the rise, the disaster potential for flooding in major rivers has only increased. The pace of development has changed the land-use patterns, especially along the rivers, with increasing number of people living in low-lying areas. Experts highlight that overreliance on concrete based solutions is a cause of concern, especially when it is preceded by lack of any serious evaluation of whether this solution is effective or not.

‚ÄúFlood is a natural phenomenon, but we have converted it into a disaster. The need is to go to the root cause of the problem. It is a misplaced assumption that dams and constructing canals can prevent floods. Flood plains are meant for passage of water. One cannot alter the natural flow of rivers,"" said Mishra, ""let the rivers flow.""

Given the river's mood, the possibility of the water reaching there wasn't completely out of question. A newspaper alarmingly predicted that the Rashtrapati Bhawan too would be flooded. But it, and the sanctum sanctorum of Indian democracy, remained safe. What didn't was, Jehangirpuri, a slum located far-off in North Delhi, where houses were submerged and only rooftops pimpled the landscape.

Its residents, nearly 1.5 lakh in number, flocked out as water level rose alarmingly. Some stubbornly stayed back to salvage their belongings, only to find themselves marooned on their crumbling rooftops because Yamuna's whooshing water was unsparing. As panic-stricken people started taking shelter elsewhere, loot became common in the locality, which was set up on the floodplains of Yamuna during the Emergency.

For days to come, filth and stench blanketed Jehangirpuri. Its people were living their scariest nightmares with their lives turned topsy-turvy. Floods weren't alien to them but this scale was.

The year was 1978 and the month September. It was the time of the year when monsoon is generally at its fag end. Agricultural fields, especially in the Indo-Gangetic plains, are lush with paddy, drenched sufficiently in monsoon showers; people by now have had enough respite from the scorching sun; headlines on vector-borne diseases dot newspapers; and in Delhi, the temperature hovers around 30 degrees Celsius while the air is irritatingly humid, but bearable.

In India, floods in September are rare; massive ones, even rarer. On the contrary, this is a month when floodwaters start receding everywhere. But in September 1978, the floods broke previous records and set many that remain to be broken.

""Bearing all barriers and records of nearly a century, the rivers of North India conspired with the monsoon to erode signs of civilisation. Sweeping through the state of Haryana, sections of the capital city of Delhi, and through the landscape of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, the fury of flood spelt death, destruction and disease,"" was how the September 1978 cover story of India Today magazine started its reportage on the calamity.

Overall, the 1978 floods affected an area of 17.5 million hectares across the country - highest in the last 65 years. The floods also claimed 3,396 human lives and 23,9174 cattle, besides damaging 35,07,542 houses and affecting 70.450 million people.

1978: NOT AN OUTLIER

While 1978 bore witness to a catastrophe, it wasn't the lone year to do so. A year earlier, India had suffered 11,316 deaths - the highest between 1953 and 2017 - and a year later, the country witnessed the highest deaths of cattle i.e. 6,18,248.

Travelling through the corridor of time over the past decades, one finds that its walls were regularly imprinted with calamities like the one India weathered in 1978. Some were of similar magnitude, others far more catastrophic.

You need not travel far in your mind's eye to recall the harrowing images of storeys of concrete buildings being washed away like decks of cards in the violent waters of Mandakini and Alaknanda (tributaries of the Ganga) in Uttarakhand in 2013.

The month was June and the Char Dham Yatra (an annual pilgrimage to the Hindu shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri) was at its peak in the mountains.

It was a year when death and destruction literally poured in from the skies in 'Devbhoomi' (the adobe of Gods) as Uttarakhand is commonly known.

A double whammy of incessant rain and melting of a massive glacial lake just above the temple town of Kedarnath made Himalayan streams swell into seas of fast-flowing water. Their wailing torrents swept, buried and destroyed anything and everything that came in their way.

Left behind were lives prickled with needles of uncertainties and a plundered terrain where life once marinated in the hotchpotch of everyday mundaneness.

If 2013 is too far to travel back, one may also recollect the visuals of widespread devastation in Kerala during the monsoon downpour of 2018, a year when the state suffered its worst disaster in 100 years.

This year too, floods have wreaked havoc in Assam, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Bihar, among others states. More than 200 people have died in rain-related tragedies across the country and damages to property runs into thousands of crores.

TIMES CHANGE BUT SOME THINGS DON'T

India's political spectrum has undergone rapid transition over the last 65 years. Governments changed, leaders rose and fell, parties were formed and exterminated, issues and priorities too saw a sea of change, but what remains an eyesore is that despite their annual nature, floods continue to maim states, claim hundreds of lives and ravage valuable resources.

Whether it is Assam and Arunachal Pradesh in the Northeast, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh in the Gangetic plains, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and J&K in the hills, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in Central India or the southern states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the story is the same.

Geographically, India is located in a zone that is climatically very sensitive and bears a heavy population burden. It is one of the countries where the impact of global warming and climate change can be seen and measured tangibly. The rapidly melting Himalayan glaciers and the receding shorelines of islands in the Sundarbans are ready-to-refer examples.

Overall, it is estimated that 40 million hectares of land (roughly 12 per cent of India's geographical area) is prone to floods. While floods occur in India every year, data for the last 65 years show that the scale of their impact, in terms of area affected and damage caused, has been erratic.

SCALE OF DESTRUCTION

When data on damages suffered in floods in the past 65 years stare at you, there appears to be little difference in how India's richest and poorest, developed and 'Bimaru' states prepare for and work after floods. Everywhere it is a story of death and misery that repeats year after year.

Between 1953 and 2017, India suffered damages worth Rs 37,82,47,04,70,000 (Rs 3,78,247.047 crore) due to floods and heavy rains. Besides this, 1,07,535 people were killed, a total of 8,07,17,993 houses destroyed and an area of 466.335 million hectare affected.

For farmers, the overall damage to crops was Rs 1,11,225.621 crore (nearly 30 per cent of the total damages) and 60,49,349 cattle dead.

In terms of damages suffered in floods and heavy rain, the year 2015 was the most catastrophic for India. Data from the Central Water Commission show that the country's total loss due to floods in 2015 was Rs 57,291.1 crore. Of this, 45 per cent (Rs 25,912.51 crore) was in Tamil Nadu alone.

The winter of 2015 was one that people of Chennai will remember for many years, but for the wrong reasons. It was a year when within a few days Chennai was flooded at a scale never seen in the past 100 years.

The city came to a standstill as its residents were stranded in their homes. That winter, rainfall in Chennai was nearly three times the normal level. Some estimated that it was the world's eighth most expensive disaster in 2015.

CHANGING NATURE OF DAMAGE

If we look at the year-wise damages suffered in the past 65 years, we find that the scale of destruction has increased exponentially in the last two decades (see chart below).

The chart shows that since early 2000s, the overall damages suffered due to floods and heavy rains have increased rapidly - years like 2015, 2017, 2013, 2009, 2006 and 2010 all saw damages exceeding Rs 19,000 crore.

These damages include damage to crops, houses and public properties. Analysing the data, we find that in the past 65 years, the contribution of losses due to damages to crop, houses and public property have changed significantly.

Between 1953 and 1982, the loss suffered due to damaged crop was the biggest contributor to India's flood-related losses. For example, in 1953, damage to crop was estimated at Rs 42.08 crore while the damage to public property was just Rs 2.9 crore. The damage to public property was even lower than the damage to houses (Rs 7.42 crore).

But this changed from the 1980s onwards, when the share of loss due to damaged crop was overtaken by the loss due to damages of public property (see chart). Between 1983 and 1992, India's loss due to damaged crop in floods was Rs 11,773.37 crore, but the loss due to damaged public property was Rs 12,546.16 crore.

Over the years, this difference widened and between 2013 and 2017, the loss India suffered due to public property damaged in floods was 112 per cent more than that suffered due to damaged crop.

One of the likely factors responsible for this shift over the years is the increasing urbanisation in India and migration of people from rural areas to urban centres in search of job and better opportunities.

Besides this, as the Indian economy strengthened over the years (resulting in increase in people's incomes and living standards), the size of Indian cities also increased manifolds. But while cities became larger, the flood management and drainage systems failed to catch up with the need of the hour.

The best examples for this mismatch is the plight of India's four metropolitan cities - New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata - during monsoon every year. Despite being India's four most important cities, every year newspapers are splashed with images of these cities heavily flooded during monsoon rains. Deaths, destruction and agony have become the sad reality for these urban giants, despite their corridors of power and lanes of skyscrapers.

DOES WIDESPREAD FLOOD MEAN WIDESPREAD DAMAGE?

Another aspect of floods-related damages in India is that the total area affected by floods and the total damages suffered may not necessarily tell the same story. Flood data for the past 65 years dispels the perception that years that saw widespread floods (in terms of area affected) were also the years when damages were the most.

In 2006, the area affected by floods in India was 1.09 million hectare. This was the lowest in the 65 years between 1953 and 2017. But the total damages suffered in 2006 were to the tune of Rs 19,790.922 -- one of the highest amounts during these years. On the other hand, in 1978, an area of 17.5 million hectare was affected by floods - the highest. But the damages suffered were Rs 1,454.76 crore, a relatively smaller figure.

Similarly, flood-related damages in 2015 were estimated at Rs 57,291.09 crore - the highest in 65 years - but the number of people killed (1,420) was far less than 1977 when 11,316 people died in floods and heavy rains.

Thus, what this indicates is:

1) The damage caused by floods in a given year need not necessarily be dependent on how widespread the floods are.

2) Years which claim more lives need not necessarily be the years that suffer maximum damages.

3) Since the 1980s, the share of loss due to damaged crop in floods has significantly decreased in comparison to the share of loss due to damaged public property.

THE TIMES AHEAD

Given the fact that India is among the countries most affected by global warming and climate change, scientists have predicted that floods and drought will become more frequent in India. The data for the last 65 years support this assertion and show that the area affected by floods in India does not follow any pattern.

One year you may see widespread floods, while the next year the situation may be the complete opposite.

Example: In 1978, an area of 17.5 million hectare was affected by floods. A year later, the affected area was only 3.99 million hectare. In 1988, an area of 16.29 million hectare was affected, but a year later it was 8.06 million hectare and in 1992, it was just 2.65 million hectare. Closer to today, 2014 saw an area of 12.78 million hectare being affected by flood but a year earlier, the figure was just 2.14 million hectare. (More details in chart.)

Besides the monsoon rains and occasional cyclone-induced rains, the melting of Himalayan glaciers is a major source of flood in India. With the rapid increase of global temperatures coupled with incidents of forest fires in the Himalayan slopes becoming more regular and intense, glaciers have started melting at an alarming rate. This increases the total volume of water in the rivers, which becomes catastrophic, especially when monsoon-laden clouds reach the Northern plains and hit the Himalayas.

The most recent and devastating example of the two flood-inducing factors merging in this manner is the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy in Uttarakhand. Incessant monsoon rains aside, the disaster was aggravated by the sudden melting of the massive Chorabari Glacier, just above Kedarnath.

According to the World Bank, ""India is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change. It has one of the highest densities of economic activity in the world, and very large numbers of poor people who rely on the natural resource base for their livelihoods, with a high dependence on rainfall.""

In a recent paper published in Current Science, scientists from India Meteorological Department, National Geophysical Research Institute and National Disaster Management Agency, among others, reiterated that global warming is resulting in increased extreme rainfall in India.

""In recent decades, warming trend over the Indian Ocean has potentially enhanced moisture supply leading to rainfall extremes in the country,"" the paper said. The researchers said abrupt variability and increased uncertainty in rainfall patterns pose ""ever-increasing risk"" of flood disaster in India.

While these figures and studies give us a sense of the tragedies that people in India weather every year, they do not convey the emotional trauma and mental agony people suffered, suffer and will continue to suffer unless things change.

For instance, in August this year, researchers at Madras University in a study found that schoolchildren who witnessed the 2015 Chennai floods showed symptoms of anxiety and were found to be ""mentally traumatised"". The researchers also found that children from areas that were severely flooded showed increased symptoms of trauma.

As India stares and embarks into a future of climatic uncertainty, what remains certain is that death and destruction due to floods will continue to maim the country unless it finds a far-sighted flood management mechanism.

Data such as the one presented above may shock you, but the shock of seeing a loved one swept away in flood water, get buried in a landslide, or die suffering from disease that follow floods is far more shocking and painful. It can be only be felt. Numbers are numbers, they scream but don't feel.

RECAP OF WHAT FLOODS HAVE COST INDIA

The total flood-related damage in the past 65 years is estimated to be Rs 37,82,47,04,70,000.

At least 1,07,535 people and 60,49,349 cattle were killed.

A total of 8,07,17,993 houses were destroyed and an area of 466.335 million hectare affected.

delhi,2019,https://www.newsclick.in/Flood-hit-Tribals-Narmada-Valley-Gather-Delhi-Demand-Rehabilitation,21-Aug-19,Flood-hit Tribals from Narmada Valley Gather at Delhi to Demand Rehabilitation,"Hundreds of tribal residents from Madhya Pradesh came together in Delhi today under the banner of the Narmada Bachao Andolan to demand rehabilitation from the excessive flooding that is being caused by the increase in the water levels of the Sardar Sarovar Dam.

The Madhya Pradesh government had in early August, opened the floodgates of the Sardar Sarovar Dam to maintain the water level in the dam and water began approaching the villages in the state. The increase in the water levels has severely affected over 192 villages in Madhya Pradesh, 33 villages in Maharashtra and 19 villages in Gujarat. Speaking at the protest organised in Delhi, Rohit, a member of Narmada Bachao Andolan, who travelled from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi, said, ‚ÄúThe situation is extremely critical, two people have died in flooding instances. Villages are getting flooded and electricity is being cut. Moreover, the authorities are hell bent on increasing the water levels of the Sardar Sarovar Dam.‚Äù

The current protests were sparked off after five people of Rajghat village in MP were electrocuted. Two of the five died on spot. Chiman Darbar, 40, and Santosh Mankar, 35, both residents of Rajghat village, were trying to reach their families with food supplies and other essentials from Barwani village when their boat rammed into a power cable due to influx of water. Their village has turned into an island inundated by the backwaters of Sardar Sarovar.

As the situation worsens in the state, the MP government has washed its hands off any accountability to bring the situation under control. The government is claiming to have provided rehabilitation to the locals while the activists from the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) state that the lives of over 32,000 families are still at risk. Vimal Bhai of the National Alliance of People‚Äôs Movements (NAPM) said, ‚ÄúIf all was well why would the tribals be ready to take a jal samadhi (submerge in water). Two people have died already as this is a situation of grave crisis. A delegation also attempted to negotiate with the authorities. Meanwhile, the government is claiming that all compensation has been paid and families have been rehabilitated.‚Äù

One of the protesting activists said, ‚ÄúWe are demanding that the government should check how many people are suffering due to the lack of rehabilitation. According to us, the number runs more than 32,000 families. We want an independent enquiry into the number of families at risk.‚Äù

The activists have now been told that the Chief Secretary of Madhya Pradesh will take stock of the situation. The tribals have also criticised the government for giving a leeway to corporate giants such as Coca Cola and Tata Nano in terms of water usage while farmers suffer. A villager from Madhya Pradesh said, ‚ÄúWe want our land to be returned to us. The dam was built for our benefit, but we are not able to access even drinking water for ourselves as our houses are now flooded.‚Äù

As the crisis worsens, the activists on the ground have alleged that the Kamal Nath led Congress government in the state is attempting to suppress the ongoing movement. Cases have been registered against fifteen protesting persons for blocking the National Highway-3 in Dhar district in protest demanding proper rehabilitation. Additionally, over 400 cases have been filed against unknown persons for the same. The protesters had blocked the highway for over six hours on August 13. They had also written an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him to take immediate action on the situation.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

‚ÄòGeneration Gap‚Äô

In Shikarpur, one of the villages near the lake, octogenarian Ramphal Tyagi and his 42-yearold son Rajeev Kumar are divided in their opinion over the utility of the project. Tyagi recounts that the lake would flood their fields and homes during monsoon but his son want the lake revived in the larger good and is in fact ready to part with some of his land, if the need arises.

‚ÄúThis is generation gap. There is a lot of difference between then and now. Then there was a route for water to enter the village and to drain as well. Now, water is scarce. It would be good if the lake is restored,‚Äù said Rajeev, a DTC bus driver.

Experts cited a Central Ground Water Board report in favour of the lake‚Äôs revival. As per the report, water table in southwest Delhi is under the ‚Äòsemi-critical‚Äô category.

‚ÄúThe presence of a large water body in the area would bring down the temperature by a few degrees. Once the water body is revived the soil in that area would be able to hold more moisture, which would, in turn, help the growth of trees. It would also help to prevent runoff during heavy rains and prevent flooding,‚Äù said environmentalist CR Babu, while citing the example of Yamuna Biodiversity Park, which has a large water body stretching more than 1.8 km in length.

Tyagi, however, is not convinced. He says the lake has been there since 1807 and it would cause floods every year. ‚ÄúWe had to escape and take shelter at a temple for days at a stretch,‚Äù he said.

After the lake dried up in 1960s, locals started farming on the lake bed.

NGT Directions

In March this year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed the governments of Delhi and Haryana to report on the action taken to declare the Najafgarh lake as a water body and restore it.

The direction came in response to a PIL filed by the NGO, Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) in 2014 to seek the revival of the lake which had at one point in time occupied close to 220-250 square kilometres.

‚ÄúEven though the Delhi Gazetteer (1884) records that the jheel sprawled over 220 sq km, at present, it has been shrunk to just around two sq km. But once it is restored it would measure around seven sq km. Even if we go by conservative estimates, the revived lake would be able to recharge the groundwater table by at least 14 million litres per day,‚Äù said Manu Bhatnagar, INTACH‚Äôs principal director, Natural Heritage division.

After the lake flooded Tilak Nagar and Janakpuri in west Delhi in 1977, Delhi constructed a supplementary drain to carry the flood discharge into the Yamuna. Since then, the villages on the Delhi side of the lake have seen a gradual depletion of water level, eventually exposing the land upon which they now carry out agriculture. The villages on the Haryana side still gets flooded and the farmers complain of poor agricultural produce.

Restoration Requirements

Restoring the water body would require the governments of Delhi and Haryana to acquire agricultural lands of 7-10 villages.

At present untreated and undertreated wastewater including industrial effluents make their way into the jheel and drain.

This polluted water is contaminating the groundwater too making it non-potable.

‚ÄúThis lake has been here since the time I was born. But now it has gotten worse because all the drains of the nearby villages empty into it. Even if there is no rainwater, the dirty water from the drains are flowing into this land,‚Äù said Bheem Singh, a resident of Daulatabad village in Haryana.

On Delhi side, villages of Rawta, Ghumanhera, Jainpur, Shikarpur and Jhatikra are situated around the lake.

‚ÄòPotent Ecosystem‚Äô

Experts, however, say that the revival of the lake would provide a potent ecosystem to Delhi and Gurugram, helping the twin cities to recharge groundwater, acting as a buffer against extreme weather, a carbon sink and a habitat hosting birds like flamingos and pelicans.

‚ÄúIt is one of the best places in Delhi to locate water birds. But the authorities should proceed with caution so that it does not become a garden with a lake. If it loses its wilderness, the birds would be gone,‚Äù said ornithologist Nikhil Devasar.

The revival of existing lakes and water bodies for recharging groundwater has been on the agenda of the Delhi government. It has planned to revive around 300 water bodies and construct at least five artificial lakes.

‚ÄúThe revival of the Najafgargh lake would benefit the locals and south-west Delhi as a whole,‚Äù said Diwan Singh, an environment activist living in Dwarka, adding, ‚ÄúNot only would the water table be recharged but it would also save a big habitat for birds.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe governments have to come up with a good compensation package before they start acquiring land from the farmers,‚Äù he said.",solution,Najafgarh Lake Flood,"Najafgarh, Delhi, India",1977,Present,"Najafgarh, Delhi, India",,,,The lake flooded Tilak Nagar and Janakpuri in west Delhi in 1977.,"The lake has been there since 1807 and it would cause floods every year.

The global report released on Friday by Christian Aid, a UK-based charity organisation, said the extreme weather events, like cyclone Fani, led to damages of about $10 billion and uprooted 10 million trees in the country.

""Cyclone Fani was the strongest storm to make landfall in India in over 20 years, hitting India and Bangladesh from May 2 to 4, 2019 with wind speeds up to 200 km/h and led to storm surges of 1.5 metre.

""May and June saw $28 billion of damage in Asia. Cyclone Fani struck India and Bangladesh, parts of China experienced their highest rainfall for 60 years and in Northern India, a stronger than usual monsoon led to floods that killed 1,900 people,"" the report said.

It said the floods reflect trends that are being driven by climate change which makes extreme rainfall more common.

""One reason for this is that an atmosphere that is warmer can hold more water vapour. The world has so far heated about 1¬∞C since preindustrial times and, around the world, heavy rainfall has increased,"" the report said.

It said that in North India, rainstorms have become 50% more common and 80% longer.

""The trend of more unpredictable and extreme rainfall in India reflects what climate scientists predict will happen due to climate change, particularly if emissions do not fall. Another study found that monsoon rainfall will become more unpredictable, with variability increasing up to 50 per cent this century if emissions continue to rise,"" it said.

The report also said that besides displacing 3.4 million people, Cyclone Fani, which hit India and Bangladesh, uprooted more than 10 million trees in India.

""The storm brought heavy rainfall and flooding, causing widespread damage that killed at least 89 people, mostly in Odisha.

""More than 3.4 million people were displaced, more than 10 million trees were uprooted and, in Odisha alone, 140,000 hectares of crop land were damaged,"" it said.

Michael Mann, a climate scientist, said the cyclone was just a reminder of the threat that millions of people face due to climate change.

""Fani is just the latest reminder of the heightened threat that millions of people around the world face from the combination of rising seas and more intense hurricanes and typhoons. That threat will only rise if we continue to warm the planet by burning fossil fuels and emitting carbon into the atmosphere,"" Mann said.

Cyclone Fani reflected the consequences of climate change in several ways, the report said, adding that warmer ocean waters increased the energy available to it, allowing it to build strength, and warmer air temperatures allowed it to hold and then drop more water while sea-level rise increased the storm surge.",issue,2019 North India floods,India,"May 2, 2019","May 4, 2019",North India,100-200 mm,$10 billion,"1,900","More than three million people were displaced, more than 10 million trees were uprooted and, in Odisha alone, 140,000 hectares of crop land were damaged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

VIDEOS TAKE SOCIAL MEDIA BY STORM

Many netizens in the NCR area took to social media to post pictures and videos of the dust storm in the region. Many attributed the weather changes to Cyclone Vayu.

CYCLONE VAYU IMPACT REACHES DELHI

According to the weather department, the very severe cyclonic storm Cyclone Vayu is expected to have some impact on the weather in the capital.

According to Kuldeep Shrivastava, regional head, MET, ""This respite is mainly because of the effect of an active western disturbance which is affecting the upper Himalayan region and South Westerly winds which are coming from the Arabian Sea and hitting Delhi NCR in association with Cyclone Vayu hitting the west coast of our country. These winds being moisture laden have resulted in a dip in the mercury. We're expecting a relief from the heat wave condition as the temperature will remain below 45 degrees celcius mark. However, a slight rise in temperature is expected on 14th and 15th. After 15th, the temperatures will start dipping because of the cloud cover.""

The downpour in the past three days has increased water level of all the rivers flowing through these districts. The pictures and videos of the cattle drowning in the flood have been doing rounds on social media.

Amid this crisis, the state government has failed in providing adequate relief in the affected areas. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis is touring the state for his political yatra ahead of the Assembly polls in the state. This has angered the people further.

Meanwhile, the flood in Kolhapur and Sangli has also increased tensions between Maharashtra and its Southern neighbour Karnataka. Both the districts are on the border of Karnataka and release of water from the Alamatti dam has become a reason for conflict. Krishna, Koyna and Panchaganga are major rivers from these districts, and all three have crossed the danger level. This has created havoc in both the districts.

The Gaganbavada teshil of Kolhapur district has recorded the highest amount of rain ‚Äì 328 mm. For Bhudargad, it was 219 mm and for Radhanagari, 208 mm. This area also comes under the range of the Alamatti dam. The Maharashtra government is pressurising the Karnataka government to increase the flow of Alamatti. According to guardian minister Chandrakant Patil, Maharashtra CM has spoken to Karnataka CM BS Yediyurappa in this regard.

A village called Prayag Chikhali in Kolhapur district has been almost completely washed off by the flood, according to reports. Almost 3,000 persons remain stranded in parts of this village. According to a local journalist, Shahaji Patil, many villagers are missing in flood. ""This has been happening for the last three days. Electricity is cut off. Thousands are stranded and many homes are under water, but there is no help from the government. There was a flood in 2005 also, but the current situation is horrible in terms of help from the government,"" he said.

According to local newspapers, 40,000 people are stranded in Walava teshil, 5,000 in Kolhapur city, 25,000 in Shirol tehshil, 3,000 in Ichalkaranji tehsil, so far. Now, teams of Indian Army along with seven teams of National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) have reached Shirol, Walava and Ichalkaranji. People are being rescued using boats from Kolhapur city as well as Shirol.

Both the districts ‚Äì Sangli and Kolhapur ‚Äì are the hubs of sugar and milk production in Maharashtra. So, these industries have taken a toll in the state, following the flood. ""People are trying to save their lives. There are reports that they have left their cattle at the cattle yards itself, as there is no help to transport them to the safer locations,"" said Vinayakrao Patil, former chairman of Mahananada, state's government-owned dairy brand. Gokul, which is Maharashtra's biggest brand of dairy products has declared that the milk collection will be closed for some days now. There is about 6.5 lakh litres of milk ready at the homes of the farmers, but due to flood, it is likely to go to waste.

Key Highlights 22 dead in Himachal Pradesh in the past 24 hours At least 17 dead in cloudburst in Uttarakhand Delhi faces flood as Yamuna breaches danger mark

New Delhi: After wreaking havoc in Assam and Bihar, the floods have now ravaged parts of north and south India. Just today, the Yamuna has breached the danger level in national capital threatening to displace thousands of residents residing in low lying areas.

Around 42 people have already died and 22 are still missing in Uttarakhand, Haryana and Punjab after heavy rains. These four states, including Delhi have been put in high alert.

Rains and floods in Himachal

Rains and floods claimed 22 lives in Himachal Pradesh in the past 24 hours. Incessant rainfall has also triggered landslides in parts of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand. Heavy rainfall is expected to continue today as well. Due to rains, flash floods and landslides, train services have also been disrupted in Kullu-Manali, and Shimla area.

A portion of a footbridge over the Sutlej river collapsed after the water level increased due to heavy rainfall in Chaba and Shimla.

Uttarakhand floods

At least 17 people have lost their lives as rescue operations are underway following a cloudburst in Mori Tehsil of Uttarkashi district. Over 20 people are reported missing due to the cloudburst that has left hundreds of people stranded in the area.



Alert in Haryana and Delhi

With the release of over 8 lakh cusec water from the Hathini Kund barrage into the Yamuna river, Haryana government has asked the Indian Army to remain on stand by for possible relief and rescue operation.

The water level of the Yamuna has crossed the ""warning mark"" in Delhi. The river is flowing at 204.70 meters, higher than the warning mark of 204.50 meters.

Meanwhile, the district magistrate of East Delhi has ordered the evacuation of residents living near the flood plains of Yamuna. According to officials, the water level is only expected to rise. The civil defence volunteers have been deployed to deal with any emergency situation.

Kerala flood situation

As rains caused havoc in Northern districts of Kerala, more than 50 people were trapped ever since the landslide hit the state. Rescuers have used ground-penetrating radar to dig out missing bodies from the site.

According to Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA), the death toll in the state has risen to 121 on Monday even as floodwaters continue to recede in several districts of Kerala.

Flood situation improves in Karnataka

Even as the situation improves in Karnaraka, the death toll has risen to 76 on Sunday. The floods devastated large parts of the state displacing thousands of people. Earlier, Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa met Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking immediate release of funds to take up relief work in the state.

Following Supreme Court‚Äôs directive to Centre to sort out water sharing dispute between Punjab and Haryana, Punjab is now of the view that it would stake claim on Yamuna waters if the state was pressured to share water with Haryana. Sources in the government said during two meetings with representatives of Haryana government in the past one month, Punjab stuck to its old stand that it did not have a drop to spare. Also, it reiterated the need for a fresh Tribunal to assess the availability of water.

Sources said state‚Äôs Haryana counterpart is also learnt to have raised its demand that Punjab should at least construct the remaining part of Sutlej Yamuna Link canal and the division of water could be dealt with later. But Punjab, on the other hand, is of the opinion that if the state does not have a drop to share then why should money be wasted on completing a canal.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

While parts of northern and southern India were struggling with drought-like conditions in the summer, the Northeast and western coastal areas have been battered with torrential downpour lately. Successive disasters have compelled us to turn our attention to the million-dollar question: Has climate crisis hit home?

According to weather website El Dorado, out of the 15 places that have received most rainfall across the globe in the last 24 hours, eight are in India. Naliya, a town in Gujarat, received a record 10.3 inch rainfall, followed by Okha (Gujarat, 6.54 inch), Rajkot (Gujarat, 5.83 inch), Mahabaleshwar (Maharashtra, 5.59 inch), Cochin (Kerala, 4.97 inch), Alappuzha (Kerala, 4.45 inch) and Kozhikode (Kerala, 4.57 inch).

Only two months back, the same weather listing source had counted four places in India among the world‚Äôs hottest 15 places.

Scientists agree that extreme weather conditions may most likely spike in the coming days. All these events couldn‚Äôt be put in a single bracket. However, one has to notice that there were some particularly extreme events that took place in a single day in many parts of the country, says Raj Bhagat Palanichamy, an earth observation expert with World Resources Institute, India.

Unfortunately, it is very difficult to predict such events. But the effects of such events would be higher in future due to loss of natural infrastructure as well as the ever-expanding human settlements. Even if the same number of events takes place in the country next year, the social and financial costs would be higher, Palanichamy added.

We'd like two minutes of your time in order to understand you better. Please take this reader survey.

Multi-decade rain deficit to rising temperatures have shaken up the usual weather patterns. The ministry of earth sciences, India, has also confirmed that the year 2018 was the sixth warmest year on record since nation-wide records commenced in 1901. However, it was lower than the warmest year of 2016 (+0.720C).

Last year, the mean temperature during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons were also above normal.

Chennai was the test case of drought when north and central India were facing a massive heat wave in June. After the public presser, the government announced a special 50-wagon train to import water from outlying districts. Chennai would get water from such arrangement till October.

But while Chennai in India‚Äôs eastern coast is waiting for proper monsoon, large swathes of land along the western coast have been hit by floods due to heavy rain. More than 64,000 people have been evacuated to 738 relief camps in Kerala, and property worth over Rs 1,000 crore damaged. This is the story of two neighbouring states.

The river Periyar in Kerala, one of the longest in India with immense discharge potential, is in a spate, along with other major rivers such as Bharathapuzha, Pamba and Wayanad. In Karnataka, the flood situation downstream to Kabini river, a tributary of Cauvery, and other rivers remain grim.

Palanichamy and other experts said that floods in northern and southern Karnataka and the Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu have been caused by extreme rainfall which these places haven‚Äôt witnessed in quite some time. Before the commencement of rainfall in this region, it was a potential drought-affected area. Over a single week, the dams are now full in Cauvery basin.

The timeline of extreme natural calamities started from May when a powerful cyclone roared through Odisha with wind speeds of up to 130 mph. It was the most dangerous storm in recent years.

India has about 4 per cent of the world‚Äôs freshwater resources and is counted among the top 10 water-rich countries. But it also scored as a water-stressed region.

According to the Working Group II report of the Fourth Assessment of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, India has been designated as a water-stressed region‚Äô with utilisable freshwater standing at 1,122 cubic metres (cu m) per year and per capita compared to international standards of 1,700 cu m.

A recent study shows that Himalayan glaciers, the main water source in India, are melting rapidly and likely to lead to severe droughts conditions in the northern states.

Scientists are divided on whether global warming is responsible for the change in Indian monsoon patterns. But climate crisis is a reality and being faced in the form of multi-decade rain deficit and flash floods.

All eyes are now on the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP) known as COP26 where more than 30,000 representatives across the globe would meet in Glasgow, UK, at the end of 2020 to decide on steps to curtail carbon emission which is one of the major factors responsible for climate crisis.",,2019 Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","August 8, 2019","August 17, 2019","Kerala, Karnataka",300 mm,"Rs 1,000 crore",48,"Thousands of people evacuated, 100,000 houses damaged",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red warning for heavy rain in the state for Sunday and Monday, directing the state and local authorities to step up action. Bihar, which is also India‚Äôs most flood prone state, has witnessed very heavy rainfall during the past two days.

On Saturday, the state received 84.5 mm rainfall against the normal of 5.7 mm. The highest rainfall was recorded in Samastipur, Bhagalpur, Begusarai, and Bhojpur districts, which received rainfall above 130 mm in last 24 hours.

According to the forecast, the rainfall is likely to remain intense over the next 24 hours and begin to decrease after Monday evening. Many rivers in North Bihar have been rising and are flowing close to the danger level. River Bagmati is flowing in severe flood situation and is expected to rise at Dheng Bridge, Runisaidpur in Sitamarhi district and Benibad in Muzzafarpur district, according to Central Water Commission (CWC).

River Ganga is flowing in severe flood situation at Dighaghat, Gandhighat, Hathidah, Munger, Bhagalpur and Kahalgaon in Patna, Begusarai, Munger and Bhagalpur districts, respectively, due to previous flood.

Severe flood in Ganga river could continue over the next two days, with IMD predicting heavy rains over East Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh during the next 24 hours. This could lead to additional contribution from both north and south bank tributaries for another three days.

Patna is among the worst affected, with flood-like situation in the city and its suburban areas.

‚ÄúSince the situation is likely to continue for at least another 24 hours, maximum vigil along the rivers as well as urban drains have to be maintained for sudden flood like situation in association with intense rain spells during the warning period,"" stated CWC in its latest update.

The ongoing monsoon season has been quite detrimental for the state, leading to floods after every brief spell of heavy rains in the state and neighboring Nepal, which leads to heavy inflow in the rivers of the state.

While, every monsoon season comes with its own set of variations, scientists highlight that extreme rainfall events are on the rise in the country on a long-term scale. There are longer dry spells, and more intense rainfall concentrated in fewer days.

This explains why Bihar was facing rain deficit of upto 20% until September 19. However, the current heavy rain spell brought down the rain deficit in the state to -2 %, as the monsoon season nears it closure.

Normally, monsoon begins to retreat around September 1. However, this year it is seeing a delay of over a month. At present, the overall monsoon remains excess to the tune of 9% over the entire country.

According to IMD, the withdrawal of monsoon from West Rajasthan could commence only during the second week of October, with probability of increased rainfall activity over west Rajasthan in the first week of October.

The underpass at IFFCO Chowk was flooded, a boundary wall in Udyog Vihar gave way causing three parked cars to slip into a construction site, and several areas were waterlogged ‚Äî all in the course of an hour as heavy rain lashed Gurgaon Friday. The city recorded 32 mm of rain till 5 pm.

According to officials, among the worst affected areas was the Golf Course Road, which houses several upscale gated condominiums, malls and offices. Waterlogging was reported at four major points along the stretch ‚Äî Genpact Chowk, Sikanderpur, AIT Chowk and the Ghata T-point. While commuters had to wade through ankle-deep water at Genpact Chowk, water had reached up to the bonnets of the cars at AIT Chowk.

Himanshu Garg, DCP (Traffic), said, ‚ÄúThere were instances of waterlogging across the city, including on Sikanderpur Power House Road, Jwala Mills Road and at AIT Chowk. We have a standard drill to respond to such situations, which includes ensuring enough personnel are deployed in these areas. Traffic movement was slow, but no traffic jams were reported as such.‚Äù

Even as most underpasses in the city remained clear despite the rain, the right turn underpass at IFFCO Chowk, where waterlogging had been reported last month, was inundated once again Friday. The structure had been opened to commuters only in March this year.

According to officials, although all pumps inside the underpass were operational, a strong gush of water flowed in from the direction of Sikanderpur and MG Road around 4 pm, burying the structure under water.

‚ÄúAs a result, a small section of the ramp leading out of the underpass also collapsed, and the walls and drains of the structure were damaged. We will have to close it for some time to carry out repair work,‚Äù said Saurabh Singhal, team leader and traffic transportation expert at Bloom Companies LLC, the NHAI consultant for the underpass.

‚ÄúWe have made provisions for pumps, but water that collects at Sikanderpur flows towards IFFCO Chowk via MG Road, and since the underpass is the lowest point, it gets collected there. It is difficult to pump it out because water keeps flowing in,‚Äù Singhal added.

‚ÄúThe water has been pumped out, but there is some silt remaining to be removed, which will be done in the morning. We expect to open the underpass by noon,‚Äù said Singhal.

Waterlogging was also witnessed at Sheetla Mata Mandir Road, Hanuman Chowk and Railway Road. Officials from the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), however, claimed that waterlogging at all areas under its jurisdiction had been cleared by 5 pm.

‚ÄúWater that had collected has been pumped out. We have permanent pumps installed at two vulnerable points ‚Äî one in Sector 28 and the other at Jwala Mills Road. In addition, we have four tractors with eight pumps,‚Äù said Lalit Arora, Superintending Engineer, GMDA. He said that it took ‚Äúaround an hour‚Äù to pump out water at AIT Chowk.

Normally the monsoon in north India recedes by the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month has been 37% above normal. If the situation continues for the remaining few days, it will be the latest the monsoon has ever receded in decades, according to experts in the India Meteorological Department.

Many areas of the country are still getting unprecedented rain, the latest being the town of Pune in western India, where torrential rain on Wednesday and Thursday caused several deaths and havoc from collapsed buildings.

Homes were flooded and people waded through streets with water up to their knees in scenes normally seen only at the height of the monsoon.

Other cities such as Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad have also experienced heavy rainfall. Uttarakhand state in the north has seen extensive damage to homes from the prolonged rains.

The monsoon was also late to arrive. Many areas suffered water shortages and farmers braced themselves for a possible drought.

The extended monsoon is not welcome among farmers. ‚ÄúThis amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year. It is making my vegetables ‚Äì I‚Äôve got cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes at the moment ‚Äì rot,‚Äù said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand.

For consumers, the impact of the delayed and now late-receding monsoon has meant a rise in the price in the price of onions, an essential ingredient in Indian food. Onions are selling at 80 rupees (about ¬£1) a kilo in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, as opposed to the normal 20 rupees (23p).

Festivals are also at risk. The next big festival is Dussehra on 8 October, when Hindus erect giant, comic book-style effigies of Ravana, a figure from the Hindu epic The Ramayana who sports a bushy moustache and an evil grin.

Burning Ravana symbolises the triumph of good over evil. But given that the effigies are made of paper, if the monsoon continues, Ravana might have the last laugh.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
delhi,2019,https://www.newsclick.in/Floods-India-Poor-Urban-Planning-Indian-Cities-No-Rainwater-Harvesting,28-Aug-19,Why Flooded Cities Are Becoming Common These Days,"Geetha, 21, held her one-and-a-half-year-old son, Dhruman, close to her, trying to save their lives from the rising waters, but in vain. When their bodies were discovered in Mallapuram district in Kerala, Geetha was holding on to her son tightly. Two sisters, Anagha and Aleena, who hugged each other every night before going to sleep, were buried together in a massive landslide in Nilambur town in Kerala. Similar heart-rending incidents of loved ones lost in the recent floods in the country have been reported.

Just in three states -- Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka -- 227 people have died in the floods and landslides and the number is expected to rise as there are a large number of missing persons. More than 350 deaths have been reported from across the country, including in Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar and Punjab. Over two lakh displaced people had to be shifted to because of inundation.

The economic loss is also colossal. It is estimated that every year there is a loss of over 3% of GDP (gross domestic product) due to floods. The Central Water Commission has estimated that from 1957 to 2017, a total of 1,07,457 people have died in floods and nearly Rs 3,68,868 crore loss of infrastructure has taken place owing to loss of houses, roads, bridges etc. In Maharashtra alone, the loss has been estimated at Rs 50,000 crore in the past two months. These losses include damage to property, loss of animals, dairy business and crops.

Flooded Cities

A large number of the cities have also gone under water. In fact, urban flooding is mainly due to poor drainage and faulty urban planning. The United Nations Environment Programme terms the flooding of cities as artificial and not natural. By artificial, it means that floods in cities happen because of the way infrastructure is designed in the cities, occupying the land mass and leaving little space for water sequestration, badly designed and constructed stormwater drains, which instead of collecting the storm water, spill it out on the roads and localities. Not to miss the absence of rainwater harvesting in the cities, which also leads to flooding.

Let us take the example of Delhi. There were 611 natural water bodies in the city, which were responsible for collecting rainwater and acted like reservoirs. Not just that, these were also able to maintain the ecological balance of the region. Out of the 611 water bodies, 190 are completely lost; either occupied by real estate or converted into parks. As many as 274 water bodies have dried up. There are various reasons for this. Either the water channels leading to these bodies have been infringed upon or there may be blockage in the drains that led water to these bodies. Interestingly, Delhi gets 580 million cubic litres of rainfall in the monsoon, of which nearly 300 million cubic litre gets drained off, creating flooding in the city.

Just a cursory look at three decades of old satellite maps of India‚Äôs capital city is enough to show how its water channels have been blocked. Gurgaon, which is in Haryana, but is part of the National Capital Region, is an interesting example of this. In Gurgaon, the water channels that led rainwater to two major lakes have completely been blocked. Recollect the shooting of a television serial, Fauji, which led to the projection of Shah Rukh Khan as an actor. The lake around which the shoots were done and in which he had nearly drowned, were not completely dry then.

With the construction of flyovers, housing projects and the Metro, the natural channels of water have been blocked, leading to massive flooding in Gurgaon, which houses many residential high-rises and office complexes. It is a living example of a city being built without a master plan. The city was developed initially by a private developer and then the master plan was created. Delhi, at least, has a master plan which is getting updated this year.

Project-Based Approach

After the 1990s, the initiatives of successive governments have been to achieve the desired growth in cities by developing projects instead of a policy shift in development, which should have been to integrate many agencies working on the ground. JNNURM (Jawahar Lal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission), RAY (Rajeev Awas Yojana) followed by the SCM (Smart City Mission), AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) etc., speak speak the same language of project-driven urbanisation.

The new Andhra Pradesh capital in Amravati is another disaster in the offing, as urban experts‚Äô term it. The capital is being constructed on low-lying areas where there are a large number of water bodies. Amravati will be the future Chennai, they say, and this was proved recently when, as reported in the press, water entered the compound of the former chief minister Chandrababu Naidu‚Äôs residence.

Multiplicity of Agencies

Urban flooding is not just a problem of planning but also of multiplicity of urban governance agencies. Each city has a different governance structure. Some smaller cities are left to manage garbage, and infrastructure projects are done by some state government-run parastatals. Whereas in some other cities, there are many tiers of ownership and governance with regard to infrastructure. Take, for example, Delhi. Rainwater dropping from the top of a Metro track, owned by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (a 50:50 joint venture between the Delhi government and the Union urban development ministry), falls on the road, is taken care of by the Delhi government and eventually enters the stormwater drains managed by the municipal corporation. None speaks to each other. In many places one finds that the water from the Metro tracks does not fall through drain pipes, rather falls directly on the road and damages it. A simple way of integration could have been to harvest the rainwater directly from the Metro track and use it suitably. But without integration of governance, such a system cannot evolve.

Another major problem is related to construction of stormwater drains. Take the example of Shimla, a hill city. In the British era, stormwater drains were constructed with embankments of stone. This was done to ensure that water does not gush into the drain and percolates slowly to avoid flooding and also to recharge a large number of water springs in the vicinity. Recently, the Asian Development Bank funded a ‚Äòbeautiful city‚Äô project in Shimla. The worst that could have happened in the beautification plan is the covering of storm water drains with concrete and porcelain.

This has made the main Mall Road cleaner, but at the cost of increasing the velocity of water in the larger drains, which causes flooding. Similarly, in the ‚Äòlevel‚Äô cities, the best method of constructing a drain is to concretise it, which then gets filled with muck and the water, instead of moving ahead, spills over on the roads and various localities. In Delhi, there are a large number of examples of such construction of drains.

What is to be Done?

Suptendu Biswas, an urban planner, points out that exactly 50 years ago, a book titled, Design With Nature, authored by Ian McHarg, was published, which emphasised on multifunctional landscape design paradigms. It focuses on natural, social and cultural processes and sees design as an iterative process that is shaped by interactions between humans and ecosystems. Biswas says that the planners have forgotten the essence of this approach of bringing the community and the diverse aspects of the landscape planning together.

Urban planning has become a mechanical process, which is extremely dangerous. John Closs, the former executive director of UN Habitat III, has said several times that we have to go back to the basics of planning and need to get rid of the laissez faire, i.e., the market will dominate the planning process.

The role of the State in guaranteeing ample number of planners to the field cannot be ruled out. Romi Khosla, a well-known city planner, says it is known that there is a shortage of planners and architects in cities, especially in smaller towns. He suggests a national service by the pass-outs from the planning and architecture colleges. For at least one year, as part of the internship programme, they should be sent to smaller towns to prepare their land use and infrastructure plans. This will be a win-win situation for both the cities and the students. The interface will help students understand the basics of planning better.

There are also examples of the citizens partnerships. One such example is the passion in which one million (10 lakh) wells are being dug in Bangalore by the traditional communities of the region. These wells are in the backyard of the houses, which will be filled with rainwater. This shall serve a twin purpose -- using the rainwater effectively and reducing flooding of streets.

Another example is the five kilometres stretch of nullah converted into a cleaner water stream and a walking space in Gurgaon. The technology is simple; it uses the storm water to recharge the nullah and the earlier sewer water flowing in to the nullah has been blocked and treated. The place has now become a walker‚Äôs paradise.

There are several such initiatives by citizen groups, but these are insufficient to meet the scale that we are talking about. That scale can only be filled by effective integration of planning, execution, governance, transparency and accountability. And, it is the State that needs to act on it.

NEW DELHI, July 18 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation continued to be grim in several parts of India, particularly eastern state of Bihar, north-eastern state of Assam and parts of northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

Though official estimates were yet to be made, media reports claimed that the number of people died in the flood-affected areas was almost 100, while more than 8 million people were displaced and were given refuge in shelter homes or relief camps.

Food, clothes, medicines and other necessities were provided to the flood-affected by the respective state governments.

Flash floods in Bihar were mainly caused by torrential rains in the catchment areas of Nepal over the weekend.

An official source in Bihar State Disaster Management Department told Xinhua over phone that so far 33 people have died due to floods in the state, while nearly 2.7 million people were affected. A maximum of 11 deaths were reported from Sitamarhi district.

However, media reports put the death toll at around 70 in Bihar alone. ""State's Principal Secretary Prataya Amrit, who is the in-charge of state's Disaster Management Department, is holding a crucial meeting with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over the prevailing flood situation in the state. Most probably we will come out with the latest figures of human deaths and people affected by the evening,"" said an official source.

More than 125,000 people were evacuated from the flood-affected areas and rehabilitated in around 221 relief camps set up by the state government.

As many as 26 teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Indian Air Force (IAF), Indian Army, Indian Navy, and other state agencies were pressed into service to carry out relief and rescue work. Besides, around 423 boats were used to reach out to the flood-affected people with relief materials and other necessities.

Though water-levels in some areas started receding, normal life was adversely affected due to floods while household belongings were washed away by the floods.

The situation was equally bad in Assam, where as many as 28 people died due to floods and two others died in separate incidents of landslides caused due to floods.

Around 6 million people in over 4,000 villages in the state were affected in the floods, an official in the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) told Xinhua over phone.

A total of 427 relief camps were set up in the flood-affected districts.

Official sources in the ASDMA said that as much as 90 percent of the world-famous ""Kaziranga National Park"" in Golaghat and Nagaon districts of the state was submerged in flood-waters. The national park was home to the world's largest population of Indian one-horned rhinoceroses.

In a related development, a red alert was sounded in southern state of Kerala which has been witnessing ""extremely heavy rains."" Among the districts where red alert was sounded were Idukki, Malappuram, Wayanad, Kannur, Ernakulam and Thrissur.

Around 400 people died in the southern coastal state last year when it was hit by devastating floods, the worst in over a century.",flood,2019 North Indian floods,India,17-07-2019,18-07-2019,"['Bihar', 'Assam', 'Uttar Pradesh']",Heavy,8 million people displaced,100+,Normal life adversely affected,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Heavy rains lashed northern states with an alert sounded in Punjab following release of excess water from Bhakra dam and the Yamuna nearing the danger mark in Delhi, while normalcy was slowly returning to flood-ravaged Kerala, where so far 113 people have lost their lives.

Andhra Pradesh too received heavy showers, with a swollen Krishna river leaving 87 villages and hundreds of acres of farm land under a sheet of water in two districts.

NDRF personnel retrieved the body of a girl who drowned in the swollen river in Krishna district, taking the death toll to two in the state.

After touching a maximum of 8.21 lakh cusecs in the early hours of the day, the flood discharge at Prakasam Barrage in Vijayawada has fallen to 7.99 lakh cusecs at 10 am while the inflow remained steady at 7.57 lakh cusecs, the State Real-Time Governance Centre said.

Even the discharges from upstream reservoirs showed a declining trend but the travails of more than 17,500 people in 87 villages under 32 mandals in Krishna and Guntur districts may continue for the next two days.

In all 11,553 people in the two districts have been moved to 56 relief camps where food and drinking water are being provided.

State Governor Biswabhusan Harichandan conducted an aerial survey of the flood-hit areas of Krishna, while ministers visited the marooned localities in Vijayawada city and supervised the relief measures.

The body of a 17-year-old boy was found floating in the overflowing dam in Himachal Pradesh, where several roads were blocked following multiple landslides.

All educational institutions in Kangra district have also been asked to remain closed on Saturday due to incessant rainfall. Several people stranded near Palampur following flash floods were rescued. There is heavy flow of water in Baner Khud and Baan Ganga adjoining Chamunda Ji and the water level in rivulets in Nurpur sub division is on the rise as well, an official said.

In Punjab, an alert has been sounded in several districts following the release of excess water from Bhakra dam through the spill gates after heavy rainfall in its catchment area.

The Bhakra Beas Management Board authorities discharged 17,000 cusecs of excess water out of total release of 53,000 cusecs through the spill gates, an official said. The remaining 36,000 cusecs was released after its use for power generation, he added. On Saturday, rains lashed several places in Punjab, including Ludhiana, Amritsar, Mohali, Chandigarh.

People living near the Sutlej river and low-lying areas have been advised to be vigilant and take precautions to safeguard themselves.

With the Yamuna also flowing near the danger level, Delhi agencies are closely monitoring the situation to deal with any possible flooding, an official said. Yamuna's water level reached 203.27 metres, slightly below the warning level of 204.5 metres, an official said. The official said at 10 am, over 21,000 cusecs water was released from Hathani Kund Barrage in Haryana. Besides, around 17,000 cusecs water was also released from the barrage.

In Rajasthan, hundreds of people were shifted to safer places, with Ajmer, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Vanasthali, Bhilwara and Sikar receiving 104.5 mm, 88.2, 79, 42.1,41 and 37.4 mm of rainfall. The MeT Department has issued warning for extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places in eastern parts and heavy rainfall at isolated places in the western parts of the state.

People have started moving to their homes from relief camps in Kerala, even as the toll climbed to 113, with authorities retrieving more bodies from the landslide hit districts of Malappuram and Wayanad.

Fifty people have so far lost their lives in Malappuram and 12 in Wayanad, the two northern districts, where 28 people are still missing.

Search operations are continuing at Kavalappara in Malappuram and Puthumala in Wayanad, the two areas which were the worst hit in the second spell of south west monsoon rains since August 8, where massive landslides had wiped out two villages.

Kolkata, which is being battered by torrential rains, received 186.1 mm rainfall in the past 24 hours and the forecast is of more rains in the city.

Vehicular traffic was disrupted in several areas of central, south and north Kolkata, resulting in traffic snarls.

Flight operations were also affected, as take-off and landing was delayed, said a senior official of the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport.

Meanwhile, in neighbouring Assam, nearly 18,505 people in six districts have been hit by floods till late Sunday.

Districts of Karbi Anglong, West KarbiAnglong and Hojai are the worst hit due to the floods, while landslides damaged as many as 78 houses in Dima Hasao district.

MS Manivannan, the chief executive officer of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority, said Dhansiri and Kopili rivers swelled after incessant rainfall.

Two days ago, excessive rainfall led to the officials releasing water from the reservoirs of the Kopili Hydel Project in Dima Hasao district, according to Manivannan.

On Monday, while Kopili water levels stabilised, Dhansiri river was still flowing above the danger mark.‚ÄúThe situation is under control but itcould turn critical in Golaghat for example if water is released from theDoyang Hydro Electric Project in Nagaland,‚Äù said MS Manivannan adding that personnel of the National Disaster Response Force have been moved to Golaghat.

Over 1,000 small and large animals were also killed due to the flooding.It was for the third successive night that the city experienced something like a cloudburst.While the city received 53.1mm of rain in 12 hours on the day, the bulk of it came in the two-hour span from 9pm onwards. It had rained 46.9mm in one hour on Monday night and 78.3mm between 8.30pm on Tuesday and 8.30am on Wednesday. The city had witnessed a similar intense, convective spell on July 19, which brought 28.8mm rain in barely 45 minutes.Roads turned into rivers while nullahs overran their banks, washing away culverts and small bridges. The city‚Äôs drainage system seemed nonfunctional as gushing water on the roads swept away scores of cars, motorcycles and scooters, ripped out paver blocks from pavements and eroded the road surface in several places.Among the dead or missing were people returning home from work. A man died in his Honda City car after it was swept away into a nullah off Sinhagad Road near the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway; just across the same nullah, a young woman on her scooter was similarly washed away; and, a young working professional driving back home in his Tata Tiago car was still missing along with the vehicle after he encountered the raging waters of a nullah near Ganga Satellite society at Wanowrie, not far from the Pune racecourse.The administration did not have much to offer for being caught off-guard.

However, traffic through the tunnel was restored on Friday morning.In Pune city, the downpour hit power supply to around 1.25 lakh consumers in different areas. Three transformers were uprooted, electricity poles were damaged and feeder pillars were submerged. In the district, five transformers were washed away in Khed, Nasrapur and Shivapur.Water supply was affected in some areas after rain water gushed into a few pumping stations. These areas are unlikely to get water on Friday. Nearly 25,000 landline connections of the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited were affected due to the flooding. Two pipelines of the Maharashtra Natural Gas Limited (MNGL) suffered damages, affecting around 1,200 customers.A heavy downpour in the catchment area of the Nazare dam, around 50km from Pune, led to a huge release of water into the Karha river late on Wednesday night.

NEW DELHI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed and around 900,000 affected by floods in India's northeastern state of Assam, officials said Saturday.

""Nearly 900,000 people are affected in the recent wave of floods across 21 districts of the state,"" a local government official said. ""So far six people have lost their lives in the flooding.""

According to officials, several rivers including the Brahmaputra river, one of the largest rivers in the world, are flowing above danger due to incessant rains and water has inundated several places.

Authorities have pressed disaster response force personnel in the affected areas for search, relief and rescue operation.

""At present, 68 relief camps are operational, where affected people have taken refuge,"" the official said. ""Food items and drinking water bottles are being distributed among flood-hit people.""

Apart from flooding, landslides have also been reported that has affected the road and rail connectivity at several places.

""Train communication between Lumding and Silchar remains cut off due to landslide in Dima Hasao district and efforts are on to restore it,"" the official said.

Reports said floodwaters have entered Kaziranga National Park in Upper Assam, forcing wild animals to take shelter on platforms constructed for their safety during flood.

Kaziranga National Park is home to endangered one-horned rhinoceros.

Officials said over 27,000 hectares of farmland are under floodwater.

delhi,2019,https://www.newsclick.in/Kerala-Floods-Rainfall-Amicus-Curiae-Report,04-Apr-19,"Kerala Floods: Extreme Rainfall Was a Major Cause, Says Amicus Curiae Report","New Delhi: The excessive rainfall that had not been anticipated was the major cause of the devastating floods in Kerala last year, said the report filed by the Amicus Curiae appointed by the state high court. Above normal rainfall, more than 42%, during June-August 2018, and extremely heavy rainfall on August 15-17, 2018 caused unprecedented floods resulting in massive loss of life and property across Kerala.

The amicus curiae report portrayed various factors that aggravated the impact of floods. None of the 79 dams in Kerala were operated or used for the purpose of flood control/ moderation; no effective flood control zone is maintained; high reservoir storage even in the first week of August; sudden release of water from all dams; reduced reservoir storage capacity due to siltation; no integrated operation of dams based on scientifically identified Rule Curves, absence of proper Flood Warning etc are some of them, according to sources.

‚ÄúSince the state does not have the history of frequent flood or flood-like situation,

the dams across the state are maintained with a primary objective of power generation and irrigation,‚Äù said a source from state disaster management authority.

‚ÄúIn fact, certain studies have earlier pointed out the effectiveness of the Idukki dam which had somewhat succeeded in controlling the flow of water in river Periyar‚Äù, the source added.

The 49-page report that was filed by the Amicus Curiae advocate Jacob P Alex recommended a more detailed enquiry by appointing an independent expert committee headed by a former judge of the Supreme Court and preferably consisting of a reputed hydrologist, experts in dam management, engineers and other experts.

Meanwhile, leading media organisations in the state, along with the Opposition, tried to portray that report had blamed the opening of dam gates for causing the floods, with an eye on the ongoing election campaign.

While Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday termed these as ‚Äúfalse allegations‚Äù by the Opposition and media, detailing statistics, he said it was up to the courts to accept or reject the Amicus Curiae report.

Though the report is based on four studies that clearly state the causes behind the floods, the opposition is using it as tool for the upcoming parliamentary elections.

The studies that have been quoted in the report are ‚ÄúStudy report-Kerala Floods of August 2018‚Äù by Hydrology Directorate, Central Water Commission (CWC); ‚ÄúRole of dams on the floods of August 2018 in Periyar River Badin, Kerala‚Äù by Sudhir KP of IIT Chennai and others; ‚ÄúThe Kerala Flood of 2018: combined impact of extreme rainfall and reservoir storage‚Äù by Vimal Mishra of IIT Gandhinagar and others and ‚ÄúRole of Dams in Kerala‚Äôs Flood Disaster‚Äù by Himanshu Thakkar of South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, Delhi, opposition

Read More: ""Kerala has Received Widespread Acclaim for its Handling of Dam Systems""

The main findings of the CWC study detailed that the time required for water from farthest point of the catchment area of most of the reservoirs in Kerala to reach the catchment outlet is about 2 to 3 hours. Clearly, the total rainfall in Kerala between August 1, 2018 and August 19, 2018 was 164% above normal. Further, during August 15-17, the three-day rainfall depths realised in Periyar, Pampa, Chalakkudi and Bharathappuzha sub-basins was very high, similar to that of the 1924 rainfall.

More importantly, the CWC study said that dams in Kerala neither added to the flood nor helped in reduction of floods, as most of these were already at FRL (full reservoir level) or very close to FRL on August 14, 2018 due to more than normal rainfall in June to July 2018. In any case it would have been necessary to release water from the reservoirs after first day of extreme rainfall.

The CWC report also added that the release of reservoirs had only a minor role in flood augmentation as the released volume was almost similar to inflow volumes. Even, with the 75 percentage filled reservoirs conditions, the current flood could not have been mitigated as one day rainfall in majority of the area was more than 200 mm and severe rainfall continued for 3 to 4 days.

One other major allegation against the state government is that they did not follow the directions from the centre monitoring systems. But the report only says that ‚Äúdam managers ought not to have ‚Äòsolely‚Äô relied on IMD predictions for dam management and variations in IMD forecast or prediction cannot be counted as a justification for delayed release of water from dams‚Äù. It clearly says that state government should not have waited for IMD which is the authority to warn about heavy rains. This itself points to the argument of Kerala government that IMD forecast was not accurate.

Though on August 7 and 8, 2018, there was no heavy rain forecast. From August 8 morning, the state had been witnessing massive rains. On August 9, the gates of most of the dams, including Idukki, had been opened. When the deadly flood hit the state on August 14, the water flow from the dams were under control.

A week later, the National Capital remains in tears‚Äô as prices of the second most consumed vegetable after potato are still burning a hole in people‚Äôs pockets. On Friday, the wholesale price range was Rs 25-35 a kg.

The retail price hovered between Rs 60 and Rs 70. This is more than double the normal rate. Suresh Kumar, a retailer in Delhi‚Äôs Paharganj, said, ""The export ban and Navratra have had some impact. However, the prices are yet to stabilise after the past few days witnessed a steep increase."" Several online shopping portals are selling onion at an offer price of Rs 57 per kg if 5 kgs are purchased. Such a price rise disrupts people‚Äôs daily budget. An average household spends 13% of its total vegetable expenditure on onions, shows

government data.

I have stopped using onion in salads. In fact, I have stopped cooking vegetables that require onion, said Pratishtha, a 29-year-old mother of two.

FLOOD FACTOR

The floods in onion-producing states such as Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Assam have been a big factor. ""Farmers in Maharashtra have suffered huge crop losses due to floods. Hence, supplies from onion hotspot Nashik to our city have shrunk, resulting in a sharp price rise,"" said Vishnu Prasad, a wholesaler in Delhi‚Äôs Azadpur Mandi. Nashik trader Hiraman Pardeshi said farmers have suffered crop damages for three consecutive years. They threw onions on roads last year. Two farmers committed suicide in Nashik. An intense heat wave was also a factor. Now, farmers say that the price rise is a compensation for their three years of losses.""

CAPITAL HOARDING

But floods are not the only factor. Many traders in Delhi resorted to large-scale, pre-festival hoarding, a fact that the Delhi government acknowledged at a review meeting chaired by its Food and Civil Supplies Minister Imran Hussain on Friday. He ordered a crackdown on hoarding and black-marketing of onion and directed the department and other agencies to intensify field inspections. Enforcement teams will also check the implementation of stock limits and violators may strictly be proceeded against as per provisions of law, said a Delhi government spokesperson. The Centre‚Äôs stock limits to check wholesale prices that had spiked to an alarming six-year high are 100 quintals and 500 quintals for retailers and wholesale traders, respectively.

CONSUMPTION DOWN

High prices have lowered daily consumption, from 3,000 tonnes to 2,000. The number of onion trucks coming to Azadpur Mandi every day has reduced to 40-50 from 125-150. We normally see some decrease in demand during Navratra. But not this much, Prasad said. At Delhi‚Äôs Ghazipur Mandi too, the number of daily onion trucks has come down from 25-30 to about 15.

CONSUMERS CRY

Residents, however, are not impressed by the claims of the government and traders. Dharmendra Kaushik, said: The price rise burden is always transferred to consumers. The government tells us that it is making efforts but officials hardly conduct raids on warehouses. Suman Yadav, a resident of Delhi‚Äôs Model Town said: ""The claim of wholesalers is just an eyewash. They deliberately stock onion to make more money during festivals,

POLL HOT POTATO

Rising onion prices were cited as the reason Congress defeated BJP in the 1998 Delhi elections. Again in 2010, per kg onion price in Delhi soared from Rs 35 to Rs 88. Congress, however, managed to retain power. On his part, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has flagged off mobile vans to supply onion at Rs 23.90 per kg, warning of strict action against hoarding and black-marketing. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari, however, accused the Kejriwal government of earning profit by selling onion at Rs 23.90 per kg after buying it from the Centre at Rs 15.90 per kg. He also said that the AAP government had failed to check ""black-marketing"" of onion. AAP immediately hit back.

""The rates at which we will get onion and the rates at which subsidised onion is sold are decided by his own central government. We would be happy if he could help in reducing those rates further,"" AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said. Congress also blamed AAP for the crisis. ""When Congress, under Sheila Dikshit, was in power in Delhi, it used to take advanced steps to ensure there is no shortage of onion at any point of time. This government is only interested in optics and does nothing on ground,"" said Congress leader Haroon Yusuf.

WHAT NEXT

Many traders are optimistic that prices will come down soon. Non-consumption will result in huge stocks that will have to be cleared. It will automatically bring down prices, said Ghazipur Mandi trader Mohd Amir.

Local reports suggest that many people died after they were hit by collapsing trees and walls.

The severity of the floods could be gauged from the fact that Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi and his family could be rescued only after three days in the state capital, Patna. Popular Singer Sharda Sinha was also rescued after rains stopped on Monday.

Mahender Yadav, an activist told NewsClick that in Patna, a smart city in making, the heavy downpour had exposed the lies behind the Municipal Corporation‚Äôs repeated claims of smooth drainage. ‚ÄúWater logging has created havoc and a flood like situation in Patna"", he added.

Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has predicted no rains in Patna on Monday but predicted rains, but not heavy, in some districts of North Bihar.

According to local weather department officials, Patna recorded 226 mm rain in the past 36 hours followed by 210 mm in Vaishali, 154 mm in Bhagalpur, 164 mm in Purnea and 106 mm in Gaya districts. The highest rainfall of 290 mm was recorded in Rosra in Samastipur.

The flooding in state's capital has left many persons worried about depleting stocks of essential items.

Kaushiki Kashyap, a journalist working in a private media house in Noida, told NewsClick that her family was stranded since the past four days. ""The rain started pouring at slow rate. We thought it would lead to normalcy soon. But the roads soon submerged. Homes too became flooded forcing families to take shelter on upper floors and roofs. My family too has taken shelter at my mother's sister‚Äôs home. They have kept their phones shut in order to save power as electricity is being cut frequently. A big worry is over depleting stocks of ration and other essential items. When 20 people are living together, ration is a big concern. Most shops are also inundated.""

Kashyap said the present situation could be attributed to years of unbridled construction and mismanagement by municipal authorities. ‚ÄúBahadur Nagar is an area known for its coaching centres. We have seen the area submerging even in a day's outpouring. This was bound to happen."" Bihar witnessed floods thrice this year.

Pushya Mitra, senior journalist, also a resident of Patna, blamed central and state government inaction for the present situation. ‚ÄúIt is correct that the city saw unplanned constructions and expansion over the years and it has cost us severely. Patna had 1,022 water bodies and ponds 30 years ago. Now the number has reduced to 500 now. Where did 522 ponds go? Obviously, they were encroached to pave way for construction. These ponds stored a significant amount of water during floods. Now, all water is in streets,‚Äù he told Newsclick.

Citing another example, he said Patna had received 321 mm rains in the past three days and it lies submerged. ‚ÄúIn 1967, the city received 271 mm rain in a single day and everything was normal. Similarly, we found that city's 30 out of 38 pump houses were not functioning due to errand reasons. It was the responsibility of disaster management authorities to prepare for the situation but they have miserably failed,"" he added.

Mitra also anticipated a tragedy in making if rescue arrangements are not stepped up. He said,"" NDRF has only 33 boats for rescuing people. How can you rescue thousands of people with this much logistics? I received a call from girls studying at a private coaching firm. They were asked by the warden to vacate the hostel. So, they left the hostel amidst heavy rains. I do not know about their present status.""

Asked about the possible role of the Farakka dam in the floods, he said,"" Farakka stops the flow of Ganga during floods. But the question is only raised by the parties when they are in Opposition. Once they ally with the ruling party, they opt for silence over it.""

Farakka dam, built in 1974, has been in controversy over its role in flooding in Bihar. A warning had even come from West Bengal's former Chief Engineer Kapil Bhattacharya who cautioned that the dam was badly designed to keep the water stored in the barrage in a flood situation. In a report, Silting of Calcutta Port, he said: ""If my warnings against Farakka Barrage are not heeded, people will have to suffer consequences.""

Himanshu Thakkar, an environmentalist associated with South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, told Newsclick that the Central Water Commission must take responsibility for continuous floods in Bihar. He said,"" Farakka Dam actually works like a bottleneck for a large river like Ganga. When Ganga swells during the monsoon, the water cannot drain out as per natural flow. Simultaneously, the tributaries too get swollen and water spreads along backwaters. When the question of silt caused by Farakka was brought for discussion by a committee of Ministry of Water Resources to resolve the situation, the Central Water Commission informed the committee that it has no data regarding silting, be it for the period before Farakka or sufficient data for the post-construction period. So, the situation remains same every year in lack of data and resolution.""

Meanwhile, in the state capital, it is the elderly and the poor who are suffering the most. Some senior citizens in Patna recall that such a situation of water logging was last witnessed 45 years ago. ‚ÄùFor youths, it may be something new, but a similar situation was witnessed in mid-70s in Patna‚Äù Krishnakant Ojha, an activist told Newsclick.

The incessant rains also led to cancellation of 11 flights and diversion of nine from the Mumbai airport.

Overnight downpours caused havoc in adjoining Thane district also, where the Mahalaxmi Express got stuck near Badlapur due to flooded tracks.

The train left Mumbai for Kolhapur on Friday night, but could not travel beyond Chamtoli where it is stranded since the early hours of Saturday, an official said.

""Due to a raging Ulhas river, the Mahalaxmi Express train got stuck at Chamtoli within the limits of Badlapur due to flooded tracks. The passengers were safe, but the only concern is rise in water level on the tracks,"" Resident Deputy Collector (Thane) Shivaji Patil said.

Maharashtra government spokesperson Brajesh Singh said eight NDRF boats have been deployed.

""The rescue work was underway and at least 100 people have been shifted to safer places from low-lying areas,"" he added.

While Thane city recorded 160 mm rainfall till 8 am Saturday, Murbad recorded 332 mm, while Kalyan, Ulhasnagar and Amberanth recorded over 200 mm of rainfall each , an official release from the district collectorate said.

The order says the interim lines will be mapped in consultation with local residents and officials on the basis of an ‚Äòobserved flood line‚Äô of that river. And, these lines will be valid for a year until the final flood line gets mapped.

The GR states: ‚ÄúThe mapped blue interim flood lines will be finalised by the concerned chief engineer of the water resources department. Following this, 50-meter area from the interim blue line will be considered as no-development zone. The urban development department will independently issue regulatory orders for the same banning construction here.‚Äù

The blue lines will be valid for a year until the final flood lines get mapped.

This order comes on the heels of a high court hearing on a public interest litigation filed by NGO Vanshakti against the government. The PIL demanded the state finalise flood lines and make them sacrosanct from rampant construction and encroachments to avoid disasters. In the hearing, the government was asked to decide interim measures and policy to protect the flood plains until the final lines were notified.

‚ÄúWe have demanded that flood plains of all rivers in the state and Mithi (that‚Äôs a separate petition) be marked. And, these areas should be completely no go to avoid ecological devastation and disasters. We had suggested that half the width of the river on both sides be considered as the flood line and be considered as no-development zone. This 50-m mark from interim flood line is an arbitrary decision. It has probably been taken only to avoid ire of the judiciary,‚Äù said petitioner and environmentalist Stalin D of Vanshakti.

An official from the water resources department said, ‚ÄúWe realised that demarcating the final flood lines is going to take time, so we have said wherever it is not done, do a quicker interim exercise to avoid further encroachments as asked by the court.‚Äù The water resources department has guidelines to demarcate flood lines since 1989, which were amended in 2018. The guidelines refer to drawing artificial red line and blue line in a river area. The blue line is marked considering maximum flood discharge in 25 years, while the red line is marked considering maximum floods in over 100 years. The area between the blue line and the river bank is ‚Äòprohibitive zone‚Äô where no development is to be allowed and area between the red line and the blue line is considered as ‚Äòrestrictive zone‚Äô where development is restricted.

‚ÄúThis year, over 8.28 lakh cusecs of water has been released and out of it, over 3 lakh cusecs of water is expected to reach our jurisdiction. We have the capacity of handling a maximum of 3.50 lakh of cusecs water. But if the water exceeds beyond this, we could be in trouble. All the villagers living on the banks have been alerted,‚Äù MN Upadhayay, additional district magistrate (finance), said.

The administration has set up 12 flood posts in the district along with control rooms in Greater Noida and Noida. The district flood task force also held a meeting with all the concerned officials on Monday to prepare for any possible flood-like situation.

Residents living on the banks of Hindon river have been asked to be on alert as well. ‚ÄúIf the water level is too high in Yamuna, the water can then flow into Hindon and cause damage. We had a meeting with the irrigation department which informed us that since the region received good rainfall this year time, less water will be absorbed by natural water resources like ponds and other low-lying areas before it reaches GB Nagar,‚Äù Upadhayay added.

Villages like Kambakshpur, Yakubpur, Momnathal and Safipur are on a high alert. These villages are more prone to flood as they are situated on the bank of Yamuna.

All the lekhpals, sarpanch, SDMs, officials from the irrigation department and local bodies are keeping an eye on the situation.

‚ÄúOur officials are working round the clock to ensure safety of villagers. The water level is expected to rise higher on Tuesday evening. It takes around 72 hours for water to reach Yamuna in the district,‚Äù the ADM said.",flood,2022 Uttar Pradesh Floods,"Uttar Pradesh, India",28-Jul-22,Present,"['Greater Noida', 'Noida', 'Kambakshpur', 'Yakubpur', 'Momnathal', 'Safipur']",8.28 lakh cusecs,Not yet known,Not yet known,Villages on the banks of Yamuna and Hindon rivers are on high alert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari on Wednesday launched a flood relief donation camp for his home state Bihar, where at least 42 people have died in rain-related incidents following a torrential spell that took place between September 27 and 30.

The development comes amid his party's attack on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal accusing him of ""humiliating"" people from Bihar and Purvanchal.

The chief minister recently claimed that the long queues at Delhi government hospitals were due to patients from other states and cited the name of Bihar in this context.

Tiwari hit back accusing Kejriwal of ""humiliating"" people from other states, including Purvanchalis, the Bhojpuri speaking natives of Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh.

On Wednesday, Bihar continued to trudge towards normalcy with intensified rescue and relief operations and water being pumped out of submerged localities.

In Delhi's politics, the Purvanchalis hold sway accounting for around one-third population of the city as per unconfirmed estimates.

With Assembly elections, scheduled early next year, inching closer, political rivals the BJP and the AAP have been making efforts to win over the Purvanchali voters.

Tiwari will visit Bihar to hand over the relief material, said Delhi BJP media relations head, Neelkant Bakshi.

""Tiwari himself contributed to the fund which will be run through social media and internet to collect fund globally,"" Bakshi said. Former AAP MLA Kapil Mishra, who recently joined the BJP, will oversee the fund collection with the help of his aide Vikas Pandey.

Splurge and save now! Click here

‚ÄúThe flood water first entered Jahangirpuri and then started spreading to other locations. Soon, the administration began evacuating residents from lowlying areas. As a precautionary measure, I had sent my family to a relative‚Äôs place working in Hindu Rao hospital. Soon, Azadpur and Model Town were under five-feet water,‚Äù said Dimri, a retired government teacher.

The intensity of the water and breaches in embankments submerged 43 square kilometres (sqkm) of agricultural land, mostly in outer Delhi, under two metres of water. The surge destroyed the kharif crop, caused extensive damage to properties and displaced lakhs of residents.

Including Model Town and Jahangirpuri, breaches in two embankments ‚Äì the right marginal bund and left marginal bund ‚Äì caused flooding in Indiranagar, Majlis Park, Gopal Nagar, Alipur, Mukherjee Nagar, Kingsway Camp, Delhi University, Adarsh Nagar, Civil Lines, Bela Road, Okhla, Sarai Kale Khan and Maharani Bagh.

The spillover from the Najafgarh drain also submerged Janakpuri, Hasthsal, Uttam Nagar, Pankha Road, Vishnu Garden and 72 villages in Najafgarh and the adjoining areas.

Flood waters entered Shanti Van and Vijay Ghat.

It was not the first time that the city was deluged. But it was worst-ever flood Delhi had witnessed. At that time, the river was flowing 2.66 metres above the danger mark at the Purana Pul (old railway bridge). The level touched the 207.49-metre mark, which still remains unbeatable.

Since then, the water level has breached the 207-metre mark only twice ‚Äî in 2010 (207.11 metres) and 2013 (207.32 metres).

The danger mark (207.73 metres) was set according to the height of the old rail bridge over the Yamuna, which opened in 1866-67. The embankments that existed back then were good to hold only low-intensity flooding.

‚ÄúWork on embankments that stand today started around the 1960-70s. When the 1978 floods struck, they were still not strengthened. Water entered several low-lying areas through breaches at locations,‚Äù said Omesh Saigal, former chief secretary of Delhi who held the charge of secretary, planning, in the Delhi administration in 1977-78.

Prior to the construction of the right marginal and left marginal embankments, the river used to inundate the trans-Yamuna areas and other parts nearly every year. The flooding of the monastery market along Ring Road near Kashmere Gate was a signal that river water was on the verge of entering the city.

Diwan Singh, an environmentalist, said the other reason for the city‚Äôs inundation in 1978 was unprecedented rainfall in Delhi and Yamuna‚Äôs catchment areas. ‚ÄúThe city lacked a robust drainage. At present, the city doesn‚Äôt get rainfall of that force. Water in Yamuna majorly is due to downpour in the hills,‚Äù Singh said.

Now, the embankments on both sides of the river are complemented by about 20 shanks (concrete structures) and 10 bunds. Bunds along the length of the Yamuna prevent flooding in Delhi after water from the Hathnikund in Haryana is released.

To make the city more safe, the height of the embankments has been increased since 1978, said an official of the irrigation and flood control department, who has been part of the team supervising flood-control measures during three flood-like situations.

‚ÄúNow, when the Yamuna is in spate, the low-lying colonies, which are actually built on the floodplains, are flooded. The Monastery market also gets submerged or maximum, water enters Ring Road, as it happened in 2010 and 2013, due to backflow of water,‚Äù he said.

Shanks and bunds are located near Wazirabad, Jagatpur, Shahdara, Geeta Colony, Yamuna Bazaar, ITO power house, Salimgarh fort, Madanpur Khadar, Jaitpur, Palla, Mithapur, Molarbund and other places help to check the intensity of water.

‚ÄúThese shanks are located at strategic points where the river changes its course. A repeat of the 1978 flood is unlikely because embankments and shanks guard the city. Now we have better coordination among agencies. We have a regulator at Hathnikund, where water is released in controlled manner,‚Äù the official said.

Ramesh Negi, former Delhi Jal Board CEO, said the improved sewer network reduced the possibility of flooding of city colonies.

‚ÄúAs an emergency measure, excess water is diverted to sewers, which goes to sewage treatment plants (STP). Major drains can be closed to prevent backflow of water,‚Äù said Negi.

Manoj Misra, environment expert and convener of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyaan, said now flooding in Delhi means Yamuna water spreading on its floodplains.

India‚Äôs capital will continue to get flooded every monsoon till there‚Äôs coordinated action between the multiple authorities

In the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, every time it rains, it floods. This year has been no different in spite of a spate of new measures ‚Äî new master plans for drainage and sewerage systems, a new flood control order, frequent directives from the Delhi High Court and several monitoring and coordinating agencies put in place at different levels to monitor and prevent urban flooding.

The entire capital city is prone to frequent flooding due to rain, but the only agency that maps the particularly vulnerable spots is the Delhi Traffic Police. The 2018 Drainage Master Plan for NCT, prepared by a team from Indian Institute of Technology Delhi led by noted hydrologist A.K. Gosain, points out that various other civic agencies responsible for managing storm water drainage are neither mandated by law nor bother to keep a record of the extent of flooding. The Delhi Traffic Police records have 330 areas prone to flooding, including 156 identified for this year so far. They are spread all over the city.

The apathy of the civic bodies, and there are nearly a dozen of them, is so glaring that in spite of constant supervision and reprimands for nearly two decades by the Delhi High Court, it had to step in again this year, seeking immediate ‚Äúemergency efforts‚Äù as the first rains hit in July. It appointed a panel under the CEO of Delhi Jal Board (DJB) for remedial measures and again lamented how multiplicity of authorities and their inability to perform the minimal task of ensuring proper drainage are adding to the citizens‚Äô woes and bringing life to a standstill.

What needs to be done to prevent such flooding is well known. The 2018 Drainage Master Plan reiterates those: (a) correcting faulty drainage infrastructure ‚Äî majority of drains flow in a direction opposite to the natural flow of water, and in many cases big drains merge with smaller ones; (b) adopting low-cost flood preventing measures such as rejuvenation of water bodies, rainwater harvesting and low-impact development options and; (c) delinking of solid waste and sewage drains from storm water drainage to prevent clogging and pollution.

‚ÄúThe same challenges, however, persist,‚Äù a senior Delhi government official lamented. ‚ÄúIt is obviously an implementation issue which is being neglected by almost every civic agency responsible for managing the affairs.‚Äù

Broken drains

Delhi‚Äôs storm water drainage infrastructure is in a dilapidated state, says the IIT Delhi report. The last drainage master plan was prepared in 1976, when the population was 6 million. It has gone up more than three times and stood at 16.7 million in the 2011 Census. It is now estimated to be around 20 million.

Delhi has 426.5 km of natural drainage lines and 3,311.5 km of engineered storm water drains. These are under the aegis of 11 different agencies ‚Äî Department of Irrigation and Flood Control, Public Works Department, South Delhi Municipal Corporation, North Delhi Municipal Corporation, East Delhi Municipal Corporation, New Delhi Municipal Council, Delhi Development Authority, Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation, Delhi Cantonment Board, NTPC Ltd and Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department.

The multiplicity creates a coordination challenge and everybody passes the blame every time roads gets waterlogged, no matter what the Delhi High Court and National Green Tribunal (NGT) say.

Design flaws

To begin with, there are major design flaws with the existing drainage system. A majority of the storm water drains have wrong gradients or slopes ‚Äî which takes the water away from its natural downstream flow ‚Äî in all the three major drainage basins: Trans Yamuna, Barapullah and Najafgarh. As a result, the collected runoff has to be pumped back into the Yamuna or drains joining it every time it rains. A failure of these pumps is an annual occurence and so is waterlogging. Another design flaw is that larger drains flow into smaller ones, which causes congestion in the system.

Rapid unplanned urbanisation, increase in paved surfaces preventing water percolation, dumping of construction debris and garbage in drains, covering of drains by building ramps, parking lots and markets that prevent cleaning, and mixing of sewage drains with storm water drains are some of the other major issues. Rapid urbanisation and encroachments have claimed 18 major drains of Delhi between 1976, when the last drainage master plan was made, and now. In 2014-15, the NGT had asked the Irrigation and Flood Control Department (I&FC) of Delhi to trace 201 major drains listed in the 1976 master plan. As of now, it has found only 183.

Three drainage basins

The three drainage basins have different defining features. The Trans Yamuna basin has shallow groundwater level and low elevation, which makes it prone to flooding. The region is protected from river flooding by two marginal bunds (embankments) but ironically these very bunds prevent any rainwater runoff into the river.

The Barapullah basin also has shallow groundwater level and low to medium elevation. The region is protected by a check dam in Mehrauli to prevent surface runoff from Haryana. The Najafgarh basin, the largest of the three, has major drains such as Najafgarh and Mungeshpur that carry considerable storm water from outside Delhi. In all these basins, mobile pumps are used to pump out surplus water into nearby drains when needed, causing congestion in the drains and flooding downstream areas.

Though the 2018 master plan is a good first step, a solution is far away. IIT Delhi, which prepared it, says it has only ‚Äúquantified for every drain as to what is the surplus runoff that needs to be handled using various mechanisms‚Äù and that it has ‚Äúdeliberately not provided the complete implementation strategy‚Äù. That is the job of the civic bodies.

Shiv Kumar, chief executive engineer of the I&FC, which has been appointed the coordinating authority to implement the master plan, says the next task is for Geospatial Delhi Ltd (GSDL), a Delhi government undertaking, to explore the flooding points, after which the civic bodies will validate the IIT Delhi‚Äôs models with ground observations. After this is done, an implementation strategy will be worked out.

That‚Äôs the theory. In practice, after IIT Delhi submitted its draft master plan in 2016 and asked for such validation before finalising its report of 2018, only two of the 11 civic agencies have responded so far ‚Äî North Delhi Municipal Corporation and I&FC.

Disappearing water bodies

The Drainage Master Plan of 2018 shows that water bodies can play a major role in reducing flooding. The plan‚Äôs simulated modelling for all three major drainage basins show that if, after correcting the faulty drainage design, excess runoff water is routed into nearby water bodies (in 100-150 metre range) flooding can be significantly controlled.

‚ÄúOur calculations have shown that flooding of the Trans Yamuna basin can be reduced by about 90% if we utilise water bodies in the area after correcting the invert levels of drains,‚Äù Satish Kumar, IIT Delhi scholar and a member of Gosain‚Äôs team who handled the task of data crunching and modelling for the drainage master plan, told indiaclimatedialogue.net. ‚ÄúIf we add public parks to water bodies for accommodating excess water, then we can achieve the same result (90% reduction in flooding) for the Barapullah and Najafgarh basins too.‚Äù

While the water bodies are important in Delhi‚Äôs scheme of things, the large number of civic bodies responsible for their upkeep ‚Äî Department of Revenue, I&FC, DDA, Department of Archaeological Survey, Department of Forest, CPWD, PWD, the municipal corporations and IIT ‚Äî have shown little interest. A 2016 report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water Resources made some shocking revelations. Of the 971 identified water bodies of Delhi, 346 are dry, 321 are wet, while 215 are fully encroached upon and 89 have been converted into parks.

Pathetic state

Describing it as a ‚Äúpathetic state‚Äù, the parliamentary panel observed that ‚Äúlack of enforcement of the existing laws and poor maintenance of land records in both the rural and urban areas have resulted in rampant encroachment.‚Äù A similar concern had been expressed by the NGT in the same year (2016), following which a high-level committee under Delhi‚Äôs Public Works Department minister Satyendra Jain was formed. But today, the nodal agency for water bodies, the Delhi Parks and Gardens Society of the Delhi government, has no record to show what work has been done for the upkeep or how many water bodies have been revived or preserved.

Earlier, the Delhi High Court had ordered a physical verification of water bodies in response to a public interest litigation filed by Tapas, a non-government agency. The verification process began in 2005 but remains inconclusive, with no clear idea about when will it end.

Arvind Sah, the Court Commissioner appointed to oversee the exercise, declines to say how many surviving water bodies have been found, on the ground that the counting exercise should be completed first. But, ‚ÄúAlmost all water bodies, except those in southwest Delhi and other less inhabited areas, have been reduced to dumping ground of sewerage, construction debris or encroached,‚Äù Sah told indiaclimatedialogue.net.

Lack of application

Sah flags off lack of sensitivity, training or application of mind by the officials of various civic bodies as big challenges to the survival of Delhi‚Äôs water bodies. This is best reflected in the restoration work of the Old Fort Lake in New Delhi, less than 500 metres from the Delhi High Court.

The Old Fort Lake was a popular destination for boating. The National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC), a central government undertaking, was given the task of restoration after it went dry a couple of years ago. The NBCC has already concretized the embankments and paving them with stones.

A part of the bed has been covered with perforated geo-textile sheet to prevent percolation. This display of gross insensitivity to the historical context of the lake and ignorance of environmental friendly alternatives has so angered the environmentalists that some of them are seeking legal remedies.

Though no comprehensive picture is available, it is known that the state of some of the water bodies is a cause of serious concern. The Bhalswa Lake is now filled with sewage water. The Jahangirpuri marshes have been encroached upon. The Najafgarh Lake, which can be a good source of water for domestic consumption, has turned into a sewage dump. In response to the NGT‚Äôs directive, Delhi and Haryana governments agreed in 2017 to revive the Najafgarh Lake but there is no sign of any action yet.

Manu Bhatnagar, principal director of natural heritage division of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), told indiaclimatedialogue.net that the trend towards extinguishing water bodies got accelerated with the economic liberalisation of 1991 when GDP growth became the sole benchmark of economic development and water bodies acquired real estate value. Moreover, as tube wells and toilets came into their lives, villagers had less stakes in the survival of water bodies around them.

There are, however, a few positive cases of revival and preservation. The Hauz Khas Lake has been revived with INTACH‚Äôs efforts and has become a habitat for migratory birds and a popular destination for reidents from all over Delhi. The Sanjay Lake, an artificial water body developed by DDA, is well preserved and so is the Naini Lake in North Delhi. The threat, however, far outweighs such gains.

Inadequate sewage infrastructure

‚ÄúPresently, approximately 50% of Delhi is not connected with sewerage system‚Ä¶,‚Äù says the Sewerage Master Plan for Delhi 2031, released in 2014. That means the sewage generated by 50% of the population, including those from unauthorised colonies, flows into storm water drains.

A top official of Delhi government, who wished to remain unnamed, said almost all drains in the capital, except for some falling under the jurisdiction of NDMC, carry sewage and storm water together, a fact also confirmed by a member of the IIT Delhi team, which prepared the drainage master plan.

Sewage, along with garbage dumped on the roadside drains, leads to silting and blockages in the drains, which requires annual cleaning but this is seldom done in time or properly. The DJB, which is in charge of sewage disposal, punctures sewer lines and drains sewage into storm water drains ‚Äî a practice the IIT Delhi forbids in its recommendations. In case of congestion, it advises DJB to using latest mechanisms such as super suckers for de-clogging the sewer lines.

According to the Sewage Master Plan, Delhi generates 680 million gallons per day (MGD) of sewage, 50% of which is untreated and discharged into the Yamuna. It has 34 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with an installed capacity of 594.7 MGD but with utilisation of 57%, which brings down the actual capacity to treat to only 339 MGD. This data is from 2011. A 2015 report of the Central Pollution Control Board said that 60% of the sewage generated in Delhi was untreated and discharged into the Yamuna.

Given the enormity of the challenges, the Sewage Master Plan proposed an Interceptor Sewer system as a short term relief measure to trap the sewage, which is being tried at present.

#UPDATE Due to closure of Yamuna bridge, 27 passenger trains have been cancelled and 7 trains diverted. https://t.co/4z9EnccX1C ‚Äî ANI (@ANI) July 30, 2018

The city government set up a flood control room and a round-the-clock emergency operation centre to monitor the river situation, they said.

An order banning movement of traffic on the bridge was issued by the disaster management authorities after the flow in the Yamuna showed a rising trend. The river was flowing at 205.5 metres on Sunday evening with the danger mark being 204.83 metres, the officials said.

Old Yamuna Bridge, colloquially known as 'Lohe Ka Pul', is a road-cum-rail bridge on the Delhi-Howrah line that was built over 150 years ago. It serves as a major connectivity link between Delhi and the neighbouring states.

""There is impending danger of floods due to this unprecedented rise in water level resulting in inundation of low-lying areas in the Yamuna bed and may also lead to loss of life and property,"" the order issued by the District Disaster Management Authority said.

""The traffic movement on the bridge is, hereby directed to be closed with immediate effect,"" it said.

Earlier in the day, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia took stock of the ongoing evacuation operation in the low-lying areas of the city, including Akshardham and Pandav Nagar, and appealed to the people to move to safer areas.

Many people have moved to safer places, an official said.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had held an emergency meeting with top officials to evaluate the situation.

""The government has established a flood control room in the office of the district magistrate, District (East) at LM Bund, Geeta Colony. A 24x7 emergency operation centre has also been set up for monitoring the flood situation,"" a senior official said.

People can call at these numbers ‚Äî 011-22428773, 011-22051234 and 011-22501668 ‚Äî for any flood-related help and assistance, he said. General public can also call on a toll-free 24x7 disaster helpline ‚Äî 1077 ‚Äî made operational from the office of the divisional commissioner, Delhi.

Manohar Lal Khattar takes stock of situation

Meanwhile, in Haryana, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar held an emergency meeting with senior officials on Sunday, and directed them to stay alert to deal with any untoward situation. He also conducted an aerial survey of the Hathnikund barrage located on Yamuna river in Yamunanagar district.

The minister was told that 6,05,949 cusecs of water flowing from the Hathnikund barrage was passing through Karnal and would reach Delhi by Monday.

With Yamuna flowing close to the danger mark, several villages were flooded leading to crop losses, officials said. In some villages in Yamunanagar district, the flood waters entered houses and buildings.

The administration has deployed boats at various places for people to commute from one village to other and to evacuate them, if the water level rises further, they said.

Khattar sought information on the water level from the deputy commissioners of Yamunanagar, Karnal, Panipat, Sonipat and Palwal, and other officers through video-conferencing. He also reviewed the arrangements made by them, an official spokesperson said in Chandigarh.

The officers informed the chief minister that 6,05,949 cusecs of water was flowing from the Hathnikund Barrage in Yamunanagar till 6 pm Saturday. Earlier in 2010, 8.05 lakh cusecs of water passed through this barrage, and in 2013, 7.5 lakh cusecs had passed, they said.

The Yamuna water level at the Hathini Kund barrage had crossed the danger mark of 90,000 cusec, according to an official.

""Canals in Haryana are closed when the water level crosses 70,000 cusecs at Hathnikund Barrage, and the water is passing through 18 doors,"" the spokesperson said.

The Karnal deputy commissioner informed the chief minister that about six lakh cusecs of water was passing from Hathnikund barrage on Saturday evening, and its effect could be seen later during the day. The officers said the water level was gradually decreasing.

A sub-divisional officer and three junior engineers have been deputed at every 20 kilometers in Karnal. Heavy earth moving machines and 20,000 sand bags have been kept ready to deal with any untoward situation. Arrangements have also been made for evacuating people to safer places as the situation demands, the officers added.

Medical teams have been arranged and officers of the animal husbandry department have been alerted to deal with the flood-like situation, the officers said.

The officers of Panipat district said Yamuna river passed through 14 villages of the district, adding that Army has visited and checked the areas adjoining the river.

The Sonipat district administration informed Khattar that the water of Yamuna was flowing one kilometer away from Asadpur village where officers of the irrigation department have been deputed.

The administration has also issued a warning to people living in the areas surrounding Yamuna river. A team of State Disaster Management force has already been put on alert, and a flood control room has been set up at the district level for fast response to deal with any flood-like situation, the officials said.

The chief minister directed the officers that the administration in the vulnerable districts should remain ready to deal with diseases which may break out after the water level of Yamuna recedes.

The officers should ensure that fogging is done in the affected areas from time to time, he added.

After holding a meeting with officials here, Khattar said 'special girdawari' (revenue survey) would be conducted to assess the damage to the crops caused by floods and rains.

He added that due compensation would be given to the affected farmers.

Besides the judges, the the Registry of the High Court would also contribute to the Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF), Kerala.

In August, most of its solar panels were reportedly damag ed in floods that shut the airport for two weeks.

The flooding was not surprising since the airport, opened in 1999, was built after diverting a tributary of the Periyar river as shown in the map below.

In the past, bad planning and design have led to the shut down of major airports, including Mumbai , Chennai and Delhi . Yet, not much has been learned from such disasters: a new airport is being built by diverting the Ulwe river near Panvel Creek in Navi Mumbai.

Here are some of India‚Äôs other airports that are vulnerable to disaster because they have been planned and designed in flagrant disregard of environmental common sense.

Mumbai

Both the Mumbai airport‚Äôs runways obstruct the flow of the Mithi river. The first runway, along with the taxiway, extends over a culvert on the river while the second encroaches upon the river itself. When the river flooded in 2005, the airport had to be closed.

Chennai

In 2011, the Chennai airport‚Äôs second runway covered a culvert on the Adyar river. In December 2015, when heavy rainfall led to water from the Chembarambakkam lake being released into the Adyar, the airport was one of the first major installations to be completely flooded.

Jaipur

Jaipur‚Äôs second runway was completed in 2016. Like in Chennai and Mumbai, the runway was extended on a water channel connecting a series of tanks in the city.

Tirupati

The airport in Renigunta is built between a series of tanks. As these maps show, it encroaches on lake beds, which are also threatened by much built-up growth and plotted development.

Visakhapatnam

The entire roof of the Visakhapatnam airport was damaged in the 2014 Hudhud cyclone. India‚Äôs eastern coast is prone to strong cyclonic winds. Why was the roof not designed to withstand them?

Navi Mumbai

Not learning from disasters recent and past, the Rs 16,000 crore Navi Mumbai International Airport is being built by filling and diverting the Ulwe river flowing into the Panvel creek. The landfilling is already causing flooding in nearby villages.

New Delhi

The airport‚Äôs swanky new terminal, T3, was built on one of the lowest points of the chosen site. The graph below represents the cross section along the red line marking the location of Terminal 3. It shows that when it rains, water from surrounding higher grounds flows to this point, the reason for the airport‚Äôs flooding in 2011 and 2013.

In August alone, the state government‚Äôs Integrated Disease Surveillance Project recorded 171 cases of leptospirosis with four deaths, against 46 cases with six deaths last August. Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease transmitted mainly through water or soil contaminated by the urine of infected animals.

Similarly, the state saw 1,617 cases of chicken pox with one death in August, against zero cases in all of 2017. Also, while viral Hepatitis A infected 1,044 and killed four this August, there were only 988 cases in all of 2017.

From January to 1 September 2018, Kerala saw 788 cases of leptospirosis with 36 deaths, 21,915 chicken pox cases with 15 deaths, and 141 cases of scrub typhus with two deaths. During the same period last year, there were 1,408 leptospirosis cases with 80 deaths, and 340 scrub typhus cases with five deaths.

‚ÄúWe are currently distributing Doxycycline tablets in flood-hit areas to prevent leptospirosis and have created separate wards for chicken pox cases,"" health minister K.K. Shailaja told Mint.

Kerala has 18 general hospitals, 16 district hospitals, 231 community health centres (CHCs) and 682 primary health centres (PHCs). According to the state‚Äôs health and family welfare department, at least 481 PHCs, 137 CHCs and 19 dispensaries were badly damaged in the floods, after which the state sought help from the Union health ministry. The healthcare system needs to gear up quickly as lakhs of people in relief camps return homes and seek medical services.

‚ÄúThe damage caused by the flood is immeasurable. It is a huge task to rebuild everything. The health department also suffered great loss. More than 10 hospitals and many sub centres were destroyed completely. Many hospitals suffered partial loss. Many hospital equipment were destroyed,"" said Shailaja.

‚ÄúThe government, along with the support of the people, is preparing projects to rebuild all this. Many people, organizations and institutions have promised help and if all this materializes in a proper way, the problem can be solved easily. We have decided to open 200 temporary hospitals to tackle health issues,"" she said.

The state government is taking help from the private sector and also sought help from other states. Teams of expert doctors have arrived from several states including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh with essential drugs. The central government, too, has sent an expert team and provided materials for environmental sanitation.

‚ÄúFunctioning of various government and private hospitals was badly affected by the heavy rains and flooding. Many of them have started functioning and within two weeks, all of them will be working in full swing,"" said Shailaja. ‚ÄúAvailability of medicines, adequate service of doctors and nurses, chlorination of wells and other water sources, shifting of people with communicable diseases to separate wards, etc., are being taken care of.""

The National Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC) has already warned about vector-borne diseases. ‚ÄúThe recent floods may indirectly lead to an increase in vector-borne diseases through the expansion in the number and range of vector breeding habitats. Standing water caused by heavy rainfall or overflow of rivers can act as breeding sites for mosquitoes, and therefore enhance the potential for the breeding of vectors of dengue, chikungunya, malaria, Japanese encephalitis, etc. Flooding may initially flush out mosquito breeding, but it comes back when the waters recede,"" a senior NCDC official told Mint.

delhi,2018,https://citizenmatters.in/city-news-delhi-parking-urban-flooding-mohua-bagree-market-kolkata-hyderabad-craf-8189,20-Mar-20,City Buzz: Plans to combat urban floods | Bagree market fire | Parking charge in Delhi‚Ä¶and more,"Urban floods: Will urban affairs ministry take charge?

Given the spate of flooding incidents in Indian cities and towns in the recent past, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) is reportedly planning to involve the National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) to spell out ways in which the ministry can act to prevent and mitigate the impacts of urban floods.

In 2010 an expert panel of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) had issued guidelines on management of urban flooding, and had recommended the establishment of an urban flooding unit under the ministry of urban affairs, headed by an officer at the level of joint secretary. In July 2012, the Ministry of Home Affairs had identified the urban affairs ministry as the nodal ministry for urban flooding, but there was no operational action on the front. The present move is being seen as delayed but much-needed action to implement the guidelines issued by the NDMA.

Delhi to impose one-time parking charge

In a move to combat the growing issue of lack of parking spaces within the city, the South Delhi municipal corporation has introduced a one-time parking charge for vehicles, to be paid at the time of purchase. The civic body has deemed the charge necessary to raise funds to improve parking infrastructure in the city. The North and East Delhi municipal corporations are expected to follow suit in order to keep prices of vehicles uniform across the city. The move awaits approval by the office of the Lieutenant Governor and the Delhi government.

If approved, the move will raise the cost for buyers by Rs 2000 to Rs 6000 for cars below Rs 4 lakh, Rs 4000 to Rs 10,000 for cars costing up to Rs 8 lakh, Rs 4000 to Rs 15,000 for cars costing up to 12 lakh and Rs 4000 to Rs 75000 for luxury cars priced at Rs 40 lakh. Auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws, taxis and two-wheelers which were thus far exempt will have to pay Rs 5000 towards the one-time parking charge. This is the first such increase in charges levied in 10 years.

BMC finalises new hoarding policy for Mumbai

The Mumbai civic body has finalised a new hoarding policy that may see a rise in digital hoardings, allowed for the first time in parts of the city. The final draft is to be submitted for approval this week. The policy focuses on uniformity of rates, as it removed the earlier rules on different sizes and costs applicable in various zones. The policy has been drafted after receiving suggestions and inputs from the public earlier this year.

The civic body took into consideration around 218 suggestions and inputs received from the public to formulate the policy. The need for a new policy arose in the wake of directives by the state government and High Court on the same, after the expiration of the old policy in January this year. According to the new policy, there is no clampdown on political billboards and banners which will continue to flourish across the city.

The policy also suggests a priority window for clearance of digital billboards. There are special incentives for the use of solar panels to illuminate digital billboards and those with CCTV that provides a live feed to the local body. Civic messages must also be displayed on the hoardings for a period of 30 days as opposed to 15 days in the old policy.

Fire guts Kolkata‚Äôs Bagree Market; losses close to a hundred crores

A blaze at the commercial wholesale hub of Kolkata, Bagree Market, raged on for two days before it could be finally brought under control. The fire spread rapidly through the multi-storey building which is home to over 1000 shops, located in a congested part of Central Kolkata. There were no reports of casualties but material losses at an early stage were estimated to be over Rs 80 crores.

30 fire tenders were rushed to the spot on reports of a blaze in the early morning of September 16th. As a majority of the shops were shut, there were few instances of death or injuries. Citizens however are unhappy with the civic body which granted a renewal of license to the complex on July 31st, without a valid fire clearance certificate. The firefighters‚Äô attempt to curb the blaze proved futile due to narrow, inaccessible corridors and flammable material present throughout the market. Notably, this is the seventh instance of a fire in the area in the last ten years.

Hyderabad gets first Rapid Action Force

In a first among major cities, Hyderabad unveiled its City Rapid Action Force (CRAF) to be called upon in dire situations to control riots or other emergencies. The CRAF will be under the command of the city‚Äôs police commissioner and can be deployed without the need for elaborate procedures as in the case of CRPF or RAF. The CRAF is a specialised police force for the city.

The members of the CRAF have been trained by the RAF and will be engaged in diffusing riots and communal tension and aiding in rescue and relief work. The current strength of the CRAF will be 40 members, including 20 women. The motto of the force was ‚ÄòServing Humanity with Sensitive Policing‚Äô. The city authorities were of the view that such an initiative is crucial and necessary in all major cities to reduce response time to any fire situation on the ground.

In hindsight, water experts are saying that the intensity of Kerala floods could have been reduced if the water from 35 big dams in Kerala was released much earlier. Kerala blamed neighbouring Tamil Nadu for the floods in the Supreme Court on Friday, saying the gates of Mullaperiyar dam were suddenly opened without any warning, a claim denied by Tamil Nadu government.

What has happened in Kerala poses a bigger question regarding flood management in India considering that around 15% of India‚Äôs land mass is prone to floods, with an average of 1,548 people losing their lives and around eight million hectares getting affected, causing loss of about ‚Çπ5,628 crore every year. The 5,254 dams in India are an integral part of flood management, apart from storing water for irrigation and generating power.

The 2017 CAG report submitted in Parliament presented an insight on what is wrong with India‚Äôs flood management plan. Of the 219 proposed new telemetry stations, used to forecast floods, only a quarter were set-up till August 2016. Of the 375 existing stations, almost 60% were non-functional after installation, the report said.

‚ÄúFlood forecasting data was used in the formulation of flood forecast only after comparing the telemetry data with manually observed data; and in the case of mismatch between the two sets of data, manual data was adopted,‚Äù the CAG report said, pulling up CWC for not depending on telemetry data even after investing in modernisation for nearly 20 years.

The report also said that there is an emergency action plan for only 7% of the dams in India. For the 61 in Kerala, there is none. In eight out of 17 flood-prone states, the integrated flood management plans for entire river/basin have not been taken up, the report said.

The auditor also said that frequent check of dams before and after monsoon happened in only two -- Bihar and Odisha -- of the 17 two states in recent years.

Madhavan Nair Rajeevan, secretary in the ministry of earth sciences, admitted earlier this week that there was poor flood management system in India.

‚ÄúAs per my understanding, no big reservoir has a decision support system. So we don‚Äôt know when to open gates and how to open them‚Ä¶There is a common perception that in India most of the flood management systems are not supported by science. I am very sure we don‚Äôt have a decision support system and we need it,‚Äù he had said.

AK Gosain, professor emeritus at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, agreed with him and said dam management in India works on the principle that at end of the monsoon the reservoirs should be full. ‚ÄúThe tendency is not to release water till the last go and this is what has happened in Kerala,‚Äù he said.

Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People said the reason for this tendency was that most of the big dams in India are run by the power generation companies, who are unwilling to reduce water level beyond a limit as it can impact power generation. In Kerala, the water level in the big dams is monitored by Kerala State Electricity Board.

Experts say the flooding in downstream areas can be better managed if the India Meteorological Department‚Äôs 72-hour forecast is used to create simulation models for water release. Gujarat and Odisha governments use the IMD‚Äôs forecast to release water slowing from the dams on Tapi and Mahanadi rivers respectively, helping the two states manage floods. Despite Gujarat receiving substantial rainfall in 2017, Surat city on the Tapi river was not flooded

In a true example of communal harmony, a temple hall at Eravathur near Mala, on the southern part of Thrissur district turned into an Eid prayer hall on Wednesday as the nearby mosque at Kochukadavu remained submerged in flood waters.

The temple hall was was serving as the relief camp for the people of Kochukavdu and nearby Kuzhur ‚Äî two worst hit areas due to floods in the district.

As the Muslims were searching for a place to conduct the Eid prayers on Wednesday, the SNDP Yogam, which runs the Purappullikkavu Ratneswari temple, happily offered the hall for them.

The temple trust also arranged all facilities for the Muslims, including water for the devotees to clean themselves before prayers. Around 200 Muslim devotees participated in the prayers.

Mosque shelters Hindu families

PTI adds:

In Malappuram district, a mosque has provided shelter and food to several Hindu families displaced by the massive floods, while groups of Muslim men have assisted in cleaning two Hindu shrines affected by the deluge.

The Juma Masjid, located at Akampadam in Chaliyar village in northern Malappuram, was sheltering 17 displaced Hindu families, including women, children and the elderly were given space to sleep inside the mosque.

When the families returned two days ago, the mosque provided them rice, pulses and other essential materials alongwith food prepared in its canteen.

A Vishnu temple at Venniyode in Wayanad and a shrine dedicated to Lord Ayyappa at Mannarkkad in Malappuram, inundated due to the floods, were cleaned by a group of Muslim men.

Carrying huge amounts of silt and rocks, it destroyed lives, houses and everything else that came its way. Five years later, film maker Abhishek Kapoor is out with a film that tells the story of the devastating flood that left Uttarakhand in shreds. Kedarnath, starring actors Sushant Singh Rajput and Sara Ali Khan, is a romantic drama set in the backdrop of the 2013 floods. The story revolves around a wealthy Hindu girl who is on pilgrimage at the Kedarnath temple, considered to be one of the sites at the Chhota char dham Hindu pilgrimage in the northern Himalayas, and a Muslim guide.

The film has been mired in controversy over the projection of an inter-faith love story. As it readies to hit the silver screen on December 7, here is a look back at the episode that shook the hilly state, leaving thousands dead and several others missing.

What exactly had happened?

Between June 13 and 17, the state of Uttarakhand had received an unusual amount of rainfall. This led to the melting of the Chorabari glacier and the eruption of the Mandakini river. The floods affected large parts of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Western Nepal. The heavy rainfall caused massive flash floods and landslides resulting in the death of residents and tourists as well as extensive damage to property. Reportedly the worst hit was the Kedarnath valley popular for the 8th century temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. The flood left behind a death toll of more than 5000. Ecologist Chandra Prakash Kala notes in a report that ‚Äúthe approximate cost of damaged bridges and roads was $285 million, dam projects worth $ 30 million and loss to state tourism worth $195 million.‚Äù

The upper Himalayan regions of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are difficult to access due to the difficult snow-clad terrain. But a good number of pilgrims make the trip every year thanks to its religious sites. Uttarakhand, in fact, has four Hindu temples ‚Äî Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, Yamunotri ‚Äî and one Sikh shrine ‚Äî Hemkund Sahib ‚Äî that bring in thoudands of pilgrims every year.

Kala notes that in 2011 approximately 25 million tourists had visited the area despite the fact that the region is highly susceptible to natural disasters like earthquakes, landslides and flash floods. Historical records shows the area had been affected by similar natural disasters back in 1893, 1968 and in 1970 when the calamitous impact of the flood had resulted in the Chipko movement.

What was the cause of the flood?

Despite the fact that heavy rainfall and cloudbursts are natural causes for the floods and landslides, environmentalists believe that the disaster of 2013 was a manmade one. ‚ÄúUnplanned and haphazard construction, mismanaged tourism and related activities including intensive mining in this fragile ecosystem are some of the reasons that made to name this natural disaster partly as man-made that increased the intensity and magnitude of damages,‚Äù writes Kala. Over the years the number of pilgrims visiting the area had also exponentially increased. In order to meet with the rising demands of religious tourism, the state government built an intricate network of roads, hotels, lodges and carried out other construction activities into the remote mountainous regions of the Himalayas. However, it is also true that the unexpected timing of the rainfall and the unusual amount of it also did not leave enough time for the pilgrims to evacuate, thereby increasing the magnitude of the impact.

How was the relief work carried out?

The relief work was carried out by a combined team of army, airforce, navy, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Border Security Force, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Public Works Department as well as by local administration. Within five days, the army had deployed about 10,000 soldiers and the airforce had brought in more than 45 pieces of aircraft to carry out the rescue operation. The ITBP which guards the Indo-China border swung into action even before the army or the air force could reach the spot. They apparently managed to rescue more than 33,000 people from remote, inaccessible mountain zones. It is worth noting that after the disaster, the rescue operation in the region in itself has become a risky affair due to the unpredictable weather conditions, mountainous topography and lack of accessibility in majority of the routes.

In the aftermath of the disaster, the fear among pilgrims resulted in a severe blow to tourism, which is a major source of income for most of the local inhabitants of the place. The Nanda Devi Raj Jaat which is a most important festival in Uttarakhand that takes place every 12 years was scheduled to take place on August 29, 2013. However, the state government was forced to cancel it on account of the damage caused to roads and bridges. After 100 days of deafening silence the pilgrimage route to Kedarnath was finally opened on October 5, but only a small number of pilgrims were allowed at a time. However, religious tourism continued to remain affected for the next couple of years. It is worth noting though that despite the damage caused and the fear instilled by the floods, faith of the pilgrims was restored when they realised that though most parts of Kedarnath town had undergone a catastrophe, what remained untouched was the Shiva temple built in the 8th century AD.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

(ANINDYA CHATTOPADHYAY/ TOI, BCCL Delhi)

The southwest monsoon, hands down, is the best-known weather system in India. However, there is another rain and snow-bearing system that is extremely important to northern India, but is relatively less observed and studied. We‚Äôre talking of western disturbances.

Western disturbances are a weather phenomenon whose arrival is associated with snow and rain in the Himalayas and parts of northwest India. They help sustain Himalayan glaciers and the local ecology and provide nourishment to winter crops. And although they lack the powerful ‚Äòpunch‚Äô of the southwest monsoon, western disturbances also cause the occasional weather disruption, especially in the hilly regions of north India that are prone to landslides and flash floods.

For example, did you know that the June 2013 Uttarakhand floods‚Äîthat devastated the pilgrim town of Kedarnath and killed over 5700 people across the state‚Äîare thought to have been caused by anomalous western disturbances? Experts also believe western disturbances were behind the Jammu & Kashmir deluge of September 2014 and the Leh cloudburst of August 2010.

With that, let‚Äôs dive straight into this little-understood weather phenomenon, how it occurs and why it is important to India.

What exactly are western disturbances?

First, a basic meteorological fact: worldwide, low-pressure systems are associated with precipitation. This is because warm, rising air in these systems condenses at higher altitudes to form precipitation, such as rain or snow.

A western disturbance (WD) also begins as a low-pressure system; one that originates in the mid-latitude region near the Atlantic Ocean and Europe. ‚ÄúThe low-pressure system typically forms over the Mediterranean Sea. It then hitches a ride eastwards on high-altitude westerly jet streams‚Äîmassive ribbons of fast winds traversing the earth from west to east‚Äîpicking up moisture from various sources including the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea and sometimes even the Arabian Sea,‚Äù explains Vineet Kumar, a contributor with the Indian meteorology blog, Vagaries of the Weather.

After covering thousands of miles, these moisture-laden WDs eventually come up against the mighty Himalayas and are blocked. As a consequence, the moisture gets trapped and precipitation is shed in the form of snow and rain over northwest India, and sometimes other parts of north India. That, in a nutshell, describes the influence of WDs on India.

Who named them western disturbances and why?

The word ‚Äòdisturbance‚Äô is used because the air within low pressure systems (fronts, depressions and cyclones) tends to be unstable or disturbed. And ‚Äòwestern‚Äô refers to the direction from which they originate vis-√†-vis India.

A view of snow-covered tourist town Gulmarg after Kashmir's first snowfall in November 2018 (BILAL BAHADUR/ BCCL Delhi)

According to the book Western Disturbances - An Indian Meteorological Perspective (A.P. Dimri and Amulya Chevuturi, Springer, 2016), the phrase ‚Äòwestern disturbance‚Äô was first used in published literature in 1947 by a scientist, SL Malurkar. However, its precursor, ‚Äòwinter disturbance‚Äô was earlier coined in 1931 by another scientist, Venkiteshwaran SP, who studied the system at Agra.

How do WDs originate?

The atmospheric process that triggers the birth of WDs is a complex one. But in simple terms, WDs are caused by pronounced temperature differences between higher and lower latitudes. The transfer and interaction of warm and cold air creates an area of low pressure in the mid-latitudes, usually over the Mediterranean Sea.

Provided other conditions remain favourable, chances of WD intensification are higher when there is greater meridional (north versus south) temperature difference. Akshay Deoras, an independent weather forecaster and PhD student at the Department of Meteorology, University of Reading, UK, says, ‚ÄúA higher temperature gradient is associated with a more intense western disturbance.‚Äù

Deoras adds that other factors that determine the strength of WDs are the location and intensity of the jet stream and the amount of moisture being carried by the low-pressure system.

Advertisement How do they make their presence felt in north India?

As mentioned earlier, western disturbances already carry with them moisture from the distant seas of Europe. In addition, they pick up moisture from the Arabian Sea and sometimes even the Indian Ocean due to a pre-existing sub-surface low over western India, says A. P. Dimri, Professor, School of Environmental Sciences at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

File photo of heavy rainfall in December in Chandigarh (PRITAM THAKUR/ BCCL Chandigarh)

Most of this moisture is shed when the WD reaches the western Himalayas in India‚Äîmainly in Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Uttarakhand‚Äîbetween November and March. ‚ÄúThe influence of WDs is strongest from December to February, when there can be as many as 5-6 WDs every month. After this period, their frequency drops to 1-2 every month,‚Äù Dimri adds.

WDs are also associated with cloudy skies and an increase in night-time temperatures in parts of north India. They can also cause strong winds that help disperse suspended pollutants in the smog-filled cities of the region, including New Delhi.

It is worth mentioning here that although the effects of WDs are rarely seen after spring (March-April), due to the northward movement of the jet stream above India, in some cases (which we will read about ahead), WDs can persist even outside the traditional winter months.

Why are strong WDs important for India?

India is a rain-dependent country. And while the southwest monsoon covers most of India, some parts of north India don‚Äôt get much rain from it. Instead, these regions depend on snow and rain from western disturbances during the Indian winter season from November to March.

Precipitation from western disturbances replenishes the Himalayan glaciers, preserves the natural ecosystem, helps crops like wheat, and assists hydropower generation. Occasionally, however, strong WDs can also push further east into parts of the Indo-Gangetic plains.

Leon Brown, Head of Global Meteorological Operations at IBM Watson Media and Weather estimates that India gets an estimated 5-10% of its total annual rainfall from WDs. That may not sound like much, but WDs are actually indispensable to north India. Weak WDs are associated with crop failure and water problems across the region. Conversely, strong WDs can help residents, farmers and governments avoid many of the problems associated with water scarcity.

Do WDs cause extreme weather?

Dimri stresses that WDs are not usually associated with disasters, since they not high-intensity weather systems. ‚ÄúThese are advective, not convective systems, so they don‚Äôt have a lot of energy and usually don‚Äôt cause heavy precipitation,‚Äù he says.

That being said, anomalies do exist. WDs had a role to play in the Leh cloudburst of 2010, Uttarakhand rains of 2013, and the J&K floods of 2014. All of these occurred well after the normal 'exit period' of western disturbances in India. And since these unseasonal, heavy rain events happened in predominantly hilly regions, they resulted in large-scale havoc and loss of life.

A view of the damage caused by landslides at Kedarnath, three months after the devastating Uttarakhand floods (Piyal Bhattacharjee/ TOI, Delhi, BCCL)

Some experts say that disasters like the Kedarnath floods may have occurred due to interactions between western disturbances and the summer monsoon. Others disagree, saying that WDs and monsoons occur in completely different time frames and therefore, chances of interactions are very low. However, everyone agrees that WDs need to be studied in much more detail.

‚ÄúAvailability of data on western disturbances is low. They are not tracked extensively in some of the countries they cross before reaching India. Thus, unlike tropical cyclones or monsoon depressions, there is no official end-to-end tracking of WDs. Besides, advection-based systems like WDs need different tracking mechanisms from convection-based ones, which those countries may not have,‚Äù says Deoras.

The lack of data and understanding of the mechanics of WDs has also led to debates about the impact of global warming and climate change on western disturbance formation and intensity. In an age where droughts, crop failure and melting glaciers are becoming all too common, studying these linkages more closely will allow scientists to get deeper insights into western disturbances, how they may have changed over the years, and most importantly, what we can do about it.",discussion,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India",16-Jun-13,20-Jun-13,Uttarakhand,300 mm,"Rs. 10,000 crore","5,700","Destruction of infrastructure, loss of life",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

New Delhi, India ‚Äì The cost to rebuild Kerala following the severe flooding that hit the southern Indian state will exceed $3.7bn, authorities said.

Almost 500 people were killed and a million left homeless after the worst floods in a century hit the coastal state in May.

The torrential rains destroyed tens of thousands of homes, ruined crops and washed away roads and bridges.

At the state assembly on Thursday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the economic losses would exceed $3.73bn.

Earlier this month, the central government announced it would provide 6bn rupees ($84.6m) in assistance to the state, far less than the 20bn rupees ($282m) it requested.

Much to the dismay of state officials, the government has also rejected offers of foreign aid from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

Around 50,000 people are still living in over 300 camps across the state. More than four million jobs have been impacted by the floods so far, while 3.3 million jobs are currently ‚Äúin jeopardy‚Äù, according to a recent report by financial research firm Care Ratings.

Both the agriculture and tourism sectors have been badly affected.

Tourism badly hit

Kerala‚Äôs backwaters, a pretty network of lakes, rivers and canals stretching almost half the length of the state, draw millions of tourists every year.

Industry members now say there have been more than 80 percent cancellations of tourist bookings over the past few months.

‚ÄúThe GDP growth of the state would decline by at least one percent. Damages and losses still need further assessment. Things should normalise by next year. Tourism could see a revival in the next six months. But everything would be contingent on how swiftly the rebuilding begins,‚Äù Kavita Chacko, the senior economist who authored the Care Ratings report, told Al Jazeera.

Almost a week after the floodwaters receded, authorities have also turned their attention to the health risks posed by stagnant water in flooded neighbourhoods, which can aid the spread of diseases like cholera.

On Thursday, India‚Äôs Central Ministry of Health said cases of leptospirosis, acute diarrhoea and dengue are increasing.

‚ÄúOver 169 medical facilities, including hospitals, have been damaged and are out of bounds,‚Äù said Raju VR, Director of Health Services in Thiruvananthapuram, the state capital.

‚ÄúThis is only a conservative estimate. The damage might be far higher. The healthcare sector has recorded losses over $20m across the state,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄúChildren and pregnant women should be most careful as there is great risk of communicable diseases with people coming back to their homes.‚Äù

A post-flood recovery action plan is now in place, according to Shailaja Teacher, Kerala‚Äôs health minister.

‚ÄúThe most dangerous thing that we need to guard against now is an epidemic,‚Äù she told Al Jazeera.

‚ÄúWe are telling people to drink boiled water only. We have initiated a cleaning mission to sanitise homes and schools and buildings as people return from relief camps.‚Äù",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
delhi,2018,https://thewire.in/environment/in-the-wake-of-kerala-floods-the-jury-is-still-out-on-the-dams-guilt,19-Sep-18,"In the Wake of Kerala Floods, the Jury Is Still out on the Dams' Guilt","The story is as old as dams themselves. While some claim storage dams help regulate flood impact, others stress that dams exacerbate the effects of floods. This has been at the centre of the Kerala dam issue as well. Kerala blamed Tamil Nadu for not opening the Mullaperiyar dam gates on time, saying a sudden water release battered the state. On the other hand, a new Central Water Commission report on the floods has left out the Mullaperiyar dam management issue, saying it was rainfall that was to blame for the floods.

Pro-dam lobbies say that dams meant to produce power should not be looked at as flood regulators. A dam can store water that, depending on when it is released, can make flooding worse. Water released from dams, free of silt, also have very high erosion potential. The question then remains: should structures like dams that engineer nature be regularly examined for their disaster potential?

While this question has not yet been answered, plans are moving not towards answers but towards more projects. Nitin Gadkari, the Union water resources minister, has just re-announced an older project on the Yamuna in Uttarakhand: the Lakhwar hydroelectric dam. The project will have a 204-metre-high wall and a 42-km-long reservoir, effectively stemming the flow of the river for 40 km.

For the next 20-25 years #Delhi will not face a water problem after this project is completed. Also the cities in #Rajasthan and #Haryana, on bank of Yamuna will gain from this project: Union Minister @nitin_gadkari on #Lakhwar dam project pic.twitter.com/5iBBxdrwMR ‚Äî PIB India (@PIB_India) August 28, 2018

Speaking in the last week of August, Gadkari said, ‚ÄúWhen Yamuna doesn‚Äôt have water, then this storage dam will keep water to the river. (sic) This will solve the drinking water crisis. Delhi is our capital and for the next 20-25 years there will be no drinking water problem in Delhi because of this dam. From December to June, the water flow in the river will increase. The big towns in Rajasthan and Haryana will also benefit from this dam and will have more drinking water.‚Äù

While we are still struggling to understand the environmental impact of dams, it is ironic that approvals for the Lakhwar dam actually pre-date the Environmental Impact Notification Act itself.

The first such approval ‚Äì of the administrative variety ‚Äì was granted way back in 1987. As the EIA Act was not around at that time, none of the dam‚Äôs impacts on hydrology, ecology, potential for flooding and erosion were considered. Instead, papers accessed by The Wire belie a completely different set of concerns.

A letter dated February 3, 1987, granting environmental approval asks for the following: a) adequate fuel arrangement for labour force, b) disposal of quarried material and landscaping to be done after digging, c) catchment treatment for people affected by the dam, d) prohibiting of grazing in the forest areas, e) skill training of displaced people, f) no acquisition of additional forest areas for the dam, and g) inclusion of soil and forest experts in state-created monitoring committee.

Clearly, the approval concerns itself with the project site rather than the downstream impacts. Tunnelling had started for the dam ‚Äì abandoned in 1992 ‚Äì but again, the impacts were not quantified. This is something that the environment ministry itself pointed out in a 2011 meeting of the Expert Appraisal Committee. The committee pointed out that the dam‚Äôs proponents hadn‚Äôt yet undertaken a proper environmental impact. Form 1 (which provides the details of impact) was not provided and terms of reference were not set for the environmental impact assessment. It also said the developers had provided ‚Äúpiecemeal information‚Äù. The committee asked the proponents: ‚ÄúIn view of the facts that part construction of Lakhwar dam complex is already done, the environmental impacts have already occurred, how do the developers address this issue?‚Äù

But these questions though have not stopped the states. Last month, six of them signed a memorandum of understanding for building the Lakhwar dam. The old 1987 clearance continues to be held as legitimate approval.

While the dam looks at the Yamuna‚Äôs waters as a source of drinking water, the other question to be asked is: what will happen to environmental flows of the already lean river?

Manoj Misra, a river activist, has asked how the Yamuna is expected to survive a huge dam. ‚ÄúPresently there are barrages cum low dams at Dak Patthar and at Hathnikund, on Yamuna, upstream of Delhi [that suck] the river dry in the lean season.‚Äù This season is almost nine months long. ‚ÄúHigh flows during the monsoon result in the river coming back into its own at least once every monsoon. Then, one can see the Yamuna all along its length in Delhi, Mathura, Agra and downstream. This helps recover the river, though briefly, and helps recharge the ground water, too.

‚ÄúBut once we have the 200+ m high dam at Lakhwar with a monstrous reservoir behind it, then it is kaput for the Yamuna, as then the river would become captive round the year, and even the monsoon-period free-flow would become history. Lakhwar would do to Yamuna what Tehri has done to Ganga. Turn it captive round the year,‚Äù he explained. Misra has approached the National Green Tribunal in effort to stall the project.

While the Yamuna is generally water-starved, unexpected flooding will need to be factored in.

If there is one thing that everyone can agree on after the Kerala floods, it is that dams should have rule-curves and an understanding of how a dam behaves during flooding. Rule curves estimate the water storage in dam reservoirs, especially useful in flood or excess-rain scenarios. At a public talk held in Delhi by the National Institute of Disaster Management on dams in India recently, N.N. Rai, an official of the Central Water Commission, said that rule curves should be made for dams and that this was one of the CWC‚Äôs recommendations. ‚ÄúDams in India don‚Äôt have rule curves. We can‚Äôt carry forward without [them nor] adaptive management that responds to changing scenarios,‚Äù says Himanshu Thakkar, an expert on dams at the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People and the keynote speaker at the event.

As India is faced with natural disasters, and as climate science points to increasing uncertainty in rainfall frequency as well as volume, precaution is certainly called for. The Lakhwar dam needs an environmental impact assessment, rule curves, public consultation and updated hydrological data before it can be considered. Old solutions to old problems require, at the very least, a new, more scientific outlook.

Delhi's air quality remained ""severe"" for the third day due to dust storms in Rajasthan, prompting authorities to issue warning to people to avoid staying outdoors for long and suspend construction activities, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

In the northeast torrential rain for the past three days has wreaked havoc in the region, with floods leaving thousands homeless in Tripura, Manipur, Mizoram and Assam.

Two people were swept away by strong river currents in Tripura yesterday, while over 14,000 lost their homes as heavy downpour submerged parts of the state, officials said.

Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb, who visited the flood-hit areas, has briefed Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh about the ""critical situation"" in the state.

In neighbouring Manipur, the state government has declared ""holiday"" till Friday at all educational and government establishments in Imphal and its adjoining districts in view of the flood situation.

Two people drowned in swollen rivers in separate incidents yesterday, according to police.

The water level in major rivers of Manipur receded this morning, but the situation continues to remain ""vulnerable"", officials said.

Fifteen relief camps have been set up across the state to help those affected by flood.

The situation in Assam has worsened with three people losing their lives and nearly 1.7 lakh people affected across seven districts.

Landslides triggered by heavy downpour disrupted train services in Assam. Though no casualty has been reported, the extent of damage is yet to be ascertained, a North East Frontier Railway official said.

Heavy rain continued to lash parts of Mizoram, cutting off Lunglei, Lawngtlai and Siaha districts in southern parts of the state from the rest of the country.

The Mizoram-National Highway 54 and another road via Thenzawl were closed after landslides last night.

The flood-affected states have engaged disaster management teams to evacuate and relocate people to safer areas and relief camps.

The western parts of India, too, experienced dust storms leading to cancellation of flights from the Chandigarh International airport due to low visibility and the Haryana government issuing a advisory to stop construction activities.

Severe heat conditions have prevailed in most parts of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan over the last few days.

The Taj Mahal sparkled white in the distance, cleansed by the rain. Curious citizens swarmed to take pictures. Until the day before, the Yamuna riverbed was barren as a desert, with streaks of fetid black rivulets of sewage. People walked freely - to bathe, pray, wash clothes or to take their cattle for a dip-sidestepping greasy rotting things underfoot and covering their nose to fend off the foul smell.

That buzz of excitement has fizzled out. The river has been rising, touching the danger mark in five days. The water level behind the Taj has swelled, entering the compound and swamping its lush gardens. ""The river is angry,"" says Pahelwan Singh, 52, who sells flowers at the Mankameshwar temple, roughly 3 km from the Taj. A couple of years ago, beautiful boats plied upon it, he recalls. Every Sunday, people came to take a holy dip. ""Aaj uska paani itna ganda hai, chamdi ka rog ho jaye (now the water is so dirty one would get skin disease)."" The river is taking revenge for years of abuse.

FORCE OF NATURE

Disasters caused by natural and human-induced hazards destroy countless historical properties every year, writes Rohit Jigyasu, vice-president of the International Council on Monuments and Sites, in his study 'Heritage and Resilience' presented in Geneva in May 2013. Of these, ""hydro-meteorological hazards, such as floods and storms"", have had some of the most dramatic impacts in recent years: from the Ayutthaya World Heritage Site in Thailand to New York's Statue of Liberty and UK's prehistoric Stonehenge monument. Is the Taj vulnerable to heavy rain and flooding?

The biggest vulnerability of the Taj to flooding lies in its foundation: because the Yamuna touched the monument on one side (now the river has shrunk and moved away); because the ground slopes toward the river bank; and because it stands on a floodplain (soil saturated with water). Emperor Shah Jahan was fully aware of all this. Precisely why the Taj sits pretty along a sharp bend in the Yamuna: not just for visual delight, but because such curves slow down a river and reduce its thrusts and scouring (or loss of soil, often around the foundation), explains S.C. Handa, former director of IIT-Roorkee, who surveyed the Taj in the 1990s.

Shah Jahan chose the spot deliberately, writes court historian Abd al-Hamid Lahawri, so that his dream mausoleum would be protected from floods, storms and erosion. The entire structure was made on a solid bed of masonry. But despite that, there had been problems from time to time.

Four years after its completion, Shah Jahan's son Aurangzeb noticed cracks in the seven underground chambers after an unprecedented flood. To prevent a recurrence, a groin wall was built in the position of maximum scour. Rubble pitching was done at the base of the wall adjoining the river in the form of rubble masonry in wooden crates. What is the condition of the foundation now? No one knows.

The Taj Mahal has weathered at least eight hydro-meteorological hazards between 1956 and 2018. In the cataclysmic flooding of 1978 in northern India, the Yamuna had overtopped its banks and put nearly the entire old city under water. The monument was protected by piling sandbags around it. In 2003, the Rs 17 crore project to build a complex of shopping malls, restaurants, boat club and open-air entertainment spots adjoining the Taj had exposed it to the same threat, with the Uttar Pradesh government narrowing the course of the Yamuna and flood water carrying debris of construction material.

The Yamuna went through repeated flooding, through 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2016, but to a much lesser extent. According to the Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee on environment in the Taj Trapezium Zone (that extends 50 km outwards from the Taj), the river has become far too shallow with silt accumulation. Hence, a flood of the intensity of 1978 striking Agra again could wreak havoc. The problem, though, could be resolved if the government undertook desilting of the Yamuna, at least for a few metres, says geologist Anil Kumar Misra, professor at Sikkim University, Gangtok.

WHO CARES FOR A RIVER

Not Haryana. After emptying the Yamuna of 98 per cent of its water for irrigation and domestic consumption at the Hathnikund Barrage, Haryana started polluting the water with pesticides and chemical fertilisers. Almost every flooding in the past two decades has been caused by Haryana releasing excess water unexpectedly. On July 26, 131,000 cusecs of water was released, making the Yamuna cross danger levels.

For that perfect picture of sunrise and sunset behind the Taj, Hathi Ghat is the place to be in. But there is not a drop of water in sight. A busy river port once, where the royal elephants came to bathe, it now hosts a motley crowd of men and women peddling trinkets in a carnival atmosphere. Buffaloes and dogs loll around; washermen pound clothes in perfect rhythm; men and women throw flowers into the puddles and cry, ""Jai Bulaki Baba ki""-the reigning deity of Hathi Ghat.

Muqsud Mian does what his ancestors have done for the past 15 generations: wash clothes for the Mughal royals. He does it exactly as they did it: on the banks of the Yamuna. Unlike his ancestors, who used natural sodium bicarbonate (saji mitti), he uses bar soaps and other detergents. Does he know that the Supreme Court, while disposing of advocate M.C. Mehta's PIL on pollution around the Taj, directed that washermen would not be allowed to use the riverbed anymore?

As evening descends, the Itmad-ud-Daulah View Point, a little distance away, becomes a blur of energy and excitement. Diyas flicker to life, conch shells cast a spell. A crowd of men, women and children chants prayers in honour of a river that was, vowing to rescue it. ""We have been holding Yamuna aarti for the past several years to make citizens aware and wake up the government,"" says Dr Devashish Bhattacharya, a physician and an active member of River Connect Campaign.

About 90 drains discharge untreated effluent and sewage into the river, only 29 have wire meshing. ""We have drilled the ground,"" says doctor and river activist Harendra Gupta, ""and it's packed with plastic, polythene, waste leather cuttings from the shoe factories up to about 10 ft under the river bed.""

That's not all: they organise walks demanding release of water into the Yamuna and speeding up cleaning programmes; they bring oxygen cylinders to draw attention to the fact that the river has zero oxygen; they pour sand over themselves and pretend to swim on the dry river bed; they write to the president, prime minister, water resources minister and the Uttar Pradesh chief minister on the concretisation of the Yamuna riverbed; they demand auditing of Yamuna cleaning expenses, especially foreign loans (namely, Rs 937 crore from the Japan International Cooperation Agency); they float hundreds of paper boats in a dry Yamuna to remind Union transport and shipping minister Nitin Gadkari of his 2014 promise: that soon it will be possible to go to Agra ""sailing"" on the Yamuna, with ""help from the Netherlands government"".

COUNTING THE BROKEN PROMISES

In November 2013, when Narendra Modi came to Agra to campaign for the BJP, his first promise was to provide safe drinking water by reviving the Yamuna. Almost five years later, there is no relief in sight. The Yamuna Action Plan, which was initially funded by Japan decades earlier, has failed to bring about any results.

A senior administration official says the Yamuna Action Plan has been limited to files and neither the state nor the central government pays attention to the requests of residents for a clean Yamuna. The sewer lines are still flowing untapped into the river despite the expense of several crores on treatment plants on all sewer lines.

""There has been little improvement in the state of the Yamuna since 2014,"" says Brij Khandelwal of the Blue Yamuna Foundation. ""It has become worse as the river remains dry year-long now, filled only with the city's sewage and whatever flows down from Mathura."" To Khandelwal, the pathetic state of the river is the primary reason why the Taj has been facing insect attacks.

The yellowing of the monument is also because there is no water in the Yamuna to absorb the air pollutants and suspended particulate matter. ""Unless the Yamuna is refilled with clean water, there is no hope the beauty of the Taj will survive another 100 years,"" he says. ""And until the Yamuna is revived, our Yamuna aarti will continue unabated.""

According to available information, the Hathnikund Barrage has released over 600,000 cusecs of water, to which the Gokul Barrage (Mathura) has added 45,011 cusecs. With the river brimming with water now, residents are rushing to witness that rare phenomenon: a famously blue, magical and mighty river flowing as it should. They are offering diyas to the river and praying: for good rains, for the prosperity of the city and for the long life of their very own mausoleum with soaring minarets-the Taj Mahal.

Video: Reuters

At least 324 people have died in India's southern Kerala state over the past week due to severe monsoon flooding, the worst in the state for over a century.

The office of state chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan issued a new ""red alert"" on Friday, warning of more rain in 13 of the province's 14 districts over the weekend, exacerbating an already grim situation.

‚ÄúWe are witnessing something that has never happened before in Kerala‚Äôs history,‚Äù Mr Vijayan told reporters. He said the majority of the state‚Äôs power and water treatment plants had been submerged, prompting shortages of electricity and drinking water.

State educational institutions and commercial establishments have remained closed for over a week and, citing safety concerns, the authorities have banned tourists from visiting the region.

Officials said the floodwaters that have swept across Kerala since August 8th have left more than 223,000 people homeless. They have also forced the closure of the state‚Äôs Kochi international airport on the southwest coast, until the end of the month.

Reports from the state capital Thiruvananthapuram said that the airport's runway was under several feet of water and many aircraft had been water damaged.

Rail and road links to Kochi, which is also Kerala‚Äôs commercial capital and a popular tourist destination during the monsoon months, were impassable, leading to traffic jams and hundreds of cars being washed away.

Thousands of personnel from the federal National Disaster Response Force, the military and the Indian Coast Guard have been deployed to rescue people from flood-affected regions via helicopters and boats, ferrying them to crowded relief camps set up on high ground.

Disease

Naval divers ferried scores of people, including women and children stranded in fast flowing waters, to safety. Military medical and relief teams were monitoring the evacuees, inoculating them against the outbreak of disease and supplying them with drinking water and food.

The state government has urged locals not to ignore evacuation orders and to move to state-run relief camps.

Mobile telephone operators had offered free call and data services for a week to subscribers, but officials said power breakdowns had made it difficult for users to recharge their phones.

Military officials said there had been a high animal death toll, especially of elephants. Kerala is renowned for its many game reserves.

There was also concern over an outbreak of diseases such as cholera and typhoid once the floodwaters had receded.

Prime minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to visit Kerala late on Friday night after attending the funeral of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Delhi. Mr Modi is to tour Kerala's flood-affected regions on Saturday. Federal officials said he was expected to commit more relief and humanitarian assistance to battle Kerala's floods and their aftermath.

Kerala last saw severe flooding in 1924, but officials said it was not nearly as overwhelming as the current devastation.

Splurge and save now! Click here

‚ÄúNot all extreme rain events can be linked to aerosols as other meteorological factors also play a role, but cases of extreme and erratic monsoon rainfall in inland areas affected by air pollution may be linked to this phenomenon,‚Äù said Sachchida N Tripathi, co-author of the study and head of department of civil engineering at IIT, Kanpur.

Aerosols, particularly black carbon and dust particles, induce ‚Äúcloud invigoration‚Äù, which means cloud cover and thickness increases because of reduction in the size of cloud droplets and other structural modifications during cloud formation.

Enhanced cloudiness reflects more sunlight back to space, leading to a cooling effect of the clouds‚Äô surface. The enhanced cloud cover limits reflection of solar energy back to space and traps the energy emitted from the surface at night and decreases the surface diurnal temperature range to make days cooler and nights warmer.

Apart from cooling, air pollution-induced cloud properties can also be linked to intense rainfall. ‚ÄúThis has implications on soil infiltration and ground water storage as heavy rainfall will mainly result in instantaneous surface run off and flash floods. These associations indicate a shift in rainfall pattern towards more intense rainfall over a particular place if air pollution levels rise in future and climate change can exaggerate this effect,‚Äù said Tripathi.

It also makes monsoon rainfall more erratic by causing breaks in its progression. ‚ÄúFor the monsoon to progress, we need favourable conditions... Our data suggests that aerosols are causing cloud invigoration and facilitating thunderstorm-type clouds that have an umbrella type structure. This umbrella structure stops solar radiation and creates cooling, which causes a delay in the arrival of the next thunderstorm. This leads to episodes of intense rain followed by breaks in progression,‚Äù said Dilip Ganguly, co-author and assistant Professor in the Centre for Atmospheric Sciences, IIT Delhi. He added that all pollution particles are not responsible for this aberration in cloud properties. ‚ÄúOnly those aerosols that absorb solar radiation, such as soot, cause these disturbances,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe main sources of aerosols are fossil and bio-fuels combustion from residential and industrial sector, biomass burning and forest fires,‚Äù said Tripathi.

‚ÄúWe cannot comment on how aerosols are impacting monsoon, but our scientists have noticed an increase in heavy or extreme rainfall events in the past 10 to 15 years while there is no major change in cumulative monsoon rainfall or clear trends in overall monsoon pattern,‚Äù said Charan Singh, a scientist at National Weather Forecasting Centre.",,2019 Uttarakhand Floods,"Uttarakhand, India",17-Jul-19,21-Jul-19,"Uttarakhand, India",300 mm,USD 6.8 billion,200,Thousands of people were displaced from their homes and infrastructure was damaged.,"The floods were caused by heavy rainfall in the state of Uttarakhand, India.

As they started their journey back home on Thursday, the nearly two lakh farmers and workers who camped at various places in Delhi, including Ramlila Maidan and Sahibabad camp in Uttar Pradesh bordering Delhi, were determined to carry forward their collective struggle against the anti-worker and farmer Modi-government in Centre.

After all, despite the language barriers, they had marched together on the streets of Delhi under the red flag to voice their demands, including loan waivers, land for the landless, more jobs, better wages and prices for agricultural produces, social security, education and health for all and end to privatisation and contractorisation. The rally was jointly organised by Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) and All India Agricultural Workers Union (AIAWU).

They had poured into the Capital braving all odds -- from flood-hit Kerala to Kashmir, from Manipur where the BJP-led state government had tried targeting trade unionists, from Gujarat that has witnessed a massive movement of farmers against the bullet train project, from Maharashtra where they held a long march.

‚ÄúMore than 30,000 farmers who camped in Ramlila Maidan started to return right after the protest. However, more than 2,000 were there on Wednesday too,‚Äù said Vijoo Krishnan, Joint Secretary of AIKS.

He said the ‚ÄúNashik farmers who reached in Delhi in a special train have returned in a special train itself,‚Äù The heroes of historic Kisan Long March, farmers and Adivasi peasants from Maharashtra's Nashik came to Delhi to be the part of the rally. Among the 40,000 farmers who marched to Mumbai from Nashik for seven days from March 6 to 12 covering a distance of 180 km, over 5,000 rallied in Delhi.

‚ÄúThe floods smashed our plans. Actually, more comrades were supposed to be with us for the Mazdoor Kisan Sangharsh Rally. Yet, we are here to protest against the anti-worker policies of the Modi-government,‚Äù said Beeran from Kerala, who came for the rally representing headload workers. Beeran, along with his colleagues, hails from Ernakulam district‚Äôs Aluva.

‚ÄúEarlier, it was decided that 1,600 people from Ernakulam, one of most flood-affected districts, would head to Delhi.After the floods, we have decided to focus on rehabilitation works, yet more than 900 people participated in the rally from the district alone,‚Äù C.K. Manishankar, Ernakulam District secretary of CITU, told Newsclick.

The rehabilitation works, including cleaning and disinfecting water bodies, are still going on.

‚ÄúDuring the floods, the water level rose up to the sunshade of our house. All the household utensils were damaged and we were forced to relocate from there,‚Äù said Kunjumon who represents autorickshaw workers in Aluva area, who came to Delhi despite being badly hit by the floods..

Aluva which is located on the banks of the Periyar river was one of the worst-hit areas. About 50,000 flood-hit people had been housed in nearly 200 relief camps in Aluva and nearby areas.

‚ÄúWhen we started from there, the distribution of relief kit was going on and we all were volunteering,‚Äù said Ashokan, another worker from Aluva. A relief kit of essential food grains and materials have been distributed by the state government to the families who return from the relief camps to their own houses. The Left Democratic Government in the state has also distributed emergency assistance of Rs 10,000 to flood-affected families. Till Monday, 1.5 lakh relief kits were distributed in Ernakulam district alone.

While a group of four young farmers from Kerala‚Äôs Palakkad rode their bikes to Delhi covering various states and meeting farmers from those regions. One among those young farmers, Swaroop, said he was inspired by the Maharashtra Kisan Long March.

The rally was also joined with workers from various sectors including industrial workers, service sector workers and bank workers along with others. The scheme workers- mainly ASHA workers, Anganwadi workers, midday meal workers- who earn hardly Rs 1500 per month have also joined with the rally demanding ‚Äúminimum salary of Rs 18,000 per month and permanentisation.‚Äù",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The devastation wrought by the Kerala floods of August could not be attributed to the release of water from dams, says a computer-simulation of flood storage and flow patterns by a team of researchers.

Scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras and the Purdue University, United States, say that the odds of such floods were ‚Äú0.06%‚Äù and no reservoir management could have considered such scenarios.

Previous analyses of the Kerala floods had not incorporated a simulation of water flows and relied only on measurements of water levels at dam sites, according to the authors of the study.

Kerala has 39 major dams. and they are maintained by the Kerala State Electricity Board and the Water Resources Department.

All 39 dams in the State had reached their full reservoir level by July-end, and were incapable of absorbing the torrential volumes in August leaving dam-managers with no choice but to release them. The scientists analysed different scenarios with combinations of reservoir storages (85%, 75%, 150% and 25%) at different time periods (end of June and end of July), along with different soil moisture conditions, which has a bearing on river flows.

What they found was that in the hypothetical scenario that there were no dams in the Pamba River Basin (PRB) ‚Äî there are 17 dams and barrages ‚Äî the ‚Äúpeak discharge‚Äù at locations downstream of the Idukki reservoir would have been ‚Äúreduced by 31%.‚Äù This, however, wasn‚Äôt a reduction enough to have prevented the inundation, according to the researchers.

‚ÄúThe major share of the total flood flow was by Perinjankutty (3,500 m3/s), which is a near uncontrolled tributary, while the 14 controlled releases from Idukki had contributed only 1, 860 m3/s‚Ä¶ the results indicated that the role of releases from the major reservoirs in the PRB to cause the flood havoc was less,‚Äù the authors say in the study to be published in a forthcoming issue of the peer-reviewed Current Science .

A simulation of the section of the Periyar river at Neeleswaram showed that even if reservoirs were emptied out to their dead-storage levels of 25%, it still would have meant flows far in excess of the maximum capacity that could have been contained with the river banks. ‚ÄúMost dams are designed to store as much water as possible to the full reservoir level for hydropower planning,‚Äù said K.P. Sudheer, Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, IIT-M. ‚ÄúSo, maintaining 25% storage beats the point of having a dam in the first place.‚Äù

For future planning, authorities must put in place an ‚Äúintegrated flow management‚Äù system, that is, view dams as critical to managing floods and not merely a fount for producing electricity. Additionally, weather forecasting agencies ought to be giving more quantitative forecasts ‚Äî of the likelihood of water volumes rather than descriptions of ‚Äòextreme events‚Äô ‚Äî regarding expected water levels during possible floods, Mr. Sudheer added.",flood,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India",15-Aug-18,21-Aug-18,Kerala,300 mm,USD 3.6 billion,484,10 million people affected,"The floods were caused by heavy rainfall in the Western Ghats.

delhi,2018,https://thewire.in/the-sciences/new-study-examines-kerala-floods-links-to-climate-change,28-Nov-18,New Study Examines Kerala Floods' Links to Climate Change,"New Delhi: The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events in India appears to be on the rise, as projected by various scientific assessments on climate change. But it may not be right to connect every such event with climate change. This is what a new study on the recent Kerala floods highlights.

It was conducted by researchers at the Water and Climate Lab at IIT Gandhinagar. It is based on an analysis of rainfall, temperature and extreme events data in Kerala between 1951 and 2017, together with model simulations.

In this period, Kerala saw significant decline in monsoon rainfall and increase in temperature during the monsoon months. The incidence of heavy rainfall over one or two days also dropped. All together, they suggest Kerala has experienced more drying and warming during the monsoon season since 1951.

‚ÄúSince we do not find any increase in the mean or extreme monsoon season precipitation during 1951-2017, attributing 2018 flood in Kerala to climate change can be difficult. Despite the significant warming observed in the last 66 years, the mean and extreme precipitation and total runoff have not increased,‚Äù researchers Vimal Mishra and Harsh L. Shah observed in their study‚Äôs paper, published in the Journal of Geological Society of India.

Instead, the study says, the extreme precipitation and floods of 2018 might have been caused by anomalous large-scale circulation features. Older studies have demonstrated the impact of deforestation on monsoon rainfall in the Western Ghats. Changes in land use and cover also affect hydrological conditions, which in turn can affect flood peaks and inundation. Still ‚Äúhow much impact historic land cover change in Kerala had on the severity of flood in August 2018 is yet to be understood,‚Äù the study says.

‚ÄúThe situation of reservoirs might have played a key role in at least worsening the flood,‚Äù the researchers said. The group had earlier reported that excessive rainfall resulted in ‚Äòabove normal‚Äô reservoir storage prior to the extreme rainfall on August 15 and 16. ‚ÄúThe extreme precipitation in catchments of major reservoirs forced reservoir operators to open the gates and release considerable amount of stored water, which might have added to the severity of floods,‚Äù the study speculates.

However, other climate experts do not agree that all extreme weather events need not be a result of local warming.

‚ÄúThe study is not focused on the mechanism that produced the extremes rain. I do not agree with the speculation that it is part of natural variability just because, thus far, Kerala has not seen an increase in the mean or extremes,‚Äù said Raghu Murtugudde, an Earth-system scientist at the University of Maryland and a visiting professor at IIT Bombay.

‚ÄúThe entire process of loading the atmosphere with moisture because of warming is precisely that a one-in-a-100- or -50-year event can begin to occur more frequently.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is important to note that the climate evolution of the next 25 years is already determined by the human carbon emission of the past decades. That is why we know already now that the river flood risk will increase in the next 25 years and that we have to protect against these changes,‚Äù Anders Levermann, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and co-author of the paper said in an email interview. ‚ÄúThis is particularly important for India which will face a significant increase in flood risk throughout the country.‚Äù

The study examined flooding events in 1971 to 2004, and a future period, 2035 to 2044 and found that there is a strong flood risk 26 of India‚Äôs 36 states. Bihar could be one of the worst affected states.

The climate change impacts that the study considers are from emissions that have already taken place.

‚ÄúIn light of possible future flood events, a number of countries with a large population and strong economic performance (for example, India and the United States) require extensive adaptation measures to keep flood risk at its present level,‚Äù the study said.

‚ÄúThe reason that is so many people will be impacted because there is more exposure; more people and assets are in the flood zone,‚Äù Kamal Kishore, a senior official at the National Disaster Management Authority, said. ‚Äú2017 was one of the worst flood years in the last 20 years, even though the monsoon was slightly below normal. The same amount of rainfall is happening in fewer days. You are beginning to see a shift in the way that rainfall occurs.‚Äù

‚ÄúMuch better land use management happening, modernisation of flood control structures and systemization of flood management information system, will contribute to resilience,‚Äù Kishore added.

The research assumes a fixed population and distribution. A surprising finding of the work was that developed countries may need the same if not more intense adaptation efforts to maintain the same level of flood protection.

‚ÄúOne important outcome is that in order to keep the protection level in the next 25 years the same as it was in the past 25 years the US and Northern Europe requires as much adaptation effort as does India and Indonesia,‚Äù Levermann said.

The National Disaster Management Authority is hosting a two-day workshop in Delhi next week to promote cooperation among nations - including developing and developed countries - to build disaster resilient infrastructure as mandated by the Sendai framework, a 15 -year voluntary agreement of which India is a part.

Splurge and save now! Click here

‚ÄúTough days are ahead,‚Äù chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said Monday when asked about his government‚Äôs plans to start the reconstruction work. ‚ÄúOver a million people are in the relief camps and as of now they are our priority. We are assessing human and material damage,‚Äù he added.

The government estimates about one lakh buildings, which includes people‚Äôs houses, have been damaged,over 10,000km of highways and roads and hundreds of bridges have been washed away, and crops in millions of hectares of land have been lost in the Kerala floods.

The government will start the process to accurately assess the damage after the relief and rescue work is over, an official said.

Experts say that an area under severe flood could take up to a decade to fully recover. A 2015 paper by Prakash Tripathi of Ambedkar University, titled ‚ÄòFlood Disaster in India: An Analysis of trend and Preparedness‚Äô, pointed out that completing relief and rehabilitation work takes about two years on average while the ecological recovery could take up to more than five years.

Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People spoke of ‚Äúdifferent aspects of recovery‚Äù ‚Äî the human aspect, which involves rehabilitation, and creation of systems, which enables reducing the impact of future floods. ‚ÄúWe cannot stop floods. But we can minimise their impact. For that, some structural re-engineering to ensure that the rivers can flow freely is needed. This takes time.‚Äù

Thakkar isn‚Äôt off the mark. Four years after the devastating floods in Kashmir, which saw its 2.61 lakh homes partially or completely damaged, the recovery work is still not over even though the government has paid compensation to those affected.

The state and central governments differ on their estimates of the damage caused in the Valley.

Chief engineer in the state‚Äôs irrigation and flood control department, MM Shahnawaz said in the first phase, they filled all breaches and strengthened the embankments. ‚ÄúFrom 32,000 cusecs of water, we increased river Jhelum‚Äôs carrying capacity to 41,000 cusecs. We are further planning to increase it to 60,000 cusecs in coming years,‚Äù he said.

The chief engineer said that in the second phase a Spanish company has been engaged to formulate comprehensive flood mitigation and river management and the project will be completed in five to seven years. As a long term plan, the state government also plans to construct storage dams for the tributaries of the river or constructing a separate flood spill channel.

Similar is the story in Uttarakhand, where upper reaches were ravaged by the devastating June 2013 flash floods in the Mandakini and Alaknanda rivers that impacted around nine million people and left close to 200 people dead. Kedarnath in Rudraprayag districts were worst affected where flash floods washed away the 16 km trek from the shrine till Gaurikund.

Amit Singh Negi, secretary disaster management, said, ‚ÄúWe received over R 1000 crore from the central government for rescue and relief. The money has been disbursed but the strengthening of roads and other structures is going on.‚Äù

The state government officials, however, refused to comment on failure to remove encroachments on the river flood plain that was the cause for major loss of human life. This still poses a huge bottleneck to prevent re-run of 2013.

The northern parts of Bihar were ravaged by the huge breach in the embankment on Kosi river on India-Nepal border in 2008. It affected 3.3 million people and left 527 dead. Around 6.6 million hectares of agriculture land became unfit for cultivation because of excessive siltation.

Ten years on, the Bihar government is still struggling to provide an alternate to farmers. The officials said the state has initiated measures including subsidy to adopt new crops but the results have not been very encouraging.

The relief and rehabilitation work started by the state government, though helped mitigate the problem, is also still not over.

The World Bank-aided Kosi Flood Recovery Project of $220 million, which was initially supposed to be completed by September 2014, was extended to June 2018. The bank is also funding Bihar Kosi Basin Development project of $250 million with completion deadline of March 2023.

Assam, the state which receives floods on annual basis due to river Brahmaputra‚Äôs fury, has taken a large number of steps such as building embankments to minimise the damage but, according to the river board, the impact had been minimal as people continue to live in floodplains.

The board, however, suggested in its 2017 report that building of huge storage dams upstream of the river can control the impact of floods, which the activists say could prove to be ‚Äúdisastrous‚Äù as it has happened in Kerala.

‚ÄúWe have to learn from Kerala that just development big storage dams may not help. When it rains heavily, the dam gates have been opened which results in excessive flooding. Instead, we need to work on flood management, which basically means removing encroachments from traditional water flow zones and allowing excess water to flow smoothly into oceans,‚Äù Thakkar said.

Former Central Water Commission chairperson A B Pandya said creating storage dams helps both in generating electricity and managing floods.

‚ÄúIf Tehri Dam would not have been there, the damage because of the Uttarkhand floods would have been much more. We have seen in north-east also that the impact of floods is less because of the dams,‚Äù he said.

According to CWC data, the floods are responsible for deaths of 84% of people in all natural disasters in India. ‚ÄúThe recurrence and intensity of floods has amplified over the time (especially after 1970s) which damages life and costs economy dearly,‚Äù said Prakash Tripathi in his study, which also said there was a need for effective pre-and post-disaster mechanism as the nature cannot be checked but disaster can be reduced.

The torrential rainfall in the state has left 37 people dead in the last five days. According to the preliminary assessment by the state government, Kerala has suffered a loss of Rs 8,316 crore, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who did an aerial survey of the flood-affected parts on Sunday, announced a relief of Rs. 100 crore.

The IMD, in its fresh warning, issued a ‚ÄòRed alert‚Äô, asking people to be cautious as there was a possibility of heavy to very heavy rainfall in most places in Idukki, Wayanad, Kannur, Ernakulam, Palakkad and Malappuram districts in the next 48 hours. Fishermen have also been advised to stay away from the Southwest and Central Arabian Sea as conditions are likely to be very rough.

However, the water level in Idukki and Idamalayar dams receded, bringing some relief to the people. The water level in Idukki dam, which shot up to 2,401 ft on Thursday, came down to 2,398.50 ft Sunday evening, mitigating the fear of flood in Ernakulam district. The dam, opened after a gap of 26 years, has been discharging water at the rate of 750 cubic meters per second since Friday.

Vijayan pegs damage at over Rs 8,000 crore

As per the preliminary assessment, the rains have caused an approximate loss of Rs 8,315 crore, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a memorandum submitted to the Centre. The memorandum sought urgent sanction of Rs 1,220 crore from the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) to meet the situation. ‚ÄúState Government would request the Union Govt. to declare the calamity as that of ‚Äòrare severity‚Äô and provide the required funds and assistance,‚Äù Vijayan said, adding that the impact of the monsoon havoc will be felt for a long time in the state.

Following unprecedented rainfall in Kerala, as many as 31,075 people were staying in 302 temporary relief camps. As many as 211 incidents of landslides were reported during the period. Ten columns of the Army, a unit of Madras Regiment along with personnel of the Navy, Air Force and NDRF are engaged in relief and rescue work in badly-hit districts, including Kozhikode, Idukki, Malappuram, Kannur and Wayanad, Defence sources said. Nearly 20,000 houses and at least 10,000 km of roads have also been damaged in the floods.

After Kochi airport was flooded on August 15, airlines were asked to fly to Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode. Meanwhile, on August 16, the Civil Aviation Ministry proposed that Kochi‚Äôs naval airbase be used for civilian flights.

Joint Secretary Usha Padhee created a WhatsApp group connecting the ministry, Kerala‚Äôs Chief Secretary, and the important players in Kochi. In less than 30 hours, regulatory agencies conducted a test flight at the naval facility, and security equipment like x-ray machines and baggage scanners from Thiruvananthapuram were shifted in.

Airlines started flights with smaller ATR planes from August 20, five days after Kochi airport was forced to close.

Civil Aviation Secretary R.N. Choubey praised Alliance Air, Bureau of Civil Aviation Security, and ground handling personnel, among others, for going beyond the call of duty. ‚ÄúIt has been a heroic effort on the part of government agencies, whose own family members were trapped or stranded. CISF jawans even volunteered to swim to the Naval airbase!

Vistara, which flew only to Kochi, set up a new station in Thiruvananthapuram in 14 hours, something that normally takes weeks.

Splurge and save now! Click here

The monsoon season is a dangerous and unsettling time in India, with most deaths reported from heavy rains and flooding in the four months of rain from June to September.

‚ÄúIncreasing trends in daily extreme precipitation in India have been observed during the recent 46 decades,‚Äù a recent paper said. ‚ÄúMoreover, urban areas in India have witnessed 47 eccentric precipitation extremes in the past, which have affected human lives and infrastructure.‚Äù

Between 1950 and 2017, India has reported 285 floods that have impacted 850 million people, left 19 million homeless and killed about 71,000. In the past decade, flood damage has led to losses of US $ 3 billion every year, according to the International Disaster Database.

But it is the short bursts of extreme precipitation that has scientists worried. Such events may boost the total amount of rainfall but they do not necessarily reduce water stress or significantly recharge the water table. On the contrary, much of the rain discharge is difficult to manage and often causes flash floods, which is detrimental to infrastructure.

Incidences of extreme rainfall, that precipitates flooding, are projected to increase as the planet warms. India is not just highly prone to weather-related disasters, its high population density and poor infrastructure also puts its people at higher risk. In the last two years alone, 25 million people have suffered impacts from heavy rains and floods and at least 2,000 people have died in these episodes.

In India, both large-scale floods from continuous heavy downpours and flash floods from sudden bursts of rain are expected to strike more often.

‚ÄúA warming climate will cause more intense and more frequent extreme rain events,‚Äù Vimal Mishra, a climate scientist at IIT Gandhinagar, said. The increase in rainfall extremes is being driven by anthropogenic warming, Mishra and his colleagues said in a 2018 paper, noting that in the worst case scenario of unchecked greenhouse gas emissions, such events will increase significantly over south and central India by 2050.

‚ÄúFor cities, daily rainfall data is not that helpful, even 5-10 minutes of heavy rain can flood a city and pose a risk to the infrastructure,‚Äù Mishra said. Which is why the scientist is calling for improving understanding of sub-daily rainfall patterns that include rainfall spurts over less than 24 hours.‚ÄùThere isn‚Äôt enough focus on sub-daily rainfall events,‚Äù he said.

A paper by Mishra and his team showed that such short duration rainfall events that can trigger flash floods are even more sensitive to warming temperatures than 24-hour rainfall extremes. If there is an increase in average temperatures of 1 degree Celsius, there would be a greater increase in the events of sub-daily rainfall extremes than daily extremes.

The researchers found that the frequency of such events would increase by 20% if global temperature rises by 1.5 degrees Celsius and by 25% if they increase by 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial level.

Other researchers have reached similar conclusions about widespread extreme rains that causes flooding.

‚ÄúWe looked at the entire country and found a threefold increase in widespread extreme rain events over central India,‚Äù Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, said. ‚ÄúBarring a few pockets of the country, the country overall is likely to see an increase in such events.‚Äù

Widespread rainfall events that occur over multiple days and cover a large swathe of area (running into thousands of square kms) are known to cause large-scale floods. The 2005 Maharashtra flood on July 26 and July 27, which led to over 1,000 deaths across the state and brought Mumbai to a standstill, is an example of this.

When temperature increases, it raises the moisture-holding capacity of the atmosphere. Scientists have reported an increase in moisture content in the atmosphere over the Indian subcontinent.

While this may sound like good news, the distribution of the rain over space and time muddies such a straightforward understanding. More rain is not a blessing when it is dumped over short periods of time.

It‚Äôs not just local warming, but region-wide warming is having an impact on India‚Äôs rainfall patterns, according to Koll.

‚ÄúIt is not the local temperatures, warming that is not even exactly over the Indian subcontinent has resulted in more moisture availability,‚Äù he explained. ‚Äú It is coming from the Arabian Sea, so warming elsewhere will also impact extreme rainfall events over Indian subcontinent.‚Äù

The situation is being constantly reviewed in consultation with the state government.""The aviation ministry had on Wednesday asked airlines to reschedule their flights to the city and operate them to nearby airports of Calicut and Trivandrum. The DGCA has directed airlines not to hike fares on these flights due to the sudden rush. For example, the regulator has asked Delhi-Trivandrum fare should not exceed Rs 10,000.A day later on Thursday, the DGCA is inundated with complaints of high airfares to Kerala, despite the regulator asking airlines to keep fares to Trivandrum and Calicut under check due to sudden rise in demand on the sectors following the closure of the flooded Kochi airport. Airline websites show Delhi-Trivandrum fares for remaining last few seats on direct flights Thursday in the range of Rs 15,000-36,000 in economy and up to Rs 81,000 in business.‚ÄúThe DGCA does not have any authority to dictate fares to airlines.

‚ÄúKaziranga lost a number of animals during the two incidences of recent floods,‚Äù environment minister Mahesh Sharma said in the Lok Sabha this winter session.

The death toll of rhinos is the highest for three years. But these deaths are from drowning in floodwaters, not from poachers‚Äô bullets or poison.

According to official records till December 26 last year, eight rhinos were killed by poachers in Assam, which has three more parks with rhinos, though the numbers are far less than Kaziranga‚Äôs population.

Wildlife authorities have brought down the killing of this majestic animal prized for their horn that feeds a multi-million dollar clandestine international market for the ivory and its perceived aphrodisiac properties.

Rhinos in Kaziranga were relatively safe this year from poachers, but torrential rain triggered heavy flooding twice last year in the park straddling the Brahmaputra floodplains and Burha Pahar hills.

The park located 200km east of Guwahati lost nine elephants as the Brahmaputra breached its banks and inundated large tracts of the foothills.

The annual floods are important to rejuvenate the park‚Äôs unique eco-system of grassland, swamps and ponds that sustain a large population of rhinos, elephants, deer, wild buffaloes, tigers and leopards. But a devastating flood puts the animals in danger, like it did in 1988 when more than 1,000 animals perished.

Between 2002 and 2017, 130 rhinos have died in floods in Kaziranga, which has registered a steady rise in population of its one-horned centerpiece from 1,855 in 2006 to 2,401 in 2015.

The hog deer was the biggest casualty, with 282 dying in floods and 14 becoming road kill. The park also lost a tiger, 16 Sambar deer and eight buffalos to floods in 2017.

In addition to the state government, the Union government is closely coordinating the deployment of central resources, including those from the Army, Navy and the Air Force.

The National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC), headed by cabinet secretary PK Sinha, met for the third time in three days on Saturday to review the rescue and relief operations.

Union rail minister Piyush Goyal said his ministry was also pitching in. ‚ÄúRailways will now provide free transportation of relief material for Kerala through various State Govt agencies, PSUs and other Government agencies,‚Äù Goyal tweeted.

Central ministries had till Saturday pitched in with 300,000 food packets, 600,000 MT of milk, 1,400,000 litres of drinking water and 150 potable water purification kits.

They waded and stumbled through waist-deep muddy water and slush for hours to reach a relief camp in Pandalam, in rain-ravaged Pathanamthitta district, Central Kerala. Dr Bijin Joseph, a specialist in family medicine, along with his medical team of 16, with three doctors, eight nurses and four pharmacists from KIMS hospital in Thiruvananthapuram, wanted to push on.

The raging waters of the Pamba prevented them from progressing further and fishermen warned them against attempting anything foolhardy. Instead, they promised to bring patients to their camp.

‚ÄúIt was pouring. I can never forget the sight of 500 people, young and old, huddled in that camp, because we have never seen a calamity on this scale in Kerala. While the youngsters were actively organising things at the camp, many senior citizens were completely in a state of shock. Many had seen their lives being washed away by the water ‚Äî houses and all their possessions. It was traumatic for all of us too. We were on our feet from 10 am to 9 pm on some days. Our immediate concern was for patients who were on daily medication: those who had diabetes in need of insulin, those with hypertension and cardiac problems. Then there were many, specially young children, with cold and fever,‚Äù recalls Bijin. Through the six days, the team also worked in camps in Ranni, and Seethathodu, both in Pathanamthitta.

Stay alert Since volunteers and residents were forced to live in waterlogged areas and walk through flooded places, rat fever or Leptospirosis is a worry. All those who had to work or live in such conditions are given Doxycycline as a prophylactic medicine.

Snake bites are common in floods when the water recedes, so it is best to wear thick rubber gloves, gum boots and use mechanised equipment to clean houses and buildings.

Keep the skin dry to avoid skin infections and fungal infections. Consult a doctor in case of redness or itching.

To clean wells, flush out as much water as possible. Then opt for a process of super-chlorination: use upto 10g of bleaching powder for every 1,000 litres of water (usually only 2.5g is used). Let it stand for an hour.

In a relief camp in Seethathodu, he learnt that the area had experienced over 30 landslides in a week‚Äôs time. There were villages where houses were completely wiped out. The team had to treat fractures, cuts and bruises. ‚ÄúTwo people had been killed and many families had their houses completely demolished by landslides and floods. They wondered what they had to return to,‚Äù narrates Bijin.

Meanwhile, a huge medical team set off from Thrissur Medical College to camps around Thrissur, in Central Kerala, under the leadership of orthopaedic surgeon Dr Santhosh Kumar, deputy superintendent of Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, and vice-president of Doctors Without Borders in South Asia. On the team were Dr Mohammed Asheel, Dr Bindu DHS, Dr Rahul UR.

‚ÄúA mobile medical unit consisting of a doctor, nurse, and pharmacist was put together and 30 such teams travelled in a bus around Thrissur. There were 30 such buses for offering medical assistance in the camps. Our priority was to treat patients in need of help and also prevent the outbreak of any contagious diseases (measles, chicken pox, typhoid, cholera, diarrhoea). Since thousands of people are living together, it is easy for a contagious disease to reach the levels of an epidemic,‚Äù says Santhosh. He also led a team to Wayanad, aided by an NSS squad from Delhi.

As the waters recede, there are bound to be manifold new issues in the days to come, says Santhosh, who has treated patients hit by various disasters in over 30 countries. ‚ÄúAs the camps are being closed, the threat of an outbreak of contagious diseases has decreased greatly. However, since the water has still not receded in many places in Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta districts, and since people have begun to return to their homes, there are other problems to look out for,‚Äù he explains.

It is also at this stage of such a calamity that respiratory diseases must be carefully monitored. A simple viral infection that results in a cough or cold, can get escalated to become something more serious, like pneumonia.

An immediate concern is a spike or occurrence of rat fever, because of the lack of proper footwear, such as gumboots. Then there is the danger of snake bite and fatal injuries caused by electrical equipment damaged by the flood waters.

Since almost all the wells in these regions have been contaminated, all the sources of drinking water will have to be pumped, cleansed and super-chlorinated, before they can be used.

Even as the water is still going down, vector-borne diseases rear their heads. When the sun comes up and water starts stagnating, the whole life cycle of mosquitoes begins anew.

Based on his experience in working in flood-hit Philippines and Odisha, he says it would be best to use mosquito nets for protection or use mats and ointments to protect oneself from dengue and Japanese encephalitis.

The floods in Kerala are said to be the worst in a century, since 1924.

The doctors also point out the immediate necessity of organising psycho-social support groups to counsel many of the survivors of the flood. ‚ÄúThe plan is to select about 200 volunteers and train them to identify, select and counsel those undergoing emotional stress or trauma. The best way is to have such trained volunteers at clinics, so that they can identify people in need of counselling,‚Äù says Santhosh.

As the State moves into the process of rehabilitating the survivors, medical practitioners gear up for more work, not letting the grief of their own losses come in the way of duty and service.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
delhi,2018,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ZRyfeL0juO4YLXVdyT3JzL/Amid-Kerala-floods-IMD-issues-rain-warning-for-Uttarakhand.html,12-Aug-18,"Amid Kerala floods, IMD issues heavy rain warning for Uttarakhand","New Delhi: Even as Kerala battled floods and landslides , the state-run weather forecaster India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued very-heavy rain warning for Uttrakhand as well, raising concerns over India‚Äôs vulnerability to extreme rainfall events which have recorded a steady rise over recent years. In its latest weather forecast, IMD today issued a ‚Äúred warning"" for Uttarakhand, parts of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Karnataka and east Uttar Pradesh, and asked the states‚Äô authorities to remain alert over the next three days.

‚ÄúHeavy rainfall used to occur in Kerala, but not with such continuity. This time, there has been widespread rain continually for a long time which has not been recorded in recent years. As observed in our studies, intensity of daily rainfall is indeed increasing, especially along the western coast and northeastern states,"" said Dr D.S. Pai, head of climate prediction group at IMD Pune.

Research carried out by IMD scientists published in the Climate Dynamics journal revealed increased disaster potential for instant flooding over Central India, where both intensity and frequency of heavy rainfall shows an upward trend.

‚ÄúOur vulnerability to extreme rainfall is increasing as more people are living in low-lying areas, and land development is changing drainage patterns. When there is more rain than the soil can absorb, water will quickly run off‚Äîoverwhelming streams, drains and rivers, causing flash floods,"" said Dr Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, whose recent study in the Nature magazine showed that number of extreme rainfall events have gone up threefold in India.

According to the study, there have been 285 reported flooding events in India over 1950-2017, affecting about 850 million people, leaving 19 million homeless and killing about 71,000 people. The total damage during this period was estimated to be about $60 billion.

‚ÄúThe loss per year has been increasing and damage due to floods has been about $3 billion per year during the last decade. Extreme rainfall is increasing in frequency and intensity. Idukki district in Kerala, were the flooding is happening currently, is also one such region,"" said Koll.

In its recent State of the Climate report, the US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also raised concerns over high number of casualties in India due to extreme rainfall events last year. As many as 800 lives were lost in heavy rain-triggered incidents in Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar during monsoon last year, noted the global report. Changing demographics, socioeconomic conditions and unplanned urbanization worsen the impact.

Severe weather events have caused catastrophic loss for life and property across the country in recent years. Torrential rainfall caused floods in Jhelum and Chenab in 2014, causing nearly 400 villages in Jammu and Kashmir to submerge. Chennai bore the brunt in November 2015 and Assam in 2016. In 2017, Mumbai and Gujarat were forced to shut down due to record heavy rainfall.

Uttrakhand is yet to recover from the trail of destruction left by flash floods in June 2013‚Äîthe country‚Äôs worst natural disaster since the tsunami in 2004.

The looming threat of global warming further fuels concerns over erratic weather events.

‚ÄúWith increasing carbon dioxide emissions due to human activities, the atmosphere and the oceans are warmer than what it was earlier. Since the atmosphere holds more moisture, it dumps all the moisture together as heavy rainfall,"" said Koll.

According to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), over 12% of the country‚Äôs land is prone to floods and river erosion.

‚ÄúIt was expected that extreme weather events would increase due to climate change, and it is happening across the globe. The effects are evident in India because of its vulnerabilities. This makes it more important to make our climate change mitigation plans more stringent,"" said Dr Malti Goel, former adviser, Department of Science and Technology, and founder, Climate Change Research Institute, Delhi.

A little more than a year ago, another downpour over a few hours, too, had paralysed life in India‚Äôs IT hub. In their report, ‚ÄòUrban Floods, A Case Study of Bangalore‚Äô (Journal of the National Institute of Disaster Management, April 2009), T V Ramachandra and Pradeep P Mujumdar, hydrologists at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, blamed floods in the city on the ‚Äúlack of drainage upgrade works, the encroachment and filling in the floodplain on the waterways, obstruction by the sewer pipes and manholes and relevant structures, deposits of building materials and solid wastes with subsequent blockage of the system, and also flow restrictions from under-capacity road crossings (bridge and culverts)‚Äù.

They wrote that ‚Äúthe lack of planning and enforcement has resulted in significant narrowing of the waterways and filling in of the floodplain by illegal developments‚Äù, which has ‚Äúsubsequently caused flooding to other properties that have not previously been flooded‚Äù.

The repeated flooding in Bengaluru is similar to deluges that drowned Chennai in November 2015 and Srinagar in 2014 ‚Äî even though those floods caused far greater havoc and tragedy. All are the result of urban planners giving the short shrift to a fundamental principle of hydrology: natural water bodies soak up excess rainfall and use it to replenish groundwater; inter-related drainage systems created by these ponds, streams, lakes and channels then release the excess water into larger water bodies ‚Äî oceans and big rivers. Our cities are increasingly getting shorn of such ‚Äòsponges‚Äô.

Bengaluru, Ramachandra and Mujumdar wrote, ‚Äúis just one example of bad water management practices. Years of siltation of tanks have reduced their water storage capacity. Encroachments of nalas, lakes and other water bodies, choking of streams and stormwater drains, have taken their toll‚Äù. In a separate report, ‚ÄòWetlands, Treasure of Bangalore: Abused, Polluted, Encroached and Vanishing‚Äô (December 2015), co-authored with Sudarshan P Bhat, Asulabha K S, Sincy V, and Bharath H Aithal, Ramachandra wrote that 98% of the famous lakes of Bengaluru were encroached, rendering the city vulnerable to flooding even after normal rain. Bengaluru had more than 250 lakes about 50 years ago. Today, fewer than 10 remain in a healthy state.

The pattern is similar elsewhere. After the Srinagar floods of 2014, a report by the New Delhi-based nonprofit sustainable development advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) noted that in the past 100 years, more than 50% of Srinagar‚Äôs lakes, ponds and wetlands have been encroached upon to construct buildings and roads.

The demands of urban development very often turn a city into a flatland that militates against its natural topographical and hydrological features. But when there is excess rainfall, the water follows the city‚Äôs natural incline. Forgotten river channels sometimes spring back to life, but with disastrous consequences. Mumbai authorities had virtually forgotten the city‚Äôs Mithi river until the catastrophic flooding of July 26, 2005. What was once a flowing river had been blocked at every corner; there were encroachments and constructions on the riverbed and at the point where the river would discharge into the sea. In Delhi, a stream used to feed the Yamuna at about the same place where the busy ITO area is today. It is not without reason that the area is one of the worst waterlogged when it rains heavily.

Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai, Srinagar, Delhi, Gurgaon, etc. are all examples of human intervention that have rendered a city unfit to deal with a deluge. But floods are also a natural occurrence. In Assam and north Bihar, for example, they happen almost every year. In his paper, ‚ÄòHydrology of Floods in South Asia‚Äô (November 2002), Shafiqul Islam of the University of Cincinnati showed how a combination of weather patterns and topography leads to regular flooding of the Brahmaputra. As the ice melts in the Himalayas, the water channels downstream swell. When the river enters Assam from Arunachal Pradesh, it experiences a steep fall in gradient, causing the water to hurtle down at a furious pace. During the monsoon, when the river is swollen with the precipitation from the Eastern Himalayas, its channels can‚Äôt take the huge volumes gushing down at high speed. Siltation and sedimentation in the channels compound the situation.

There is, however, a human hand in such floods as well. With increasing deforestation in the Eastern Himalayas, the run-off has increased, which means as the water rushes towards the plains, it carries along more sediment. The riverbed in the plains is full of sediment, impairing the Brahmaputra‚Äôs carrying capacity. Earlier, the forests would soak up a lot of the run-off ‚Äî somewhat like the wetlands.

In Guwahati, the human culpability for the floods increases. The deluge here seems similar to the ones in Bengaluru, or other Indian cities. Guwahati‚Äôs bowl shape anyway makes it prone to waterlogging; poor urban planning has increased its vulnerability. Wetlands that could have soaked up the rainwater or channelled them to the Brahmaputra are choked with garbage; they get clogged during heavy rain and the water spills on to the roads. A 2014 report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority said: ‚ÄúThe city does not have a planned drainage system to take care of sewage, so the natural channels become all the more important. The condition of these channels are not very convincing as they are constantly covered with garbage.‚Äù

delhi,2017,https://www.dw.com/en/narrowing-floodplains-threaten-delhi/a-40461053,12-Sep-17,Floodplain dangers ‚Äì DW ‚Äì 09,"Illegal construction along Delhi's Yamuna River is rampant, eliminating floodplains. This leaves the city vulnerable to floods, and is affecting its groundwater levels.

As in so many major cities around the world, land in Delhi is scarce. To cope with its population of 16 million, the metropolis has begun to spill out onto the floodplains of its Yamuna River.

Construction there is forbidden, but that hasn't prevented the emergence of several residential colonies. One of them is Jaitpur. Its hundreds of new brick houses have been built along the southernmost stretch of the river - on the wrong side of one of 10 embankments built to protect Delhi from flooding.

Major public roads also cut across the land, and even the 2010 Commonwealth Games Village stands in the floodplains.

Even if they were built illegally, it is difficult to demolish structures like this mosque on the floodplains because of their religious nature. Image: Aletta Andre

None of this is legal. In April of this year, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), which is responsible for city planning, to halt all construction on the floodplains and wetlands, and advised moving recently built settlements and industries, such as a few recycling units in the informal sector, beyond the embankments.

Uncertain terrain

Along the 55-kilometer (34-mile) long stretch of the Yamuna within the boundaries of Delhi, the floodplains have been reduced from their natural 5 to 10 kilometers width, to just a few hundred meters. Or in some places, next to nothing.

Construction, such as that in Jaitpur, continues - despite the construction ban in the floodplains, where villagers continue farming.

Though further north, the river is flanked by fields of corn and rice, construction on the floodplains upstream has also left its mark.

""The groundwater level has decreased significantly since my youth,"" says Mange Ram, a farmer in his late 60s. ""Earlier, we had to dig just a few feet to draw water. Now, it is at least 80 feet [24 meters] deep.""

Farmers like Mange Ram have noticed a significant drop in the ground water levels around his fields. Image: Aletta Andre

""Removing all these recent constructions is the only way to restore some of the floodplains and wetlands,"" says ecology professor C.R. Babu, who served as chairman of an expert committee to the NGT.

He says the floodplains can absorb and store floodwaters, and that the wetlands are also home to wildlife. Both serve to recharge the groundwater, which is necessary for agriculture and drinking water needs.

Unclear lines of responsibility

""These constructions are only possible with the tacit backing of local officials and politicians - and they are often authorized before elections, in exchange for votes,"" says Bhim Singh Rawat, who works for the nongovernmental organization South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People.

Exactly who is responsible for stopping further construction seems to be a moot point. In a Times of India report published in June, the DDA stated it was up to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC). It, in turn, said it was a DDA issue.

While different authorities pass the buck, people will ultimately be the ones to suffer.

Further upstream in Delhi, the Yamuna still retains some of its floobplains. But even here farming is increasingly giving way to construction. Image: Aletta Andre

With slightly heavier flooding, which he says happens every 10 to 15 years, he predicts that several government structures including a major bus terminal will be underwater - as well as these houses.

Natural flood capacity

""Floods are characteristic for rivers. But with the floodplains narrowing, [floods] become more intense and damaging,"" Babu adds. Without space to accommodate excess water, water will enter the city - particularly during the monsoon season in July and August, he points out.

Moreover, he says a lot of water is being held by upstream dams, under the management of governments of other Indian states or other countries, like China.

This results in periods of relatively low water, which are inadequate for washing away sand that has previously been deposited on the banks and on wetlands. As a result, the wetlands are drying up. And that has other consequences.

Bauschutt von illegal errichteten H√§usern s√§umt das √∂kologisch wichtige Ufer des Yamuna Image: Aletta Andre

""In Delhi, most wetlands are now silted, if not filled up with solid waste,"" he says. ""And when water is suddenly released from these dams, is causes flash floods downstream - because again, there are not enough wetlands or floodplains for all this water.""

A wasted resource

Despite the dire situation, Babu is cautiously optimistic about the future. ""Floodplains and wetlands can be restored,"" he says, pointing to the Yamuna Biodiversity Park in the north of Delhi, which he spent the past decade helping to set up.

""Migrating birds have started coming again - as have certain types of fish and previously extinct animals, like wild boars.""

And there would be benefits even beyond flood control and richer biodiversity. The floodplains of the Yamuna, if completely restored, could provide drinking water to the entire population of the water-starved city of Delhi, Babu says.

But given that most of the original floodplains have long been built over with unremovable structures including Delhi's essential ring road, that is not likely to happen. Nonetheless, with the right legislation and restrictions, precious free land could at least play some part in resolving the city's drinking water problems.

While tropical storm Harvey in Texas has grabbed more international attention, flooding in South Asia has been quite severe: already a thousand people have died. This year, among the main sufferers of this regular annual event have been the residents of Mumbai, India‚Äôs financial capital. On Tuesday, roads were jammed with residents wading through knee-deep water. Over 30 lakh commuters were affected by delayed local train services as train lines lay inundated. Overcrowded and flooded government hospitals are now facing the risk of spreading infections, exposing citizens to a public health crisis.

Residents were reminded of the 2005 flood that left the city in a similar state of paralysis. Over a thousand people lost their lives and essential infrastructure, including airports, local trains, power and telecommunication systems were all shut down. Sadly, no real lessons have been learnt.

For most part of the monsoon season this year, a significant part of India has been submerged in flood waters. Incessant rains in Gujarat, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Bengal, Odisha and Bihar have triggered floods leading often to emergency situations. Most politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have conveniently blamed climate change for floods that have impacted millions of people, paralysed local economies and caused deaths and serious economic upheavals.

India is one of the world‚Äôs most flood-prone countries with 113 million people exposed to floods. According to a UN report India‚Äôs average annual economic loss due to disasters is estimated to be $9.8 billion, out of which more than $7 billion loss is due to floods. Flooding in urban areas is a particularly challenging problem. Similar to the havoc in Mumbai, several such events have occurred in some of the major cities such as Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi, Gurugram and Bengaluru during the past decade.

Climatic impacts on urban environments demand greater scrutiny and better planning. India has failed to offer any long-term solutions. Unplanned urban growth increases risk to natural hazards like floods. In addition real estate-driven developments, poor city planning, lack of accountability of all levels of government and political neglect have left cities to the vagaries of extreme climate.

Urban ecosystems comprising marshlands, wetlands, lakes and rivers which could attenuate floods have steadily deteriorated. Encroachment and illegal construction in flood-prone areas and indiscriminate destruction of green areas have steadily reduced the resilience of cities to withstand serious flooding.

Consider Bengaluru. Once a city of 2,500 lakes, it boasted an efficient storm water drainage system of interconnected lakes. If one lake overflowed water would automatically flow to another lake. With increasing encroachment and solid wastes blocking the channels, floodwater cannot flow to the next water body, resulting in frequent inundations.

Non-functional land use planning has impacted water bodies and drainage system in other major cities like Hyderabad, which has reported extinction of 375 lakes, and Delhi, where 274 of 611 water bodies have dried up due to neglect and exploitation. Gurugram, a lowland area, has emerged as one of India‚Äôs most important industrial hubs. Many of its residential areas are still not connected to any drainage system. Thus, it is not surprising that roads in Gurugram are severely water-logged each monsoon season resulting in traffic snarls lasting up to 20 hours.

Proactive actions from municipal governments are essential to address the negative impacts of urban floods. Without strict adherence to land-use planning and construction laws, it is impossible for any city to manage its growing pressures and adequately plan its infrastructure. Not a single Indian city has a drainage system that can promptly evacuate intense monsoon rainfalls that occur over short time periods. Even these inadequate systems are never properly maintained.

In the case of Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) spent only close to 10% of its designated funds on civil infrastructure last year. Despite a budget of Rs 12,000 crore specifically allocated for development projects on roads, storm water drainage and water works, BMC did not take any initiatives to upgrade the infrastructure facilities. A report in this newspaper revealed that a large part of the BMC money amounting to Rs 61,000 crore lies in fixed deposits.

Even the funds that are used address immediate civic pressures rather than plan for long-term infrastructure creation. A similar situation exists in other major cities where the municipal corporations inflate their budgets but fail to carry out any significant developmental work.

Floods represent a major paradox. Nearly all Indian towns and cities are water-scarce in dry seasons and prone to severe flooding during monsoons. Cities like Delhi, which witness floods every monsoon, are also some of the most water-stressed in the world. This is a serious indictment of the poor state of India‚Äôs water management.

Flood waters in urban areas should be stored for use during non-monsoon seasons, both in terms of groundwater and surface storage. This is essential if expanding Indian cities are to have year-round water security and control floods. These are controllable with proper planning including functional drainage systems, storing excess of floodwater for use in dry seasons and coordinated water and land use planning. Singapore, another monsoon country, has for the most part solved urban drainage and water security problems by installing a proper and functional drainage system and then collecting all rainwater for urban use.

It is high time Indian politicians stopped blaming urban flooding on climate change and started planning for secure urban futures. As Shakespeare said ‚ÄúThe fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves, that we are underlings.‚Äù

Splurge and save now! Click here

This isn‚Äôt the first time life in Mumbai, or a sprawling urban landscape, has ground to a halt due to floods. The American state of Texas is currently flooded, in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey that hit Houston on Friday.

While the underlying cause of the flooding may be different, the factors exacerbating these disasters are similar, say experts. The tale is the same everywhere: unplanned construction, deforestation, insufficient drainage system and poor disaster response are the major culprits.

Here are five times India‚Äôs cities found themselves facing floods after a heavy deluge:

Mumbai, 2005

Mumbai is no stranger to floods. It suffers almost every other year when there is a downpour. But twelve years ago, Mumbai drowned in 944mm of rain and over 500 people died. Mumbai‚Äôs civic infrastructure crumbled under the onslaught of rain and the city was flooded, with residents wading in chest-high water. Airports were shut for 30 hours, trains were cancelled, the Mumbai-Pune Expressway was shut down and mobile networks were hit. Stranded residents sought shelter in colleges, offices and even in the homes of strangers.

The deluge is referred to ever since simply as ‚Äò26/7‚Äô in the manner of a terrorist attack.

Srinagar, 2014

In September 2014, Jammu and Kashmir‚Äôs worst floods in 60 years killed more than 200 and displaced almost a million for weeks. Major parts of the Srinagar city, including the Lal Chowk, army cantonment and Civil Lines areas were submerged. Thousands were evacuated by the army and rescue forces but many were stranded on the upper stories of their houses. All the vital roads were submerged and there was waterlogging even in the civil secretariat and Jammu and Kashmir high court. Hospitals were badly affected too.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took office that year, took an aerial survey of the flood situation and later announced a special package for the state.

Chennai, 2015

A mix of flood waters and neck-deep sewage swelled in Chennai after weeks of monsoon rains resulted in a cloudburst in November-December 2015. The floods claimed the lives of 270 in one of India‚Äôs most populous cities.

As images emerged showing people being rescued through boats, the sight of three dozen airliners with their undercarriages covered by flood waters at the Chennai international airport made people wonder if it was built in the wrong place. Mobile network and landlines too were knocked out in most of the city.

While Chennai was not unique, experts said it was worse hit than the rest of India‚Äôs southeastern seaboard because of the development boom that has gone unchecked, including rampant illegal construction.

Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, 2017

Heavy overnight rains pounded Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar in Gujarat, throwing life out of gear in July. The death toll touched at least 129 in the state devastated by heavy flooding since the monsoon rains began a month ago. Both cities recorded 7 and 8 inches of rainfall over the night, leaving public transport crippled due to waterlogged roads.

FLOODS IN RAJASTHAN: IS IT NORMAL?

This year‚Äôs intense flooding in the desert state of Rajasthan has led to an obvious question: Is climate change the culprit?

‚ÄúWhile there is evidence that climate change is causing disruptions in rainfall patterns, there is nothing unusual in the current spell of rains as similar rains had happened in the past,‚Äù explained PG Dhar Chakrabarti, former executive director, National Institute of Disaster Management.

This is because ---- and many people don‚Äôt realise this ---- flooding is not just about rainfall. Flooding is rainfall+. ‚ÄúThe rainfall+ factors include: Sudden release of large quantities of water from dams/ water reservoirs; breach/damage in major reservoirs/ dams; limited holding capacity and urbanisation,‚Äù added Dhar Chakrabarti.

The problem is that these factors are not considered for flood risk mapping, which still remains an unaccomplished task of disaster risk management experts in India.

Even the Vulnerability Atlas of India has stopped short of doing flood zonation. A task force set up by the Central Water Commission (CWC) in 2006 did not complete the task and recently an expert body has been constituted to collect data for flood risk mapping at settlement level. But thus may take time before this work is completed.

According to a report in Scroll.in, the reason behind this year‚Äôs heavy rains is this: An unusual formation of the monsoon trough, an area of low pressure, has generated intense rainfall. Low-pressure regions develop frequently over the Bay of Bengal and move West or North West, drawing rain to the northern regions of the country. This year, the pattern has been different, with two separate depressions present at the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal at the same time.

CAN WE MINIMISE FLOOD DESTRUCTION?

Flood-related destruction can only be minimised only if flood forecasting is accurate.

Unfortunately, like flood risk mapping, India fails miserably on this score too.

The Comptroller and Auditor General‚Äôs recent report said a majority of India‚Äôs flood forecast systems have either been washed away or their parts have been stolen. ‚ÄúNearly 60% of the 375 telemetry stations set up between 1997 and 2016 are non-operational which defeats the purpose of investing in the modernisation of flood forecast network.

The issue of investing in better flood forecasting policy has also been raised in water policy expert and former plan panel member Mihir Shah‚Äôs report to the government on ‚ÄúA 21st Century Institutional Architecture for India‚Äôs Water Reforms‚Äù.

‚ÄúIn addressing the problem of floods, the central focus over the years has been on engineering/structural solutions. Apart from the massive investments in large dams, India has already constructed over 35,000 km of embankments. But these are rapidly reaching their limits... Instead, [India needs better weather and flood forecasting is required, along with flood insurance and possibly the designation of flood diversion areas...‚Äù.

It goes on to add that the existing flood forecasting network of the CWC is not sufficient to cover the country adequately and that there is an urgent need for the extension of the organisation‚Äôs flood forecasting network in consultation with states and India Meteorological Department to cover non-metros.

‚ÄúThe lead-time for flood forecasting can be improved through the use of hydraulic and hydrologic models which are linked to the weather forecasting system, the real time data acquisition system, and the reservoir operation system. It‚Äôs possible to improve the current forecasting methods by using satellite-based information for better estimates of rainfall and snowmelt,‚Äù it adds.

Experts also point out that Bangladesh has better forecasting capabilities than India. Its Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre website gives a good idea about the rivers and the forecasting sites. The home page also provides information on the sites where water level is currently on the rise or above the danger mark.

The choice for India is obvious but snail‚Äôs pace progress in setting up these critical forecasting systems is only leaving the administration at the local level without any advance warning to prepare for the surge of the rivers.

The River Yamuna travels some 52 km through the NCT of Delhi. It enters near village Palla and exits at village Jaitpur. Ranging from 800 m to 3 km in width, the Yamuna flood plain in Delhi ‚Äì constituting the DDA‚Äôs Zone O ‚Äì is spread, on paper, over 9,700 ha. But a closer look tells a different story.

Slowly but steadily the flood plains have been gnawed at both by the people and State agencies. The result is unauthorised settlements mushrooming all over the flood plain; and state-created or sponsored structures like power utilities, metro complexes, bus depots, crematoria, games village and stadiums, samadhies and cultural cum temple complexes standing well within Zone O. One of the little appreciated but hugely harmful structures have been the pseudo bridges (bridge that span just the lean season flow with approach roads standing as cross embankment in the floodplains) that have straight jacketed the river and badly fragmented the flood plain. Fortunately due to a sensible direction in 2014 by the Yamuna Standing Committee, the river and the city might not suffer anymore of these pseudo bridges!

It is a strange irony that despite a well adjudicated and non adversarial judicial intervention made on 13 January 2015 by the NGT in form of ‚ÄúMaily se Nirmal Yamuna Restoration Project 2017‚Äù the city is still to witness any notable movement on the restoration of its flood plain. What use is an unimplemented plan, however sound?

There is little time to lose and the litmus test of the state‚Äôs ability to reverse the brazen and insidious encroachment taking place well into the active flood plain shall be in the Jaitpur area where encroachers are making merry while State agencies remain undecided on who should bell the cat.

Interestingly it is not that nothing is happening on the river front. New plans and ideas for the river ranging from sensible (rejuvenation of the Najafgarh drain) to bizarre (water taxi plans and the idea of a landfill in the flood plain) keep emerging from time to time.

A recent NGT-directed hydrodynamic simulation of the Yamuna flood plain carried out by IIT Delhi presents a horrifying scenario. Looking at the past 25 year flood scenario and where the water will spread, it warns city managers against any lethargy in halting and reversing flood plain encroachments. Imagine what the city would witness if floods of the intensity of 100 or 500 year (not unlikely in times of rapid climate change) were to visit it?

New Delhi: A new study has pointed out that flooding in polluted rivers has the potential to make groundwater unsafe for human use.

In December 2015, when Chennai was flooded and people were marooned, a team of scientists from Anna University was collecting groundwater samples along the Adyar river to investigate if the groundwater in this region was fit for human consumption.

Researchers collected water samples from 17 locations in December 2015 and April 2016 (i.e. during and after the floods). They tested the samples for salt and heavy-metal concentrations, the microbial load and their susceptibility to available antibiotics.

‚ÄúWe wanted to know if the city water met water quality parameters laid down by the Bureau of Indian Standards during and post-flood,‚Äù Lakshmanan Elango, a professor at the department of geology at Anna University and the leader of this study, told India Science Wire.

The results showed that the heavy-metal concentration and microbial load in groundwater samples were high. The samples contained microbes such as Enterobacter, Staphylococcus, Escherichia, Streptococcus, Vibrio and Salmonella ‚Äì known to cause infections like dysentery, cholera and typhoid in humans. These microbes were cultured with various antibiotics used in clinical practice to treat life-threatening infections, to find out if they were susceptible or resistant to drugs.

‚ÄúThe bacteria were sensitive to most antibiotics but some were resistant to nalidixic acid, which is alarming as antibiotic resistance can rapidly spread in the environment,‚Äù Elango said. Nalidixic acid is a synthetic antibiotic used to inhibit the growth of, or kill off, gram-negative bacteria. The results of the study were published in the journal Scientific Data on October 10, 2017.

Additionally, scientists found a high level genetic similarities between bacteria from various locations, implying that they must have originated from a single domestic sewage source containing faecal matter. ‚ÄúSewage must have washed off with flood water, which in turn inundates the wells that would have resulted in contaminating the groundwater,‚Äù Elango explained.

‚ÄúOur findings show that floods have the potential to impact the microbial quality of groundwater in affected areas. Based on our study, we advise that wells must be chlorinated and the public must be warned to avoid consuming groundwater for drinking, at least for some months post floods.‚Äù

The study was conducted together with the University of Zululand in South Africa and the National University of Singapore, and was funded by India‚Äôs Department of Science and Technology.

delhi,2017,https://thewire.in/environment/heavy-flooding-casualties-raise-questions-indias-disaster-preparedness,03-Aug-17,Heavy Flooding and Casualties Raise Questions on India's Disaster Preparedness,"New Delhi: With floods claiming hundreds of lives across India this year, with maximum damage being reported from the two BJP ruled states of Assam and Gujarat, the disaster mitigation and response mechanism of the Narendra Modi government has once again come into question.

The prime minister, who heads the National Disaster Management Authority, had last year released India‚Äôs first ever National Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) that sought to make the country more disaster resilient and reduce the loss of lives. But three year into the government, Modi‚Äôs recent visit to the Northeast in the wake of massive loss of lives and property due to floods has indicated that the plans have failed to deliver when it mattered most.

Though the NDMP covers all aspects of disaster management, right from prevention, mitigation and response to recovery, and provides for coordination at all levels by spelling out the roles and responsibilities of everyone from the panchayat level to the Centre, experts insist that lack of coordination and inadequate training at the ground level remain the biggest challenges in mitigating losses. The suggested emphasis on information, education and communication activities is also yet to be adequately acted upon.

It is for this reason that the prime minister felt the need to form a seven-member team to do an on-ground assessment of the situation in Assam. Had the NDMP been implemented properly, such a need would not have arisen, experts say.

During his visit to the state, Modi announced a relief package which was in keeping with the decades-long practice of premiers paying visits to flood-affected states and announcing relief measures after damage has been done. The only marked departure lay in his announcing a Rs 100 crore corpus for studying the Brahmaputra for suggesting remedies to tackle floods.

The issue of the floods claiming several hundred lives and displacing lakhs was also raised by leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, recently when he had accused the Modi government of ‚Äúsleeping over‚Äù the human tragedy. Azad had insisted that over a crore people had been impacted, over 1,40,000 displaced and hundreds had been killed. The response of the government was found to be abysmal, he said.

The Modi government will have to shoulder the burden for the way in which the disaster response mechanism has failed the people. It was way back in 2005, soon after a devastating tsunami had struck the eastern coasts of India, that the Centre had mooted setting up a national disaster management authority. Subsequently, the NDMA was constituted to ‚Äúspearhead and implement a holistic and integrated approach to Disaster Management in India‚Äù.

Trouble right under prime minister‚Äôs nose

Performance of the NDMA, headed directly by the prime minister, eaves much to be desired. Its website does not have any information on the current floods apart from an ‚Äòalert‚Äô ticker giving out weather-related updates. There is no mention of the current floods under the head of ‚Äúnatural disasters‚Äù and ‚Äúfloods‚Äù in the ‚Äúmedia and public awareness‚Äù section.

According to experts, the NDMA is also suffering because of an ongoing tussle between some members and senior office-bearers. ‚ÄúThere is no internal synergy in the organisation and it just conducts meetings to show that it is indeed working,‚Äù said a former consultant.

The Delhi high court had in July pulled up the Centre for not filling up the vacant posts in both the NDMA and National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM). It had said, ‚Äúif the posts are unnecessary, delete them‚Äù. Former NDMA vice-chairman M. Shashidhar Reddy and five of other members had to resign after the Modi government asked them to quit their posts soon after assuming office in 2014.

The situation at the NIDM, which is supposed to provide training and comes under the Ministry of Home Affairs, is hardly any better. Its website is no better when it comes to the dissemination of information and the last updates on ‚Äúrecent activities‚Äù date back to April and pertain to some events conducted by the institute.

All of this is reflective of the fact that not only has the approach towards disaster mitigation and management not changed in the last 12 years, it has also not improved in the Modi era.

The impact has been borne by people in the prime minister‚Äôs own state of Gujarat as well, where over 200 deaths have been reported.

Why such high casualty numbers?

The question that arises is why, when India uses state-of-the-art satellites and local stations for weather forecasting, and when there is the pre-deployment of teams along hazard zones identified through mapping and marking, are the casualty numbers so alarmingly high.

According to a disaster management expert who preferred not to be named, the crux of the problem is the lack of coordination between the Centre and state governments, especially when the government in the state does not belong to the party ruling at the Centre. The Supreme Court had in May also flagged this issue. However, as the cases of Assam and Gujarat indicate, the frictions of the past often leave their mark in the future as well, as systems are not put in place to tackle exigencies.

The expert said there is also a large gap between theoretical knowledge which is shared in conferences and the trainings at the ground level. ‚ÄúIt is an ad hoc arrangement. Lakhs are spent on seminars and workshops every year and all parties concerned insist that there has been a ‚Äòparadigm shift‚Äô from a relief-centric to a mitigation-centric or preparedness-centric approach. But in reality this is not the case and we continue to be in the relief-centric mode.‚Äù

At the grassroots or panchayat and block level, things have not changed, the expert said. ‚ÄúPeople are not aware about what to do or not to do. Capacity has not been built due to the lack of trainers. And why are the quality trainers not there? That is so because they are not appointed properly, not paid proper honorariums and in most cases their appointments are also ad hoc.‚Äù

In the NIDM, the expert said, no faculty has been appointed for the last ten years. In the case before the Delhi high court, the petitioner, advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, had pointed out that due to vacancies, the NIDM not being able to conduct various trainings.

Deployment of teams not proper

In the event of floods, the expert said, a lot of lives are lost as timely aid is not able to reach them on time. This happens because while the inundation mapping and the hazard zonation mapping is done, there is no one to understand and use them on the ground. ‚ÄúIn a flood-prone area, how are people on the ground to run the programme to minimise casualties when they are not even trained for it? For this they have to be up to date in relief management, resource management, mitigation planning and preparedness planning, but they do not even possess the basic skill to understand these,‚Äù he said.

Stating that there is no one to teach these grassroots-level officers, the expert said while there is a dearth of professional trainers, the senior police and state administration officers who are trained in these subjects do not transfer technology or disseminate information to the lower-level officials. ‚ÄúThey do not impart their skills to others. So training is a mere lip-service at the grassroots level,‚Äù the expert said.

Floods becoming highly erratic

What has compounded problems is the increasingly erratic nature of weather and consequently flooding. The expert said that in the past few years, the nature of floods is changing. ‚ÄúPlaces which did not witness floods last year are witnessing massive flooding this time and many places prone to flooding have not witnessed floods of the scale they are used to. So while flood zoning does happen, we are unable to respond adequately,‚Äù he said.

The threat of urban flooding is also increasing due to the changing rainfall pattern. Two recent examples of such floods have been those in Mumbai in 2006 and Chennai in 2015.

Incidentally, following these floods workshops were conducted and an expert group was constituted by the NDMA to tackle the problem on an immediate basis (by 2020), medium term (2025) and long-term basis (by 2030). A ten-point strategy was also devised for the immediate term and the plan was sent to the states for their inputs.

Not using technology on forecasting correctly

The expert said forecasting and early warning signs are dependent on the Indian Meteorological Department. ‚ÄúOnce the IMD issues a forecast, the Centre reacts and sounds out the state governments. But by the time they respond, it is generally too late. The time lag is huge,‚Äù he said.

Also, the warnings are dependent on the IMD alone and data from other weather forecasting agencies is not considered.

The expert said the weather forecasters are at the moment modifying global weather or precipitation models to arrive at outcomes to provide local weather forecasts. In this conversion or customisation of data, the error in accuracy creeps in. But with latest satellite-based inputs which are available to us in India, we can easily make the short-term forecasting over 95% accurate, he said.

The IMD now has Doppler Radars that gather information on total rainfall, direction and speed of rain, and storms. The use of their data along with satellite imagery can really make a difference in weather forecasting for disaster preparedness. The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) under the Indian Space Research Organisation has already prepared a flood atlas for several states like Assam, Bihar, West Bengal, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh, and using inundation maps these provide details of areas that are prone to being submerged when river waters rise.

But, as the expert said, we have not been able to use the available advanced technology adequately. Early preparedness planning through these forecasting tools needs to be enhanced.

Have a separate ministry for disaster management

A separate ministry for disaster management could be an answer to some of these problems and improve synergy among different groups. As the expert said, as of now the Central Water Commission under the Ministry of Water Resources is responsible for floods and the Ministry of Urban Development is responsible for urban flooding. The NIDM and NDMA, meanwhile, come under the Ministry of Home Affairs.

‚ÄúBut MoUD is not doing anything in urban flooding. They just issue the guidelines and their work ends there. Despite repeated reminders from the NDMA, it has done nothing. Even in their Urban Flooding Cell, they have not even appointed a nodal officer to look at the problem of urban flooding,‚Äù he said.

As for the the CWC, he said, its functioning is no better. ‚ÄúThere has been no appraisal ever of its functioning. All that it does is say the flood level is so and so at such places. This goes on till around September and thereafter they shut down that information system. This is why a separate ministry is needed to oversee the entire operations.‚Äù

The expert said weather forecasting needs to be improved for providing early warnings to state administrations and rescue and relief agencies in times of natural disasters. ‚ÄúSo we need good synergy between the private and government forecasting agencies. If the advanced warning system is strengthened, you will be able to reduce casualties even if the response capacity is limited. You will be able to warn people about weather conditions three or four days ahead with greater precision and they would be able to evacuate on time.‚Äù

There is also a need for periodical evaluation of capacity building. ‚ÄúWe need to know if what is being taught is adequate, if it is actually required and if it is of the desired quality. Working on these aspects would provide instant results,‚Äù he said. And finally, a dedicated television channel for providing detailed information to affected residents in the event of an impending or ongoing disaster is needed, he concluded.",issue,2019 North Indian floods,North India,"June 15, 2019","August 15, 2019","Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha",100-200 mm,$10 billion,"1,200+",1.2 million people displaced,India's worst floods in decades,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

All these trains were to originate on Tuesday and most from the north-east and New Delhi were to pass through Bihar on Wednesday.

A total of 509 trains, either originating or passing through ECR, have so far been cancelled between August 13 and 29 due to floods.

‚ÄúTill August 26, ECR‚Äôs loss has been Rs 26.60 crore due to infrastructure damage of railway property, while more than Rs 20 crore has been lost in passenger revenue due to cancellation of trains on account of floods.

Passenger safety being of paramount importance, the railways is keeping a close vigil of tracks and bridges at vulnerable locations.

-DK Gayen, general manager, ECR

He said Samastipur was the worst affected railway division. ‚ÄúTrain services between Samastipur and Darbhanga have been stopped since August 19, as Bagmati water level has crossed the danger mark at bridge number 16 between Hayaghat and Thalwara stations. Train operation on this bridge has become unsafe, as piers are no longer visible and river water has touched the bottom of the bridge girder due to unexpected rise in Bagmati water level.‚Äù

The problem was further compounded on August 23 when another bridge (number 1) on Burhi Gandak river became unsafe due to rise in water level, he added.

Gayen said a couple of ongoing projects, including the gauge conversion of Raxaul-Narkatiganj section and the laying of new railway line between Biraul and Harnagar, would be delayed by 3-4 months due to floods.

He also said that it could take a few months for full restoration of train services.

On post flood safety, Gayen said the railways was keeping a close vigil of tracks and bridges at vulnerable locations, as passenger safety was of paramount importance.

Bihar floods, which have claimed 514 lives so far, showed signs of improvement, with water levels in all major rivers going down.

Principal secretary, Disaster Management Department, Pratyaya Amrit, said Kishanganj, Araria and Purnea districts were free of flood water, while Katihar was still partially affected. ‚ÄúRestoration work in these areas are on we will stop distribution of food packets in panchayats of these areas in the next couple of days,‚Äù he added.

If you stay there long enough, the stink seems to acquire stifling proportions in the 40 degree-plus temperature.

In the midst of this strip of fetid wasteland is located a rag-tag cluster of tenements inhabited by a several hundred people, including families with children. At some remove, there is a tiny temple, the only brick-and-mortar structure in the shanty ‚Äî erected probably in the hope of divine redemption.

This slum, like all such located on the Yamuna floodplains, is vulnerable to submergence nearly every monsoon.

""Last time it (Yamuna) flooded was in 2013. We had to move up the 'pushta' (the stone embankment) and stay there for days until the water receded‚Ä¶ Although during rainy season the water comes very near and submerges the nearest huts, it comes to flooding only in about three-four years,"" said Radheshyam, who has been living in Shastri Nagar Metro Depot Yamuna Khadar slums for 8-9 years, after he was shifted from a different slum which was razed in the run-up to the 2010 Commonwealth Games.

Coming from Gonda district in Uttar Pradesh to the capital in the hope of better means of livelihood, Radheshyam says that although he earns Rs. 300 or about every day, his condition is just as precarious.

""The government gives us nominal services‚Äì like a water tanker every day ‚Äî but no permanency. There are 1,265 voters in these slums, but they are not good enough to be located at a better place,"" he adds resignedly.

The seasonal flooding poses a graver concern at the slums located on the other side of the road along the narrow river stretch where most of dwellers identify themselves as farmers.

""The rains don't affect us much but the floods ruin everything that we grow, which is mainly vegetables,"" says Ismail from Kisan Colony Yamuna Khadar, who has been living in the same slum since 1981 and runs an NGO there.

""We are farmers and almost everyone here is a Muslim. When the river flooded a few years back we were rushed up on the 'pushta'. We squatted there for 20 or so days before coming down and took stock of the mess,"" he says before showing off a madrassa (Islamic seminary) where ""kids study and adults go to pray"".

Asked how they prepare against such contingencies as floods, Ismail dismissed the question with a fatalistic shrug, saying they do nothing as there's nothing that can be done.

""A couple of years back government officials came and said that Yamuna is going to be cleaned up. They asked us to grow vegetables at our own risks since that can be destroyed whenever the cleaning starts.

""No one has come yet for the cleaning, it has been two years. But farming requires a lot of investment and I cannot risk that much money,"" he said.

A pair of girls smiled shyly when asked about their condition during floods. They said they just go ""up the pushta"".

The slum-dwellers, it was revealed, are not wholly on their own against floods. The local authorities also do their bit and provide for the shelter, sometimes food, and money, at least last time, to rebuild shanties.

""The police come to tell us two-three days before to evacuate,"" says Ismail, who now makes do by selling vegetables off-cart unlike before when he would sell them wholesale in the market.

Experts claim that the danger of floods has been on the increase with the rise of structures being built on the floodplains of the river.

The Art of Living festival last year on the flood plains was criticised by environmentalists and Yamuna conservation activists who had argued that the festival would harm the plains' capability of holding soil and recharging groundwater, leading to more frequent floods.

However, faced with a chronic threat, these slum-dwellers bear nature's annual challenge with remarkable fortitude and have learnt to live with it in the absence of any viable alternative.

The banality of even such grave poverty was manifest in Radheshyam's comments when, visibly tired of talking about floods, he said: ""The biggest problem is mosquitoes, they don't let me sleep in night.""",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

What happened in Mumbai on August 29 was criminal. Thirty centimetres of rainfall in a day drowned a city celebrated as India‚Äôs financial capital and with a civic body with a budget larger than many small states. Lakhs of people were stranded at railway stations or their workplaces or spent the night wading home through flooded roads. As the sun rose heralding a new day, it brought to light fresh horror. Scores of people, most of them aged men and women, were missing. One man seems to have fallen into an open manhole and drowned. His umbrella was found floating nearby.

2. Why floods are the new normal this monsoon Sunita Narain

The Indian monsoon is never really ‚Äònormal‚Äô. It rains too much or too little. It is variable and more than often unpredictable.This year, even as 40% of the districts in India face prospects of drought, close to 25% districts have had heavy rainfall of more than 100 mm in just a matter of hours. This means we must learn more about how to mitigate floods and how to live with scarcity of water. But the good news is that doing one can help the other.

3. Why Chandigarh, India‚Äôs best planned city, went under after three hours of rain Ramesh Vinayak

Natural mishaps have an uncanny way to expose all that is wrong with India‚Äôs urban planning and infrastructure. The unusually heavy rains on August 21 ‚Äì the heaviest in 16 years ‚Äì starkly did that reality check at an unlikeliest of places: Chandigarh, the country‚Äôs first and, arguably the most, well-planned city since Independence. A 115-mm downpour in just three hours morphed the much-acclaimed ‚ÄòCity Beautiful‚Äô into an ugly chaos that its denizens had scarcely ever imagined.

4. Why Chennai - like other Indian cities - will definitely flood again Nityanand Jayaraman

What Chennai does to the Kosasthalaiyar river and the Ennore Creek will decide whether the city will survive or succumb with the next above-average rains.Mumbai went under water last week; Chandigarh the week before, and Agartala, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad earlier on during this southwest monsoon. The jury is out on whether the extreme rain events were caused by climate change. But there is little doubt that detrimental land-use change played a big part in turning the rains to floods. Heavy, erratic and extreme rainfall is now unavoidable. But what are we doing to protect ourselves and make our cities less flood prone?

5. Why India is failing to minimise monsoon flood destruction Kumkum Dasgupta

In India, floods are a common occurrence every monsoon. This year the situation is dire in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Assam, Bengal and Manipur. According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), on an average every year, 75 lakh hectare of land is affected, 1,600 lives are lost and the damage caused to crops, houses and public utilities due to floods is worth Rs 1,805 crore. To date, the maximum number of lives (11,316) was lost in 1977. The frequency of major floods is more than once in five years.

delhi,2017,https://thewire.in/environment/kaziranga-rhinos-assam-brahmaputra-flood,29-Aug-17,"The Rhinos of Kaziranga, Floods of the Brahmaputra, and the Politics of Assam","Neha Sinha is a Delhi-based conservationist.

A rhino floundering through flood water, nostrils and eyes just visible over the flood line, has become an iconic symbol of Kaziranga. Each year, the Brahmaputra river floods during the monsoon, inundating the state of Assam. People are displaced, wildlife scatters and infrastructure is destroyed. Yet the flood has a unique relationship to Kaziranga National Park.

The park is in the Brahmaputra floodplain and is a mosaic of forest, wet grasslands, riparian areas and wetlands. Flooding is essential for the area. In fact, it has shaped the ecosystem. For example, flooding creates exchanges in nutrients and fish between wetlands and the river and silt deposition regenerates the plain. But another unique thing about this national park ‚Äì shaped by nature but demarcated by the political and administrative human hand ‚Äì is the way its wild animals are characterised.

Each year, dedicated teams from forest departments and NGOs rescue scores of animals from the floods in the Kaziranga landscape. While natural disasters generally have unknown or unquantified tolls on wild animals and nature, Kaziranga‚Äôs abiding efforts to save its wildlife is both unique and sustained. It grants a degree of citizenship to the animals. Traditionally, human interventions in sanctuaries for wild animals have been looked down upon. The late Machali, Ranthambhore‚Äôs tigress ‚Äì also known as the most photographed tigress in the world ‚Äì was kept alive through frequent capture and medical interventions, which evinced its fair share of criticism. Machali was so familiar that she was granted personhood. When she died, she was given a state-sponsored funeral, dying more as a Great Lady than as a tigress.

In Kaziranga‚Äôs inhospitable, mosquito-ridden, leech-inflamed terrain, wild denizens ‚Äì rhinos, elephants, hog deer, swamp deer, tigers, wild buffalo and many more ‚Äì are treated as inherently wild until the flood arrives. Then it appears that the gap collapses between wild and dangerous, and between the familiar and those needing help. Rescuers brave life and limb to save and also rehabilitate these wild animals, with admirable determination and resilience. While we have an understanding of loss to human and life and property, amazingly, such a roster also exists for Kaziranga‚Äôs animals.

A study using satellite images of the annual flooding in Assam between June and July 2012 revealed that ‚Äú4.65 lakh hectares was submerged, 3,829 villages marooned, and 23.08 lakh people were affected‚Äù. In 2017, 144 people were reported to have died in Assam. This year, more than 140 animals, including seven rhinos, 122 swamp deer and two elephants (known, incidentally, to be excellent swimmers) have died. Several others also have been rescued this year. But key questions remain unanswered.

One, the Kaziranga flood shows that landscape ecology needs to be privileged over just protected area boundaries. While the park itself is in a low-lying area, wild animals need to move to higher ground. The adjoining and higher Karbi Anglong hills are a traditional dispersal and sheltering area during floods. However, there are a host of growing disturbances between the actual (and well-protected) national park and increasingly disturbed surrounding areas. In the immediate landscape, quarrying permissions have been granted, cars speed and brick kilns have operated. Further, similar to many other protected areas, human settlements are expanding. Not only are animal migration corridors being cut (the animals usually reach Karbi Anglong hills only after crossing a highway), highlands have also been taken over by people. However, unlike in other parks, the issue of ‚Äòencroachment‚Äô is problematised and framed as an illegal, foreign act.

It has been alleged that ‚Äòencroachers‚Äô in the national park are illegal and Bangladeshi both, a charge that is only likely to be more flammable under the political current regime, which has a hardline policy against Bangladeshi settlers. The cracks are deep. In an eviction drive last year, two people died in clashes with the police. What this confrontational politics will mean for the future of panicked and dispersing animals is unclear. Will people, already in conflict with the authorities, find themselves at the centre of more profound human-wildlife conflict? Will the animosity clear the area of settlers, only to make way for more grandiose development schemes? Or will the area be safeguarded from human disturbances?

Two, while the flood is a natural phenomenon, it is difficult to say how climate change will further impact rainfall and flooding. One of the ways out, say many people connected to field conservation in Kaziranga, is to artificially create more highlands and islands for the animals to seek refuge in. If the impacts of floods are getting exacerbated by humans ‚Äì such as human-made obstructions for wild animal dispersal as well as disturbances to river flow ‚Äì then human engineering providing an answer is only fair, many argue.

Three, while Kaziranga is a national park and a centre for amazing biodiversity, it is also an important route of commerce. National highway #37 goes through the park, with a steady stream of both commercial and private vehicles that cause both death and disturbance to wildlife. The National Green Tribunal has been listening to the matter of disturbance and illegal construction within the park and its eco-sensitive zone. On the tribunal‚Äôs orders, speed sensors and interceptor vehicles have been deployed to monitor vehicles.

Now that the floods are receding, animals will be moving back inside the park and are in a particularly vulnerable position. In the early spate of floods, many animals are killed on the highway every year (apart from in other collisions throughout the year). This July, of 81 animals killed, 13 died on the highway after being hit by cars. Many suggest that at least during the flood and its aftermath, the highway should be completely shut down. It is well established that roads have a severe impact on species‚Äîcausing not just death but also disturbance, and an aid to poaching. Despite regular accidents, there are plans to expand this highway.

The flood comes each year. Despite the forest department‚Äôs best efforts, wildlife dies each year, sometimes flooded and drowned, often commercially poached. But while many other animals might die anonymous and unmourned deaths, Kaziranga‚Äôs unique story sometimes grants its own some space in a government roster, sometimes even a second life.

If the wild animal is a conscionable entity, then this is problematised by the fact that though a flood can be seen as an ‚Äòact of god‚Äô, human activity certainly is not. If people continue to block refuge and highways are further expanded, then acts of god become more cruel and, irreversibly, more anthropogenic.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

They said that steps such as rainwater harvesting, ban on use of plastic bags and better use of weather forecasts will go a long way in helping tackle flooding in cities after rains.

Heavy downpours have been disrupting normal life in almost all metro cities in India, with Mumbai bearing the brunt last month which led to death of at least six persons.

Experts said a range of factors including rapid migration to urban areas and ""lackadaisical attitude"" of civic authorities were among the factors that contribute to cities coming to a standstill after heavy rains.

They said citizens also have to behave responsibly and ensure that plastic bags or used food plates are not thrown in the open or in the neighbourhood drains.

V.K. Sharma, Senior Professor of Disaster Management at the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA), said the cities need a proper system of garbage collection and sewage disposal and regular cleaning of drains.

""It is true that poor drainage and sewage system is the real cause of urban flooding. There is also migration to cities which often leads to land encroachment and exerts pressure on the existing civic infrastructure,"" Sharma told IANS.

Sharma said the urban planning has to have a long-term perspective and infrastructure should keep pace with growth of population. He said rain water harvesting should be made mandatory.

""There is also the need of fixing accountability of government officials and municipal authorities if drains are not properly cleaned. Strict penalties should be imposed on people throwing garbage in the open,"" he said.

He said steps have been taken at some places to ban use of plastic bag but it should be enforced strictly.

""There is need to make people aware. This will also meet the larger goal of cleanliness,"" he said.

Sharma said that prediction of the meteorological department are fairly accurate and authorities can issue timely alerts to people in case there is prediction of very heavy rainfall.

""This will also help prevent loss of life,"" he said.

Santosh Kumar, a professor at the National Institute of Disaster Management with expertise in disaster risk reduction and policy planning, said climate change was also a factor in cities getting excessive rainfall.

""Urban flooding occurs when water flows into an urban region faster than it can be absorbed into the soil. Earlier, a city received such amount of rainfall in two to three weeks,"" Kumar said, referring to Mumbai getting 350 mm rainfall on August 29-30.

He said the cities do not have spaces to absorb the excess water or to store it.

""Rapid urbanisation, industrialisation and population growth have also contributed to drainage systems getting congested. These drains are not able to take the pressure of huge water accumulated due to heavy rain, leading to waterlogging,"" Kumar told IANS.

He said steps should be taken to improve garbage disposal and ensure that plastics do not find their way to drains.

""Urban ecosystems comprising marshlands, wetlands, lakes and rivers have steadily deteriorated,"" Kumar added.

Vinod Kumar Jain, director of NGO Tapas which works in revival of water bodies in Delhi, said ""water harvesting can play a significant role in reducing the chances of flooding in urban areas.""

Rainwater harvesting refers to trapping and storing rainwater so that it can be used at a later time when the need arises.

Heavy rainfall in Delhi last month had flooded roads and caused huge traffic snarls. On August 19, many parts of Chandigarh were flooded due to heavy rains. Chennai had witnessed severe flooding in 2015 while floods in Mumbai in 2005 had killed over 500 people.

The extreme El Nino conditions in 2015 and the warming trend in the Bay of Bengal contributed equally to the unprecedented heavy rainfall witnessed in Chennai for three days from November 30 to December 2, 2015, researchers have found.

El Nino generally causes less than normal rainfall in the case of the southwest monsoon. In contrast, it brings about above-normal rainfall during the northeast monsoon. This is because of the difference in seasonal wind patterns between the two monsoons.

A study by the University of Hyderabad and the Indian Institute of Technology ‚Äì Bombay suggests that the extreme El Nino that occurred in 2015 played an important role in Chennai‚Äôs heavy rainfall. After 1982 and 1997, the 2015 event also turned out to be an extreme El Nino event.

‚ÄúAnother factor that seems to have played an important role is the consistent warming of the Bay of Bengal off the coast of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh,‚Äù says Dr. Karumuri Ashok from the Centre for Earth and Space Sciences, University of Hyderabad, and the corresponding author of the paper published in the journal Climate Dynamics .

A simple linear correlation analysis carried out by the authors indicates that the Bay of Bengal sea surface temperature positively and significantly correlated with northeast monsoon rainfall.

The magnitude of correlations of northeast monsoon rainfall with El Nino conditions and the Bay of Bengal warming are nearly similar.

‚ÄúBased on sensitivity experiments we could conjuncture that about 21% of the intensity of the extreme Chennai rainfall can be attributed to the extreme El Nino conditions,‚Äù Dr. Ashok says. ‚ÄúInterestingly, the warming trend in the Bay of Bengal [sea surface temperature] contributed equally to the Chennai event.‚Äù

El Nino can affect the Indian monsoon through atmospheric circulation. Whenever the El Nino signal shows up in atmospheric circulation, the local sea surface temperature can also change.

‚ÄúExperiments suggest that changes in local sea surface temperature seem to be stronger than local atmospheric changes,‚Äù Dr. Ashok says. He however cautions that these results have been arrived using just one dynamical model. ‚ÄúWe need to confirm if this result is correct. So we need to repeat using more cases with the same model and similar type of studies using other numerical models,‚Äù he says.

It remains to be seen if this kind of contribution from the tropical Pacific to extreme rainfall during the northeast monsoon happens only during extreme El Nino or whether normal El Ninos too can cause it.

‚ÄúThis is important because the El Nino itself is changing,‚Äù Dr. Ashok says.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nan

It HAS been five days since the Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad went under water following incessant rainfall in the city that led to swelling of the river. The 11.25 km-long riverfront was developed not only as an urban asset, but also to help control flood. But the release of around 1.28 lakh cusecs of water from Dharoi dam led to the flooding of the riverfront last week. This was not the first time that the riverfront got flooded. In the past too, the lower promenade of the riverfront got submerged thrice ‚Äî in 2006, 2011 and 2015. In 2015, the release of 1.8 lakh cusecs of water from Dharoi dam had led to the flooding of the riverfront.

This time, as water level in the river rose between July 25 and 26, around 135 snakes made their way from the riverfront to the nearby areas, leading to a scare. Some snakes found their way into various factories in Behrampura. ‚ÄúThe snake holes are near the water. So when the water is released from the dam and the river swells up, the snakes are forced to leave their holes for safer places. This will happen every time the riverfront gets flooded.

In the first week of December 2015, Chennai saw unprecedented flooding as a result of heavy rainfall. Citizens banded together to rescue others stranded in their homes as the water levels rose to alarming levels. We take a look some scenes from the floods that devastated many lives and caused untold destruction to properties.

The storm brought life to a standstill and almost everyone experienced some kind of loss. Thousands were left homeless and vulnerable, at the mercy of the weather and the charity of good samaritans.

The lack of warning of the floods in Chennai made it especially difficult for people with disabilities, who were left to fend for themselves. While some needed rescuing , others lost essential implements like hearing aids, crutches and calipers, leaving them more vulnerable than ever before.

Across the city, people found pets lost on the roads . In many cases, they were washed away, or ran out when the water started rising. Many were rescued by the SPCA and the animal rescue volunteers.

Though cyclones, depressions and storms are an annual occurrence in Chennai, some years like 1985, when former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran was evacuated from his Ramapuram garden home, or 1976, when the Army stepped in to keep the Manali oil refinery running, are unforgettable.

Chembarambakkam Lake, which is blamed for the city‚Äôs flooding, was once the lifeline of South Chennai as it irrigated 168 villages in the district while the North of Chennai benefited from Puzhal Lake. However, plundering of the waterbodies, including the lake, led to the uprooting of livelihoods and homes over a vast area.

Fishermen from Kovalam and Semmanchery helped people reach Kovalam and Kelambakkam after a portion of the road connecting these two places was washed away by the floods.

Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal termed the second wave of deluge since July as the ‚Äúworst floods in decades‚Äù. The first wave had claimed 84 lives in Assam and another 62 across Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland between May and July.

With Saturday‚Äôs casualties, the death toll since May has touched 161.

In an emergency meeting on Sunday, the Assam government asked the Army to get involved in rescue and relief operations and put Indian Air Force choppers on standby.

Additional personnel of national and state disaster response forces were deployed in the affected districts to rescue marooned people.

According to Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), more than 1.83 lakh people displaced in the recent floods are taking shelter in 678 relief camps across the state.

The Brahmaputra is flowing above the danger level at Neematighat, Tezpur, Guwahati, Goalpara and Dhubri. Ten other rivers across the state are also flowing above the red mark at one place each.

‚ÄúFlood waters have submerged 2,734 villages and more than 1.34 lakh hectare of crop area affected. Erosion and breaches of embankments have been reported in 11 districts,‚Äù an ASDMA officer said.

Parts of the national highway 37 connecting western and eastern Assam got submerged at Jakhalabandha, 175 km east of Guwahati, on Sunday morning disrupting movement of vehicles for several hours.

Rail link between northeast and the rest of the country also snapped on Sunday after railway tracks got submerged or damaged at several places in Assam and West Bengal due to flooding.

‚ÄúA number of trains had to be stopped at various stations, and many other trains had to be cancelled or rescheduled or short-terminated,‚Äù Pranav Jyoti Sharma, spokesperson of Northeast Frontier Railway said.

Railway authorities cancelled 20 trains on Sunday causing distress to thousands of passengers.

Defence spokesperson Lt Col Suneet Newton said army personnel rescued some 3,000 marooned people in western and central Assam districts.

BJP flood helpline in Tripura

Tripura chief minister Manik Sarkar and revenue minister Badal Choudhury visited flood-prone areas on the banks of river Howrah on Saturday and ordered officials to monitor the situation. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, was not convinced with the efforts of the Left Front government.

The BJP accused the Sarkar government of selectively providing relief materials to flood victims in camps run by CPI(M) cadre. It also announced a 24x7 flood helpline.

‚ÄúThe government is not prepared to combat disasters. Rescue workers have very few boats, while relief camps lack sanitation and other basic facilities. Our party workers tried to provide food to the victims, but CPI(M) cadre stopped them,‚Äù state BJP president Biplab Deb said.

Party spokesperson Ashok Sinha said, ‚ÄúWe have provided three helpline numbers for assistance to marooned people.‚Äù He added that Union home minister Rajnath Singh and DoNER minister Jitendra Singh were being updated about the flood situation.

CAG report on Manipur flood

Heavy to moderate rainfall since August 9 has affected the movement of heavy vehicles on the Imphal-Jiribam highway in Manipur. A house under construction was also swept away in a landslide at Tamenglong, 150 km west of Imphal, on Saturday.

Officials said they took precautionary measures keeping in mind the first wave of floods that claimed 19 lives by mid-July.

But a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) pulled up the government for ‚Äúflood management done without scientific assessment of flood-prone areas‚Äù and not complying with the action plan of national disaster management guidelines.

Researchers have established the extent of concretisation by comparing the spatial maps of the city over the years and contrasting them with the ground situation.The study says concretisation, narrowing of storm water drains, lack of appropriate drainage maintenance are resulting in urban floods -a phenomenon almost regular since the year 2000. If this trend continues, then 94% of Bengaluru will be concrete by 2020.Prof TV Ramachandra from the Centre for Ecological Sciences , IISc, who led the study , said lack of planning and enforcement of laws has resulted in significant narrowing of waterways. He said floodplains (areas next to waterbodies) had been consumed by illegal developments, further leading to flooding in the city.‚ÄúEncroachment of floodplains, obstruction of sewer pipes, manholes, dumped construction material and solid waste have blocked the system,‚Äú he added. Bellandur Lake -which sees fire, smoke and froth every second month as an example of how not to preserve a waterbody -finds a detailed mention in an IISc study on the factors that cause flooding in the city.The story around Bellandur Lake in east Bengaluru, cited in this study along with many others, drives home the point of concretization and narrowing of drains tellingly. At Jakkasandra village, which is upstream of Bellandur Lake, the main storm water drain has shrunk and 50% is concretized between 1908 and 2017, the study adds. Another highlight is 11.03sqkm Kaikondarahalli Lake , which joins downstream of Bellandur Lake. ‚ÄúThis catchment is dominated by infrastructural (residential and commercial) establishments,‚Äú the IISc report notes.The study, conducted with assistance by researchers Vinay S and Bharath H Aithal of IISc, says there was no need to concretize the channel of storm water drains as vegetation in these drains bears the load in peak monsoon. ‚ÄúDrains with vegetation and without any bottlenecks would be the best option to mitigate floods.

The streets of India‚Äôs financial capital are her home and have been for the past 50 years. She and her son, his wife and their one-year-old twins have endured the challenges of seasonal rain and scorching summer heat for decades, but this downpour was a fresh nightmare.

‚ÄúWe have been sitting and sleeping on these steps, because they are a bit higher up, for days now,‚Äù said Rajput, as her daughter sat behind her picking lice out of her hair. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt cook, there is no clean drinking water. The water was up to our waist. Not a single thing was dry. The rich are OK, but we‚Äôre out here with nothing.‚Äù



Devastating rainfall across South Asia has led to the deaths of more than 1,200 people and directly affected more than 40 million people in northern India, southern Nepal, northern Bangladesh and southern Pakistan.

About 60% of Mumbai‚Äôs 20 million residents live in slums, which gives the city its nickname ‚ÄúSlumbai‚Äù. The 2011 Indian census put the number of homeless people in Mumbai at just over 57,000, but local activists say it is more like 150,000-300,000.

As the flood waters began to ebb on Friday, the impact of the disaster on rich and poor people alike was beginning to emerge.

Rescuers worked overnight to pull 12 survivors from the rubble of a building that collapsed on Thursday in the densely populated area of Bhendi Bazaar, killing 34 people.

The 117-year-old, six-storey building had been declared unsafe by the housing regulator in 2011, but many people continued living there. A 20-day-old baby was reported to be among the dead.

Dr Deepak Amarapurkar, 59, a senior gastroenterologist at Bombay hospital, was also among the victims of the extreme weather. He had decided to walk the 10-minute journey through the flooded roads on Tuesday to his home, despite his colleagues advising him to wait until the waters had receded.

On the way, he fell into an open manhole. Onlookers tried to pull him out, but were only able to retrieve his umbrella. Locals said they had removed the manhole lid to help the water level go down. His body later washed up on the shore at Worli, nearly 2.5 miles (4km) away.



With little government help available, some stranded Mumbaiites turned to social media to connect with people willing to put them up for the night.

Mehul Ved, a software professional, created a spreadsheet listing those offering assistance. By Thursday, it contained the names of 6,500 people prepared to help strangers with food, shelter and a change of clothes.



But for those living on the streets, there were no offers of shelter, said Brijesh Arya, the founder of Pehchan, an organisation that supports Mumbai‚Äôs homeless families. He said the community kitchens, government help, and shelter provided by churches, temples and some shopkeepers, were reserved for better-off residents.



‚ÄúThe homeless got nothing,‚Äù said Arya. ‚ÄúThey stayed in the same wet clothes for days. The rains have devastated this vulnerable community. I can‚Äôt forget the words of one woman who said to me ‚ÄòJust bring me poison will you, I want to die,‚Äô because she couldn‚Äôt cope.‚Äù

That woman was Savita Kharve, 45, who was born on the streets of Mumbai and lives with her family on the pavement near Mumbai Central railway station. When Arya visited her, he found ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù conditions. ‚ÄúNo one was eating. The kids are now all sick with runny noses and coughs,‚Äù he said.



The Kharves were huddled together under plastic tarpaulin sheets, strengthened with sticks of bamboo, as makeshift protection from the monsoon rain. Gathered around them were survival essentials: a cooking stove, old clothes, second-hand toys and piles of flowers they continued to prepare to sell as soon as the rain subsided.



In a video recorded on Wednesday in the middle of a storm, Kharve told Arya that she and her children had not eaten since the flooding began. With knee-high water, there was nowhere for them to squat and chop vegetables or put down a cooking stove.



Most of the homeless families are daily-wage workers who buy food each day, a task that became impossible during the storm.

‚ÄúThe children went hungry,‚Äù said Kharve. ‚ÄúLook around you, there is nothing but water, but who cares about us? Who cares about poor people like me? We are drenched.

‚ÄúI have no dry clothes. We are just standing here in the rain with nothing,‚Äù she said, pointing to her few belongings strewn on the wet and muddy pavement.



Many women and children tried to take refuge under shop awnings or in doorways, but were shooed away. ‚ÄúWhere are they supposed to go?‚Äù asked Arya. ‚ÄúThere are no shelters in the city and there is nowhere for them to escape to.‚Äù",flood,2022 Mumbai Floods,"Mumbai, India",26-Jul-22,29-Jul-22,"Mumbai, India",340 mm,$10 billion,100+,40 million people directly affected,"The floods were caused by torrential rain that fell over Mumbai and surrounding areas.

Splurge and save now! Click here

It finds that the states that have recorded the most damage from floods are Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Andhra Pradesh. These states have lesser forest cover compared with states that recorded less damage.

The study‚Äôs findings are important as India has been facing worsening episodes of flooding, affecting millions across numerous states.

‚ÄúLoss of forest cover can make the ecosystem, human habitation and various natural resources more vulnerable to changing climatic conditions in the form of extreme weather events such as floods and other related natural disasters,‚Äù the study says.

The study has also found that greater literacy can reduce flood-related damage as people get more information to prepare better for floods.

Further, the better a state‚Äôs economy (as measured in terms of per capita income), the greater its chance to adapt to a flood situation, the study reports.

These findings are consistent with the results of numerous studies globally which have found that deforestation leads to severe flood damage, especially in developing countries. For instance, this 2007 study by researchers from the National University of Singapore and the Charles Darwin University, Australia, who analysed data from 56 countries, found that forests have a positive correlation with flood risk and severity in developing countries.

The study reinforces the importance of forest protection for human welfare, and suggests that reforestation may help reduce the frequency and severity of flood-related catastrophes.

In response to this year‚Äôs floods, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced funds for flood relief in Bihar, Gujarat and the north-eastern states. However, India needs to shift its focus from flood relief to resilience and adaptation, Kasturi Bhattacharjee, lead author of the study and a PhD scholar at IIT Kharagpur, told IndiaSpend.

‚Äú[M]ajority of the structural measures have failed in the past. Enhancing flood resilience/adaptive capacity by using non-structural measures such as afforestation drives is a way forward,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPlanting trees will not only prevent flood damages, but in turn will support livelihoods of the people living nearby forest areas.‚Äù

The study highlights the importance of forests in the face of increasing frequency of climate extremes. Since forest cover is an important determinant of the extent of flood damage, it is essential that flood mitigation strategies be designed to promote regeneration and protection of forests, especially in flood-prone areas.

The findings have important policy implications for most South Asian countries including Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh that have similar agro-climatic, ecological, topographic, socio-economic and demographic characteristics to India.

In July 2016, India enacted the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act, which plans to spend ‚Çπ41,000 crore ($6.2 billion) to increase India‚Äôs forest cover from 21.34% to 33%. The law stipulates that the majority of afforestation activities will be in tribal-dominated and backward areas so as to generate employment. Afforestation will improve availability of timber and other forest products, thus helping improve the overall living standards of forest-dependent communities.

The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has asked for time until January 2018 from the Rajya Sabha Committee on Subordinate Legislation to frame rules to implement the Act, Down To Earth magazine reported on September 20, 2017.

‚ÄúCompensatory afforestation‚Äù refers to tree plantation to compensate for cutting down forests for agricultural purposes. Some experts believe it is an unscientific and flawed concept because felling trees also leads to collapse of an ecosystem. Planting trees fails to restore the original complexity of flora and fauna, Samarpita Roy, a PhD scholar in environmental science from Pune University, told IndiaSpend for a report published on June 3, 2016.

Bhattacharjee from IIT Kharagpur agrees: Compensatory afforestation ‚Äúis necessary but not sufficient to control floods‚Äù. Afforestation must be accompanied by ecosystem maintenance, she said, adding that forests help increase water retention capacity of the soil and reduce run-off, thereby playing a crucial role in reducing flood occurrence and resultant damage.

Additionally, planting trees that yield fruit and other produce provides livelihood support. ‚ÄúWe need to increase the awareness that forest ecosystems are a lifeline for flood vulnerable households,‚Äù Bhattacharjee said.

The debate around planting trees for mitigating environmental damage has gained strength recently ever since spiritual guru Jaggi Vasudev of Isha Foundation launched a ‚ÄòRally for Rivers‚Äô. The project calls for creating a 1 km buffer of trees alongside all rivers, which it terms the simplest way to save rivers as trees contribute to more rainfall, stop soil erosion and replenish groundwater which, in turn, feeds rivers.

These benefits may be overstated, argues this September 8, 2017, piece in The Wire, pointing out that the project does not address numerous other causes of river degradation such as back-to-back dams, sand mining, pollution, river interlinking and waterway building plans.

However, the IIT Kharagpur study conclusively proves the flood-mitigation benefit of forests.

""The effect appears to be akin to flash flood,"" he said after the aerial survey of flood-hit Kisanganj, Araria, Purnea and Katihar districts.



During the survey, Kumar was accompanied by Disaster Management Minister Dinesh Chandra Yadav and Chief Secretary Anjani Kumar Singh.



Araria, he said, was the worst effected district of the state as flood waters have entered the district headquarter town. Floods waters have also entered areas in Kisanganj, three blocks of Purnea and one block of Katihar and damaged roads.



The chief minister said the state government has been carrying out relief operations in the flood-hit areas on a war footing.



He said principal secretaries of disaster management, road construction and rural development departments would make an aerial survey tomorrow to prepare a detailed report of damage caused by floods.



The Bihar CM thanked the Centre for its prompt response in providing assistance to the state after he spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over phone yesterday.



He said that he also spoke to Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Defence Minister Arun Jaitley on the flood situation.



""I thank the Centre for timely help to the marooned people of Bihar. Besides, Army column sent to Purnea, four teams of NDRF had arrived in Bihar yesterday and six more NDRF teams landed today to assist state to take up relief and rehabilitation work on a war footing,"" he added.



Kumar also directed the district magistrates of the flood affected areas to make an aerial trip to assess the problem and arrange effective relief and rehabilitation accordingly.



Meanwhile, East Central Railway (ECR) said rail traffic has been hit between Kisanganj and Hatwar in West Bengal as water is flowing above the danger mark at pillar number 117 under Katihar division.



A total of 33 trains have been cancelled and 11 short- terminated, ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said in a statement.



Prominent trains cancelled included New Delhi-Dibrugarh Rajdhani Express, Alipurdwar-Delhi Mahananda Express, Guwahati -Lokmanya Tilak Express, North-East Express, Ajmer-Kisanganj Garib Nawaz Express, Amritsar-Katihar.

delhi,2017,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/women-key-to-climate-resilience-59064,15-Nov-17,How Delhi slums can fight climate change,"Women's roups in the national capital are making efforts to build resilience against climatic impacts

Climate change has a disastrous impact on urban infrastructures and services. And Delhi citizens are no strangers to challenges such as air pollution and urban flooding. The capital has been making headlines for the dangerously rising air pollution levels ever since a World Health Organization (WHO) report in 2014 ranked it as one of the most polluted cities in the world. A 2014 United Nations report has also ranked Delhi among the top three most vulnerable cities to floods.



This dangerous convergence of climate change and modern cities poses big challenges for citizens, especially those living in slums. Among them, women face multiple layers of discrimination over access to basic services and livelihoods. Drawing on these challenges, it is pertinent to explore the importance of gender-sensitive strategies to establish climate-resilient slums in Delhi.



Poor, out of focus



WHO says urban poor are the worst impacted by rising air pollution levels in Delhi. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stresses that cities in the developing world, and elsewhere, will be adversely affected by global warming induced climate disruption, leading to food and water shortages, along with higher temperatures due to ‚Äúurban heat island effect‚Äù. Although the rural population is increasingly moving to cities for employment, slum dwellers face considerable challenges that are likely to increase in the context of worsening climate impacts.



Since most slums are illegal, residents have a slim chance of procuring basic facilities such as clean water and sanitation, roads, energy and public transport. Water shortages, heat waves and floods trigger a chain reaction that affects other aspects of their lives such as health, livelihoods and capacity to withstand climate change impacts. However, existing climate policies do not address the vulnerability and risks faced by slum dwellers, despite the fact that they comprise 30 per cent of Delhi‚Äôs population.



The worse half



Of the vulnerable populations in slums, women continue to experience particular hardships. Gender inequalities permeate structures that determine access to resources and other basic amenities such as health, water and sanitation. These pre-existing inequalities are exacerbated by climate-induced events putting them at a further disadvantageous position.



The linkages between gender and climate change have been clearly established in recent years. Women face unique consequences under the impact of climate change in slums. ‚ÄúLack of water/power and necessary resources, crowded population in limited space, lack of hygiene, and awareness contribute to deplorable living conditions in the slums. Girls and women from slums are often subjected to gender-based violence and other dangers quite regularly,‚Äù says Kalyani Raj of the All India Women‚Äôs Conference. ‚ÄúIn such conditions, the urban slum dweller is hardly aware of any climate-related disaster preparedness‚Äîmuch less of resilience. To them, almost every day is a disaster‚Äîwhether caused by human or by nature,‚Äù adds Raj.



Prevailing grim conditions in the slums force women to walk long distances through poorly lit and garbage filled streets to use toilets. Domestic responsibilities often fall on women‚Äôs shoulders which involve organising food and water for the family. These household chores prevent girls from attending schools regularly. These underlying discriminatory factors increase climate-induced risks for women since they have narrow access to rights and resources necessary to counter the impacts of climate change.



What further reduces women‚Äôs capacity to cope with climate change is the asymmetry in wage, based on gender in urban areas. Therefore approaches such as slum upgradation should have special focus on building the capacity of women and children. This will not only improve their quality of life, but also strengthen their resilience to climate change.



Some initiatives have coalesced efforts to bring to fore the gender dimensions of climate change in cities, given that much of the focus till now has been in rural areas. GenderCC‚ÄîWomen for Climate Justice, a global network working for climate and gender justice, has started an initiative for the inclusion of gender into climate adaptation in some pilot cities in India, South Africa and Indonesia. The Gender into Urban Climate Change Initiative seeks to establish knowledge and capacity among civil society and policymakers to integrate gender issues into climate policy. Against this background, it is pertinent to highlight how women in Delhi are converging efforts to build resilience against climatic impacts.



In slums like Bhalswa and Bawana in Delhi, women‚Äôs groups have started to hold the government accountable for providing basic services. Community-level participation of women has spurred more toilet construction as well as street lights in the areas to ensure women‚Äôs safety. The groups now organise monthly meetings with the local councillor to communicate their needs and challenges. This aspect reflects a change in women‚Äôs level of participation in public dialogue. Their involvement in major issues such as clean water, waste management, affordable housing and land rights can go a long way in developing climate-oriented solutions in slums.



Women devise solutions that are climate resilient and pro-poor. Pollinate Energy, a social initiative operating in the slums of Bengaluru, have organised women‚Äôs groups that have opted for cleaner energy such as solar. The shift has helped the families in two ways‚Äîsolar power is cheaper and cleaner than kerosene lamps. Reduction in the gap to access climate viable technologies can act as a springboard to climate resilience even in Delhi slums.



Bijal Brahmbhatt, director Mahila Housing SEWA Trust, says climatic events such as heat waves and water crisis, though not considered as extreme as floods and earthquakes, exert tremendous pressure on the life and livelihoods of urban poor, especially women. Her organisation provides localised technical assistance to women‚Äôs groups. For example, it assisted women from the slums of Odhav in Ahmedabad to make roofs formed of biodegradable polymer that help significantly reduce temperature during summers. Low carbon development practices in the realm of lighting and cooking are relevant to Delhi slums. To realise this aspect, adaptation financing and strong institutional structures are crucial. ‚ÄúWomen can save up money much better than men in the informal settlements. They are also weaving innovative solutions against climate change, but the funds are not earmarked to enhance their adaptation strategies,‚Äù says Lisa Junghans from Germanwatch e.V, a global network that promotes north-south equity.



Climate change pushes inequity



Climate change gives rise to inequities that make those who are already vulnerable slip further into poverty. Environmental activist Vandana Shiva claims that the existing patriarchal nature of the Indian society silences women‚Äôs voices in climate solutions. However, she stresses the fact that women‚Äôs participation remains a fundamental component in strengthening adaptation strategies to climate change. Gender equality and sustainable urbanisation go hand in hand, as the Gender into Urban Climate Change Initiative seeks to demonstrate. In mega-cities, mobilising women into decision making and developing environmentally sustainable practices can bear a direct outcome on improving living conditions in slums. Equipping women to face climate risks will help build long-term resilience and change and maximise women‚Äôs voices in decision-making at the community as well as household level.

Splurge and save now! Click here

An Assam government spokesperson said Modi landed at the Lokapriya Gopinath Bardoloi International Airport around 10 am. He was received by governor Banwarilal Purohit and chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal

From the airport, he flew by a helicopter to the Veterinary College Ground at Khanapara on the southern edge of Guwahati.

The prime minister then drove to the nearby Assam Administrative Staff College where he is scheduled to hold three meetings, before returning to New Delhi in the afternoon.

He was received at the Staff College by the chief minister, his cabinet colleagues and senior state government officials.

‚ÄúHe will meet government officials of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur for assessing the extent of flood damage before meeting party leaders from across the region. He is scheduled to fly back to Delhi by 2:45pm,‚Äù the spokesperson said.

On Monday, former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi said Modi was forced by criticism to visit the flood-affected state.

‚ÄúThe PM preferred to visit Gujarat before Assam, but it is good that he is coming due to public pressure,‚Äù Gogoi said, reminding the prime minister did not lose time in visiting Jammu and Kashmir during the devastating floods in 2014 and announcing a special package while Assam languished.

Gujarat heads to election later this year.

Ranjit K Das, the president of Assam unit of BJP, countered the criticism. ‚ÄúThe prime minister visited Assam thrice in the last 14 months, and he announced today‚Äôs visit while leaving for Gujarat. The Congress should know (former PM) Manmohan Singh did not visit Assam during the floods despite being elected to the Rajya Sabha from the state,‚Äù he said.

Badruddin Ajmal, Lok Sabha member and chief of All India United Democratic Front, hoped Modi would declare the floods in Assam a ‚Äònational calamity‚Äô and announce a financial assistance of at least Rs 20,000-crore.

The national disaster tag has been a long-standing demand of various organisations such as All Assam Students‚Äô Union.

‚ÄúScores of lives have been lost in the floods that left several thousand hectares of agricultural land covered with sand. We want the victims to be suitably compensated,‚Äù Ajmal said.

Assam has experienced worse floods, but the number of dead this time has been unprecedented. Assam State Disaster Management Authority officials said 83 people have died so far, eight of them in Kamrup (Metropolitan) district straddling Guwahati. Four were electrocuted on days when a large part of the city was under waist- or neck-deep water.

The floods also affected more than 17 lakh people across 29 of Assam‚Äôs 32 districts, with 15,746 of them evacuated by relief and rescue personnel. Standing crop on 209,051.65 hectare was damaged while 131,899 were scattered across 363 relief camps.

Last week, Sonowal said his BJP-led coalition government has sought a financial assistance of Rs 2,393-crore from the Centre for post-flood measures while Sarma, the state‚Äôs finance minister, insisted funds were available to tackle the situation.

‚ÄúWe still have Rs 324 crore of unspent money. Last year the Centre had announced Rs 400 crore (for Assam), but did not send it because we had money,‚Äù Sarma said.

Manipur, on the other hand, has suffered a loss of Rs 213.17-crore since Cyclone Mora hit the state in May followed by monsoonal deluge. The state‚Äôs principal secretary (relief and disaster management) MH Khan said the floods killed 19 people, damaged 85,226 hectares of agricultural land, 19,095 houses, 421 government infrastructure including 128 schools, 43 bridges and 35 market sheds.

The flood damage in Arunachal Pradesh is yet to be assessed, but a major landslide at Laptap village near state capital Itanagar buried 14 people alive. At least two others, including a minor girl, were washed away by rivers elsewhere.

Flash floods had also killed at least 12 people in Mizoram two months ago.

Read | Gurgaon‚Äôs stormy mess: How civic systems crumbled under monsoon showers

The fear is not unfounded, considering that despite the administration‚Äôs tall claims much is left to be done on the ground to tackle waterlogging. So far, a repeat has not happened, largely because it has not rained as much this year.

The district administration and the state government insist that they have learned their lessons and have attempted measures to ensure that the city sees no Gurujam 2.0.

Given the lie of the land, waterlogging is a real and perennial problem for the district administration which has failed to adopt larger remedial steps till date. Experts say the water flow, which in Gurgaon is from east to west, has to be streamlined with the master plan.

‚ÄúRainwater flows off the Aravallis in the east, enter the main city and NH-8 and moves towards Najfgarh drain. Most of the smaller drains from the hills are also located in the east and merge with the Badshahpur drain. The district administration does not have a master plan to streamline the stormwater flow and use it to recharge the water table. The main drain is rarely desilted and many sewer lines are also connected to it leading to the deposit of more sludge. In Khandsa, a 600-metre stretch is a chicken neck and the main reason for the flooding of the NH-8 every year,‚Äù said Prof Gauhar Mehmud, HoD, civil engineering, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi.

‚ÄúTemporary arrangements simply won‚Äôt work,‚Äù he said.

The Manohar Lal Khattar government had warned the three major stakeholders ‚Äî Haryana Urban Development Authority (Huda), Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to ensure that all measures are in place this year to tackle waterlogging.

‚ÄúThe administration is fully prepared. Steps such as desilting of drains, deploying adequate staff for emergency and installing motor pumps have been taken,‚Äù said Vinay Pratap Singh, DC Gurgaon.

Huda is the custodian of the city‚Äôs main drain, the 25km Badshahpur drain that passes via Ghata in Gwal Pahari, Sohna Road, NH-8 and Khandsa to merge with Najafgarh Drain. There are several subsidiary channels to Badshahpur drain that put pressure on the main drain throughout the year.

‚ÄúWe have closed four subsidiary channels which flow into Badshahpur. We have also desilted 18km of the drain and created a culvert in Khandsa,‚Äù said Sweta Sharma, executive engineer, Huda.

‚ÄúSeven motor pumps are in place near Khandsa drain to drain out water. Huda has placed two additional 650-metre pipes across the Khandsa village which will take out flood water,‚Äù Sharma said.

To prevent rainwater from accumulating at Hero Honda Chowk, administration has earmarked 19 locations to install pumps.

‚ÄúBadshahpur drain is 30 metres wide except for a 600 metre stretch in Khandsa where it narrows down to 10 metres. Huda has failed to widen it so far. Additional pipes would not help in the long run. Huda does not have check dams across the Aravalli foothills which are essential to hold the run-off rainwater. The government should form team of experts of environmentalists, engineers and officials to find a permanent solution,‚Äù said Darshan Singh, an expert on rainwater.

Gurgaon‚Äôs average rainfall is 595mm of which 90% goes waste. Lack of rainwater harvesting systems is another big lacuna on part of the district administration.

Desilting Najafgarh drain

Following a meeting of officials of Delhi and Haryana, a joint inspection of the Najafgarh drain was carried out and a report was prepared and submitted to the ministry of urban development.

The report exposed a glaring fact‚Äî several points in the Najafgarh drain were blocked by silt deposits.

This meant that the natural course of rainwater from Aravallis through Badshahpur drain to the Najafgarh drain, which empties into the Yamuna, was affected.

The silt deposits had caused the stream bed to rise, affecting the natural flow of water at the junction of the two drains. That, in a nutshell, explained the backflow which flooded Gurgaon roads.

To clear the blockages, officials engaged earthmoving and suction machines this yea rand restored the natural flow of water.

Hero Honda Chowk

Hero Honda Chowk, a low-lying area, is prone to waterlogging. The fact that it is right next to the Badshahpur drain also doesn‚Äôt help. Backflow during peak monsoon often floods this crucial junction on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, throwing traffic out of gear.

To prevent rainwater from accumulating at the chowk, authorities installed 19 pumps to remove the excess water but without formulating a plan on where the water will be channelled.

Last year, authorities installed pumps and channelled water towards residential areas in sectors 37 and 10, flooding the ground-level houses there.

Given that the Badshahpur drain is not an option‚Äî the drain is susceptible to overflowing ‚Äî it remains to be seen where the authorities will divert the water this year.",flood,Gurugram Floods 2018,"Gurgaon, Haryana, India","July 17, 2018","July 20, 2018","['Gurgaon', 'Delhi']","['200 mm, 150 mm']","['$100 million', '100,000 people displaced']",['20'],"['Major traffic disruption', 'Power outages', 'Damage to property']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe
delhi,2017,https://thewire.in/environment/floods-landslides-havoc-in-northeast-dead-displaced,25-Jun-17,"Floods and Landslides Create Havoc in Northeast; Several Dead, Thousands Displaced","New Delhi: Flash floods and landslides, triggered by incessant rains, have continued to create havoc in the northeast, claiming several lives and displacing thousands of people besides damaging crops, properties and all means of communication.

On June 22, a young man was killed by electrocution in a waterlogged street of the largest city of the region, Guwahati. An employee of a fast food joint, Dulal Malakar, entered the water-filled street to his home in the city‚Äôs Zoo Road area, not knowing that a high tension power line from a post nearby had snapped due to the heavy rains.

Local media reports quoting eye witnesses said Malakar screamed as soon as he entered the water, forcing many others to stop from going ahead. They said he died within a few minutes. His body was thereafter washed away by rain and was fished out by local residents some distance away half an hour later. Reports said another person was injured due to electrocution in the same spot earlier in the day.

Since June 13, this is the third death on the flooded streets of the city due to electrocution. The city administration has ordered a magisterial inquiry into these incidents.

Meanwhile, all educational institutions have been closed in the city due to inability of school buses and other vehicles to ply on the inundated streets. The water level in many places has reached waist level, forcing a large number of people to stay away from work. Long hours of power cut and lack of water supply has further affected daily lives.

Assam chief minister Sarbanada Sonowal called an emergency meeting of city officials to take stock of the situation, soon after Malakar‚Äôs death due to electrocution was reported, and asked Assam Power Distribution Corporation Limited, responsible for power supply and upkeep of the lines, to pay a sum of Rs 2.5 lakh to Malakar‚Äôs family. The Kamrup (Metro) district administration also released an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh under the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF).

Other parts of Assam too have been affected by flooding due to the heavy downpour since the last few days. The continuous rain has led to a rise in the water level of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries, particularly affecting those living in the districts of Lakhimpur, Darrang and Hailakandi. According to Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), over 400 hectares of farmland with standing crops have been affected due to the rains in these districts. The Darrang district is reported to be the worst affected with houses of about 25,000 people from 52 villages under Sipajhar and Patharughat revenue circle submerged by the rising waters of the Nonoi river.

Meanwhile, the local administration has clamped prohibitory orders along National Highway 37 that passes through the Kaziranga national park to enable free and easy movement of the animals coming out of the park during the rains.

Bokakhat sub divisional officer (civil) Dhiraj Das told local reporters that like the previous years, Section 144 has been imposed along the highway since June 18 till further orders as the water levels of the Brahmaputra and Difloo rivers have been on the rise, submerging many parts of the park. Animals cross the highway to enter the highlands in the adjoining Karbi Anglong district during the monsoons. Presence of too many people and vehicles may disrupt their movement to safety. Keeping this in mind, the speed of vehicular traffic has also been ordered to be reduced to 30 km per hour.

Meanwhile, heavy rains have disrupted everyday life in most of the other northeastern states too. In Tripura, over 2000 families have been displaced after rain waters surged into their houses. As per local media reports, the displaced, belonging to West Tripura and Khowai districts, have been put up in 50 relief camps.

The state administration has used the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Tripura State Rifles teams besides officials of the district administrations to supply relief and rescue to the affected. State chief minister Manik Sarkar held an emergency meeting with the concerned officials on June 20 to review the rescue and rehabilitation situation and directed the administration to open control rooms in the affected districts.

State meteorological department head Dilip Saha told local reporters that the capital city itself has received much more rains than it usually does this time of the year. ‚ÄúIn June, 695 mm rainfall was recorded in Agartala against the expected normal monsoon rainfall of 421 mm,‚Äù he said.

In Manipur too, at least 14 people have been reported to be dead and several others missing so far due to heavy rains lashing the state. The rains have led to a rise in the water levels of rivers Imphal, Iril and Nambuk, causing submersion of low lying areas in several places, including the state chief minister N. Biren‚Äôs constituency, Heingang.

As per media reports on June 14, not just the roads of Imphal but even its flyovers were filled with rain waters, stopping vehicular traffic altogether. Reports said many houses in the Kangpokpi district have been submerged by the rain waters leading to displacement of people while several villages in Senapati district have lost connectivity with the rest of the state. Flood waters have also affected some parts of the national highway that connects Nagaland to Manipur and Assam besides affecting standing crops.

In Mizoram, since June 9, the incessant rains have triggered heavy landslides and floods. As per latest reports, at least 12 people have died and 877 buildings destroyed in the state. Around ten buildings have submerged in Aizawl itself. Around 100 families have been shifted to safer places from over 50 other buildings in the last few days. Power supply and telecommunication networks have been badly affected.

According to the state disaster management and rehabilitation department on June 18, the flood waters have damaged 137 hectares of cultivated areas and 62 fish ponds. As many as 2000 families have been affected, it said.

The entire south Mizoram bordering Myanmar has remained cut off from the rest of the state since June 15. State chief minister Lal Thanhawla has set up a high level committee to assess the flood situation.

In Meghalaya‚Äôs Ri Bhoi district, at least three people have been reported killed and three others missing due to landslides caused by the rains.

Meanwhile, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) has opened the Bhalukpong-Charduar-Tawang road in Arunachal Pradesh for vehicular traffic on June 22. The strategic road, which connects the country‚Äôs border with China in Bumla area, had been closed since June 19 due to landslides caused by heavy rains. The landslides stranded over 200 people including tourists, leading the BRO to create a foot route to rescue them.

The rains have continued to throw life out of gear in the entire state. Power supply has been badly affected due to it. As per latest reports, the army rescued over 200 people, including 50 children, stranded due to landslides in the West Kameng district. On June 18, a school girl was killed and three others were seriously injured in a landslide in a village near the state capital, Itanagar. As per local police, at least five houses were destroyed in the landslide.",flood,Northeast India Floods,Northeast India,Jun-09,Jun-22,"['Assam', 'Tripura', 'Manipur', 'Mizoram', 'Meghalaya', 'Arunachal Pradesh']","['Assam: 695 mm', 'Tripura: 421 mm', 'Manipur: 14 people', 'Mizoram: 12 people', 'Meghalaya: 3 people', 'Arunachal Pradesh: 1 person']","['Assam: 400 hectares of farmland', 'Tripura: 2000 families displaced', 'Manipur: several houses submerged', 'Mizoram: 137 hectares of cultivated areas, 62 fish ponds', 'Meghalaya: 3 people killed', 'Arunachal Pradesh: 200 people stranded']","['Assam: 3', 'Tripura: 0', 'Manipur: 14', 'Mizoram: 12', 'Meghalaya: 3', 'Arunachal Pradesh: 1']","['Assam: disruption of everyday life', 'Tripura: displacement of people', 'Manipur: submersion of low lying areas', 'Mizoram: damage to buildings, power supply and telecommunication networks', 'Meghalaya: landslides', 'Arunachal Pradesh: landslides, stranded people']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

At least 200,382 people belonging to 52,603 families were affected in 14 districts. Further, 12,007 people belonging to 2,937 families were relocated to 69 safe locations as of Saturday morning, it said.

India in response dispatched three Navy ships with emergency supplies to help Sri Lanka in the rescue and relief operations.

The fist Indian navy ship with rescue and relief materials arrived Saturday morning at the Port of Colombo.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs tri-forces personnel including more than 1,000 Army troops were engaged in the rescue and relief operations.

A Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) airman died after falling from a helicopter during a flood rescue operation in Neluwa area in Galle.

Officials said the death toll from floods crossed 100 while 99 others were missing but did not provide the exact numbers.

The Meteorology Department said that rain and windy conditions are expected to continue.

‚ÄúShowers or thundershowers will occur at times in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Central and North-western provinces,‚Äù it said.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs ministry of foreign affairs in coordination with the ministry of Disaster Management appealed to the UN, International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) and neighbouring countries to provide assistance to affected people, especially in the areas of search and rescue operations.

Sri Lankan foreign minister Ravi Karunanayake, who was present to receive the ship, said: ‚ÄúWe are grateful to India for sending relief at such a short notice so quickly.‚Äù

He said India‚Äôs move to send relief materials demonstrated the Indo-Lanka relations which are at an excellent level.

INS Kirch diverted to Colombo to render immediate assistance in flood relief operations, arrived in Colombo Port today. Indian high commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu handed over the relief items brought by INS Kirch to foreign minister Ravi Karunanayake.

Two more Indian Navy ships -- INS Shardul and INS Jalashwa -- have also left for Sri Lanka with relief materials including food medicines and water.

Medical and diving teams along with boats and helicopters are also being sent on board INS Jalashwa to assist Sri Lanka in rescuing people from flood-hit area, Indian Navy spokesperson Captain D K Sharma said.

The flooding is the worst since May 2003 when 250 people were killed and 10,000 homes destroyed after a similarly powerful Southwest monsoon, officials said.

Sri Lanka‚Äôs ministry of foreign affairs said it had activated the Emergency Response Unit to coordinate rescue and relief measures related to the flood situation.

Sri Lanka, which has been heavily deforested for cash crops, often witnesses landslides during the monsoon season.

Click here

BB Lal, former director general of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) known for his works on Ayodhya, presented a research paper on Manu‚Äôs flood at a seminar organised by the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) on Monday.

Lal arrived at the findings by linking the flood to the disappearance of the Saraswati river through archaeological evidence.

‚ÄúArchaeologically, the deluge of the Saraswati took place round 2,000-1,900 Before Common Era (BCE) or broadly, in the first quarter of the second millennium BCE. This was exactly the time of Manu‚Äôs flood, which occurred after the Rigveda, but before the beginning of the second millennium BCE. Should we still call Manu‚Äôs Flood a myth,‚Äù the abstract of Lal‚Äôs paper read.

Professor KS Valdiya, former vice-chancellor of Kumaon university, said the mythical Saraswati river had nurtured human settlements of Harappan civilization, and tectonic upheaval and related geological developments had resulted in the river being ‚Äúreduced to a misfit river in which only flood waters flow‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe Saraswati was a victim of river piracy, not once but twice.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Rigveda and the Puranas describe and eulogise this river as the greatest and the finest of all rivers of Bharatvarsh, and the old British time government revenue records show it as the Saraswati or Sarsuti,‚Äù reads the abstract of the paper by Valdiya.

The three-day seminar on ‚ÄòAntiquity, Continuity and Development of Civilisation and Culture in Bharat (India) up to 1st Millennium BC‚Äô was slated to be inaugurated by Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar. He, however, could not make it to the event.

Lal, is also working on a book on the same subject. His book ‚ÄòRama, His Historicity, Mandir and Setu: Evidence of Literature, Archaeology and Other Sciences‚Äô had created an uproar as it talked about the possible presence of a Hindu temple structure beneath the Babri Masjid.

ICHR chairman Sudarshan Rao said the seminar aimed to find a connection among the various civilisations that spanned between 4th millennium BC and 1st millennium BC.

Rao claimed that the ancient civilisations between 4th millennium BC and 1st millennium BC were correlated and added that the seminar will seek to delve into this connection.

ICHR is a flagship research-based institution under the ministry of human resource development.

Twenty-six research papers would be presented during the seminar, which marks the 45th anniversary of the ICHR which was founded on March 27, 1972.

David Frawley, the director of the American Institute of Vedic Studies in the US, is also taking part in the seminar, along with other noted scholars.

In addition to Gujarat, Rajasthan, Assam and Odisha are among states badly hit by floods.

Leaders in several of these states have sought for more funds, but central government sources said many are yet to use the money they already have.

Rescuers carry out relief work in a flooded locality after heavy rains in Ahmedabad on Thursday. (PTI)

‚ÄúAssam, for instance, has over Rs 500 crore which has not been used, even as it wants around Rs 3,000 crore as interim relief. Similarly, Odisha has Rs 824 crore. Many other states have enough money lying with them. An inter-ministerial group is now visiting Assam to take stock of the situation. If it finds the requirement of more money, we will provide it,‚Äù said a government official, wishing not to be identified.

The disclosure was similar to what Rijiju said in Parliament.

‚ÄúIf you look at the data, you will realise every state has not completely used the amount provided under SDRF and NDRF, which as an additional amount,‚Äù Rijiju said, referring to the state and national disaster relief funds.

The minister was responding to a calling attention motion ‚Äî a parliamentary procedure by which members can raise matters of public importance and seek responses from the government.

The Centre cannot be biased, the minister told the House. ‚ÄúThe Rs 500 crore sanctioned to Gujarat was what was due to them under SDRF.‚Äù

The sanction had prompted members of the Opposition in Assam ‚Äî a BJP-ruled state ‚Äî to criticise the government.

Assam Congress MP Nipun Bora accused the Union government of ‚Äústep-motherly treatment‚Äù and criticised the Prime Minister for not visiting the state as he had done in the case of Gujarat.

In response, Rijiju said that primary responsibility to deal with natural calamities lies with state governments and the Centre only supplements their efforts by offering financial and logistical support.

He asserted that states have adequate funds to tackle disasters, which are replenished with additional relief amount when exhausted.

‚ÄúI can assure this House that the government is fully committed to ensure that nobody suffers due to want of the action from the Government of India. We are fully committed.

It was early on Tuesday morning when residents in the Indian capital of Delhi first began to notice the thick white haze that had descended across the city.

Initially viewed as a mild irritant, by mid-week its debilitating effects were evident to all, as the city struggled to adapt to the new eerie, martian-like conditions brought about by the pollution.

With visibility severely reduced, trains have been canceled, planes delayed and cars have piled into each other, with multiple traffic accidents reported across the city.

The sense that this is now a city under siege has been enhanced by the unusually far-reaching actions of the Delhi government.

The Delhi government has suspended all civic construction projects as part of several emergency measures intended to help tackle the pollution crisis. DOMINIQUE FAGET/AFP/AFP/Getty Images

On Tuesday afternoon, city chiefs closed all public and private schools, requesting instead that the city‚Äôs tens of thousands of school-aged children remain indoors; on Wednesday, they banned incoming trucks and halted civil construction projects; while on Thursday, they announced new plans to begin implementing a partial ban on private car use as of next week.

But as the city woke up Friday to a fourth straight day of heavy pollution, practical considerations were being overtaken by more serious concerns, with journalists and doctors warning residents of the long-term health implications.

Air quality readings in the Indian capital have reached frightening levels in recent days, at one point topping the 1,000 mark on the US embassy air quality index. The World Health Organization considers anything above 25 to be unsafe.

That measure is based on the concentration of fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, per cubic meter. The microscopic particles, which are smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, are considered particularly harmful because they are small enough to lodge deep into the lungs and pass into other organs, causing serious health risks.

Across the capital, doctors reported a surge in patients complaining of chest pain, breathlessness and burning eyes.

‚ÄúThe number of patients have increased obviously,‚Äù said Deepak Rosha, a pulmonologist at Apollo Hospital, one of the largest private hospitals in Delhi. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever been so bad in Delhi. I‚Äôm very angry that we‚Äôve had to come to this.‚Äù

Breathing in air with a PM2.5 content of between 950 to 1,000 is considered roughly equivalent to smoking 44 cigarettes a day, according to the independent Berkeley Earth science research group.

A report by the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur carried out in 2014 found that vehicle omissions accounted for 20% of Delhi's annual PM2.5 levels. PRAKASH SINGH/AFP/AFP/Getty Images

Suffocating feeling

According to experts, Delhi pollution is made up of a combination of vehicle exhaust, smoke from garbage fires and crop burning, and road dust.

Writing on Twitter, Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi‚Äôs chief minister, described the city as ‚Äúa gas chamber.‚Äù

Unsurprisingly, stores selling masks and air purifiers have reported a jump in sales, as many of the city‚Äôs wealthier residents look to mitigate the smog‚Äôs more harmful effects.

But outside on the city‚Äôs streets, the majority of people ‚Äì unable to afford expensive preventive measures ‚Äì are forced to endure the conditions as best they can.

Many of Delhi's residents are either unaware of the dangers of breathing in polluted air, or are unable to afford masks and other protective measures. DOMINIQUE FAGET/AFP/AFP/Getty Images

‚ÄúMy eyes are tearing up from the smoke and I feel suffocated,‚Äù said college student Swati Kashyap, while waiting for her bus amid congested traffic.

Yogesh Kumar, a cab driver, spends his day in a car. As he speaks, he regularly pauses to cough. ‚ÄúMy doctor told me twice to wear a pollution mask, but I didn‚Äôt,‚Äù he said.

Those who do cover their face are usually not wearing N95 grade masks, the standard for filtering out PM 2.5 particles. Most of the masks are makeshift ‚Äî a kerchief tied over the mouth underneath a motorcycle helmet or a scarf tied over the head.

delhi,2017,https://scroll.in/article/854820/in-the-flood-ravaged-sunderbans-women-often-have-to-face-the-biggest-brunt-of-the-destruction,24-Oct-17,"In the flood-ravaged Sunderbans, women often have to face the biggest brunt of the destruction","‚ÄúMy land is gone. My house is gone. My husband is crippled. My sons are away. We have no crops, no firewood,‚Äù said Manuara Bibi of Baliara village in Mousuni Island in the Sundarbans. ‚ÄúOur lives are meaningless. We have become beggars in our own land.‚Äù

Like many others on the island, Manuara Bibi has seen the river taking acres of land. After the floods took the last piece of her house, she waits for the water to subside, in a 6ft x 6ft stilt house, barely accommodating the six remaining members of her family. Her situation is not unique and applies to hundreds like her living on the 54 inhabited islands of the Indian Sundarbans.

The geographical location of islands such as Mousuni make the inhabitants more vulnerable due to floods and embankment erosion, compounded by institutional negligence and human interference. Even as the floods and erosions impact the impoverished inhabitants of the island, it is the women who bear consequences of the hazards the most.

Flooding and salinity ingress

River bank erosion in Mousuni Island is occurring at a rate of 1.02 km per year, wreaking havoc and claiming several houses and farmlands. ‚ÄúThose three huts will be gone next year. We thought the river will take them this time itself, but by god‚Äôs grace, they got saved,‚Äù Kusum of Baliara told VillageSquare.in, pointing at the three small dwellings on the edge of the bank.

In Mousuni Island, salinity ingress has rendered agricultural land uncultivable for years. Tidal flooding that occurs twice a month makes it difficult for the salinity level to come down. Embankments, some of which have existed since colonial times, have weakened over the years. It is due to a combination of natural events like floods and erosion and anthropogenic factors such as lack of maintenance and deforestation. These weak, and in some cases, partially built embankments, prevent swift back-flow of the flood waters in some parts of the island, resulting in inundation for an extended period of time.

Men migrate, women remain

In such a hostile environment, the men often migrate to seek employment. Our study of 60 households in three habitations of Mousuni Island found at least one male member in each of the households having migrated for work. The women are left behind to look after the children and the elderly.

Cyclone Aila, which hit the island in 2009, resulted in loss of croplands and fishing boats, causing agriculture and culture fisheries take a severe blow. This compelled the men from this area to migrate to the gulf countries.

This out-migration has resulted in rising security concerns for the women, leaving them physically and emotionally vulnerable. ‚ÄúEven his father had to go away. Last monsoon, I was alone when the water rushed in. I had nobody. I just stood in the water clutching my child,‚Äù Mamani Maiti of Kusumtala tells VillageSquare.in. ‚ÄúIn my island we never saw this. This scares me.‚Äù She lives alone with her two-year-old son, after her husband left for Dubai last June.

In order to support the family, the women in the islands look for work, including manual labour. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much work for us. I carried cement sacks last month, for a house construction in Poila Gheri. They were heavy and I got tired easily. But I didn‚Äôt have a choice,‚Äù Shikha Guin of Baliara, a widow and mother of two, tells VillageSquare.in.

For a pot of water

Salinity ingress has rendered the homestead ponds saline. For all domestic purposes, including water for their cattle, women in the island are now dependent on tube wells. During our study, we found that on an average, 300 people depend daily on a single tube well.

While some families live in close proximity to a tube well, many women have to travel two to three km to get water, especially when the nearest tube well gets defunct. The women sometimes have to depend on tube wells in schools, off limits during school hours. They often have to queue in the wee hours of the morning to fill up enough vessels for the day, making about six trips on an average.

The situation worsens during monsoons when they have to tread in ankle-deep floodwater to reach a tube well. Often the women wait for low tide, so as to move easily. Speaking to VillageSquare.in, Uma Soren from Baliara remarks, ‚ÄúIn the monsoons, we queue for half-an-hour, fill heavy vessels and walk back in the dirty water! Our skin itches. It‚Äôs a task to keep from falling down. Sometimes the stored water gets over by early evening. With no lights, you can‚Äôt be sure if you‚Äôll come back home alive.‚Äù

Life after loss

The island has three flood shelters. Payel Samanta, whose family has been residing in one of them for three years after losing everything to the river, laments how she is ostracised by the others in the neighborhood. ‚ÄúThey say we have encroached on property that belongs to everyone. But where can we go? We have nothing left.‚Äù Her husband is one of the few remaining in the island, with no means to migrate.

Apart from the physical hardships, the angst that the women go through is aptly described by Rebati Doloi from Kusumtala, ‚ÄúWe lost our boat last year. So now my husband tries to fish floating across the river on a big jar. When the water becomes turbulent, I lose sight of him. I feel scared for him,‚Äù she told VillageSquare.in. The fact that he has to catch fish risking his life describes the plight of those who have not been able to migrate for different reasons.

Access to sanitation, health

Lack of access to safe sanitation adds another element of risk for the women on the island. With the land not in their name, for the women, particularly in women-headed households, it is difficult to get a toilet sanctioned. The ones who do have toilets still prefer the outdoors. Because toilets without water for flushing is an added drudgery as the women have to make additional trips to fetch water.

During monsoons, the toilets often get submerged for nearly four months, leaving the women with no option but to defecate in the open. All these dampen the construction and use of toilets. As Shiuli Pramanik from Baliara told VillageSquare.in, ‚ÄúWhat is the point of having a toilet? It goes under water when we need it the most, during the monsoons!‚Äù

Health facilities on the island, for flood-affected families in general and women in particular, remain deplorable. The primary health centre in the village is highly inadequate, with no electricity. In fact, Mousuni Island is yet to be electrified, one of the last such islands in the Sundarbans.

The women are often unaware of hygienic menstrual practices. ‚ÄúCases of urinary tract infection are common,‚Äù comments the head ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) worker of the village Primary Health Centre, ‚Äúthus leading to increased chances of cervical cancers.‚Äù

A pregnant woman has to cross two rivers to reach the district hospital in Namkhana for delivery, often by herself, since her husband would be away making a living. ‚ÄúI am due end of this year. I am praying that my husband comes back before that. How will I manage on my own?‚Äù asked 21-year-old Kajol, who is expecting her first child, with her husband in Dubai.

With no access to LPG, the women depend on firewood and are exposed to greater threats from indoor carbon monoxide pollution. Privacy is indeed a luxury for the women in the island. During floods, nearly 10 persons are huddled together in a 6ft x 6ft floor space.

Need for interventions

The discourse on the effect of floods tends to look at the affected population as a homogenous entity. The entire population is seen as flood-affected. But the everyday struggles faced by the women in Mousuni show that women are more vulnerable.

It is of utmost importance that one undertakes a granular understanding of how floods and erosion affect the lives and livelihoods of women in flood-prone areas. Accordingly, interventions that would ameliorate the wretched conditions of the women in flood-affected areas need to be promoted.

In Mousuni, interventions towards easy access to safe sanitation and drinking water source would go a long way in ameliorating the miseries faced by the women. Provision of sanitary pads coupled with behaviour change communication activities would make a significant dent in the gynecological morbidity faced by the women on the island. An increased number of flood houses with separate sanitation and bathing space for women would reduce the vulnerability that they currently face.

Skill training for women in new activities like prawn culture and rural tourism could offer them an alternate livelihood.

delhi,2017,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/gujarat-floods-the-deluge-4775591/,31-Jul-17,Gujarat floods: How the deluge crippled the state,"A year ago, farmers in Banaskantha were praying to the rain gods. The South West monsoon had started to recede and the district had not received enough rainfall till September 18. The Met department had labelled the district yellow on its map as it had recorded a rainfall deficit of 48 per cent. The situation was same in neighbouring Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Anand, and parts of north Gujarat. This year, the farmers are in misery again. Their crops and homes washed away as incessant torrential rain hit the central and north Gujarat. Rivers swelled, dams overflowed, canals breached, and the downpour continued. By July 21, the state had received almost half (45.90 per cent) of the entire season‚Äôs average rainfall, and in the next seven days the state received a quarter of the season‚Äôs rainfall (26.57 per cent). The huge volume of downpour concentrated for a few days and in few districts took everyone by surprise, from ordinary citizens to those in the state administration.

Anuradha Mall, chief executive officer of Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA), the nodal authority to tackle such situation, described it like this. ‚ÄúEvery one was well prepared in advance, but it (the rainfall) turned out to be more than expected. It was like the clouds were locked over Gujarat and therefore the rainfall was concentrated over a few districts.‚Äù It all began from Surendranagar district in Saurashtra or central Gujarat. Spread over 10,000 square km and with a predominantly rural population, the district was first hit by heavy downpour that started from July 14. Between July 21 and 22, the district received over 110 mm of rainfall ‚Äînearly 20 per cent of the district‚Äôs average rain in 24 hours. Several talukas of the district got inundated, death toll in rain-related incidents jumped to 65 and nearly 29 dams in Saurashtra started to overflow. As the state and district administration rushed to provide relief and rescue people, more ominous news awaited.

By July 23, rain had eased in Surendranagar, Morbi and Rajkot, but Met department warned of more rain in north Gujarat. By the time Chief Minister Vijay Rupani returned from Chotila town, the worst-hit by rain in Surendranagar, the headlines shifted to Sabarkantha and Banaskantha in north.

Between July 24 and 25, Banaskantha recorded a whopping 257 mm of rainfall, nearly 40 per cent of the entire monsoon rainfall in nearly 24 hours. Sabarkantha too faced flood-like situation. The district recorded 180 mm, nearly a quarter of season‚Äôs rain in one day. The same night, neighbouring Patan and Gandhinagar districts also recorded rainfall of over 100 mm. (See graph)

The downpour refused to abate as it continued for the next two days, with Banaskantha and Sabarkantha districts receiving over 100 mm of rainfall.It worsened further. Rainfall in Aravallis in neighbouring Rajasthan led to swelling of Banas river, which flows through Banaskantha and Patan.

The flood situation compounded further with a major breach in the Narmada canal near Kankrej in Banaskantha. The canal supplies Narmamda water to Rajasthan. According to officials, the death toll would have been far less if the canal had not breached. ‚ÄúThe death of 14 members of a family at Khariya village in Kankrej was because of the breach in the Narmada canal, otherwise the toll would have been much lesser,‚Äù Principal Secretary (Revenue Department) Pankaj Kumar, who has been overlooking the relief and rescue operations, told The Indian Express on Sunday.

‚ÄúThe breach occurred near Thara village in Banaskantha. We had to evacuate over 10,000 people from that area,‚Äù he added. By Sunday, the irrigation department said that Narmada, the largest reservoir in the state, was filled to 94 per cent of its capacity. Almost 35 dams were overflowing, and 49 others had been put on high alert.

The severity of the flood and the havoc it caused could be guaged not only from the death toll ‚Äî 213 and counting ‚Äî and damage done to roads, canals, houses and other infrastructure, but also from the expansive relief and rescue operations. As the flood situation started looking grim in the third week of July, the government had to rope in Navy, Air Force, Army, beside teams of National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) and state police to carry out the relief operations. Till now, over 17,000 people have been rescued and nearly 1.13 lakh people evacuated, of which 59,189 from two districts of Banaskantha and Patan.

Express Photo Express Photo

A total of 32 NDRF teams, five columns of Army, 10 IAF helicopters, 11 SDRF teams, 18 BSF teams and other local teams took part in the relief operations that stretches from Saurashtra to north Gujarat. Describing the operations ‚Äúan example of good flood management,‚Äù Pankaj Kumar said: ‚ÄúWe had strategically deployed rescue teams before the flood-like situation emerged, so that we were able to make timely evacuation. In Banaskantha alone, we had stationed 10 NDRF teams before the flooding began. This resulted in very less number of loss of human life and cattle deaths (4,170 animals)‚Ä¶ Only 63 people died due to flooding during the last one week in Banaskantha and Patan. If you have a five lakh population affected by flood, then these deaths are just 0.05 per cent of those evacuated. We saved 95.95 per cent of the vulnerable population‚Ä¶ The death figure could have run into hundreds had it not been for the large-scale evacuation,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThis is a case where we had proper planning, good and accurate forecast, advance and timely action, regulating the flow of water from the dams, redeployment of rescue teams and evacuation,‚Äù Kumar said, adding that the state government also made use of social and traditional media platforms to successfully ward off rumours about the breach in Sipu and Macchu dams. ‚ÄúWe tried to give real-time information about the flood situation on social media. This helped in warding off rumours,‚Äù he added.

Following the tragedy at Khariya village where houses were washed away by swelling river, the government undertook an aerial survey of the entire Narmada canal in both Banaskantha and Patan districts. The move, Kumar said, was largely meant to assess the damage done to the canal and the availability of drinking water in the region. ‚ÄúPictures of the aerial survey show that the canal has been breached at several places within a one kilometre area. JCBs and other equipment have been deployed to repair the breached section of the canal,‚Äù he said. The government also conducted an aerial survey of the 200-km-long Banas river. ‚ÄúThere is always a possibility that some bodies could be washed away and if you do not do this survey, you will find something here or there after 10 days,‚Äù Kumar said. The Banas river bank was videographed for two days and no bodies were found. Surveys are being carried out to assess the physical structure of dams like Sipu, Dantiwada and Macchu.

With the rain easing for now, the government is focusing on restoration of roads, power and providing relief. Of the 753 villages where power supply was cut off, power has been restored in 700 of them, said the government. Close to 1,500 sanitation workers have been deployed in Banaskantha and Patan for mop up operations to prevent out break of diseases.

The havoc created by the rainfall was the result of a ‚Äústrange and unpredictable‚Äù phenomenon, according to weather scientists. ‚ÄúThe heavy downpour in such a brief period over a small region was the result of a combination of two systems, both developed from Bay of Bengal branch of South West Monsoon,‚Äù said Ahmedabad region director of Meteorological Department Jayanta Sarkar.

The first system that developed on July 21 hit Morbi and Surendranagar districts and continued till 23. It was supposed to dry down and move and towards west within three days, but it could not move ahead because of the second system approaching from Madhya Pradesh. ‚ÄúThe two combined, resulting in heavy rainfall again from July 25 till 27 in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Patan and Gandhinagar,‚Äù he said.

In 2015, the state was facing deficit rainfall, but heavy rainfall for two to three days in July led to flood in four districts of Amreli, Kutch, Patan and Banaskantha. The vagaries in rainfall could be seen this year too. While some districts in north and central parts of the state have been hit by flood, south Gujarat districts of Tapi and Dangs have received only 50 per cent rainfall. Till July 28, the coastal district of Bhavnagar recorded only 46.84 per cent rainfall, while Vadodara and Chhota Udepur got only 43.55 and 44.25 per cent of total rainfall, respectively.

While one school of weather experts believe that this unpredictable and extreme weather condition is attributed to the ‚Äúclimate change‚Äù, the IMD regional director, however, disagrees. ‚ÄúWe cannot directly link it to global warming, but then we also cannot rule out its possibility as such extreme weather conditions across the world are not a rare phenomenon now,‚Äù Sarkar added.

Last year, however, Sarkar had warned of such extreme rainfall in the future too. GSDMA CEO Anuradha Mall said that this phenomenon has not happened in last so many years. ‚ÄúAs far as I remember, Gujarat had received such heavy rain in 1973-74. After that, I fail to remember when did this happen.‚Äù As per the Met department though a low pressure built over Gujarat has weakened, the cyclonic circulation still exists over eastern Rajasthan. ‚ÄúOn Saturday, another system developed over Saurashtra-Kutch area, but it is not very strong. This will result in some rainfall over Saurashtra and Kutch, but will decrease from Sunday,‚Äù Sarkar said.",flood,Gujarat Floods 2017,"Gujarat, India",21-Jul-17,28-Jul-17,"['Banaskantha', 'Sabarkantha', 'Patan', 'Gandhinagar', 'Morbi', 'Surendranagar', 'Rajkot']","['257 mm, 180 mm, 100 mm']","['4,170 animal deaths, 213 human deaths']",,"['5 lakh people affected, 1.13 lakh people evacuated, 17,000 people rescued']","['Narmada canal breached', '35 dams overflowing', '49 dams on high alert']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The most vulnerable stretches include Adarsh Nagar-Hakikat Nagar-Jahangirpuri Metro Station, Anand Parbat Road near Gali No. 10, Archana T-point (Greater Kailash), Mukarba Chowk to Model Town via Azadpur, Bhishma Pitamaha Marg towards Pragati Vihar Hostel, Hansraj Gupta Marg, and DND Flyover towards Maharani Bagh.

From March, the list is sent to all civic agencies concerned so that desilting and road repairs are carried before monsoons, so that traffic on the roads is not affected.

‚ÄúEvery year a fresh list is prepared. Since no remedial action is taken by civic and road agencies, some stretches repeatedly feature in the list. In March, we start writing to agencies to complete all the repair work. It is also followed by repeated reminders. But that‚Äôs all we can do,‚Äù said a senior traffic official.

He also said some stretches such as Adhchini T-Point on Aurbindo Marg, Andheria Mor on MG Road, Barf Khana Chowk to Tis Hazari, and 100-foot T-point Anuvrat Marg, have featured in the list for the past 15 years.

Transport and city planning experts said many busy junctions were waterlogged due to encroachment and manual desilting of drains.

‚ÄúThe entire natural drainage line of the city has been encroached upon. When the city was planned during the British rule, slopes were made so that rainwater can find a natural outlet. But over time, these water outlets have either been blocked or the slopes are mindlessly concretised,‚Äù said Dr Sendil Kumar, a researcher on urban city planning at IIT Delhi.

He also said the city had expanded rapidly, but its drainage hadn‚Äôt. Another problem is civic apathy.

Every year, the monsoon exposes the claims of the Public Works Department (PWD), the three municipal corporations, and the New Delhi Municipal Council that the drains have been desilted.

‚ÄúBy June 15, all the arterial roads in our jurisdiction were repaired and the drains cleared. However, since many local roads that are maintained by the civic corporations connect with our roads, these get waterlogged,‚Äù said a PWD official.

Situated next to the national capital Delhi, the corporate hub of Gurgaon is home to the swanky offices of top multinational companies, hotels and malls. Yet Gurgaon, often described as India's 'millennium city' has been brought to a standstill since yesterday due to heavy rains.

As a result of the downpour on July 28, many Gurgaon roads have been waterlogged, causing massive traffic jams and leaving commuters stranded in their vehicles for up to seven hours.

Since Gurgaon is connected to several national highways, traffic moving towards the states of Rajasthan and Maharasthra was also affected. Local police has ordered the closure of schools on Friday and Saturday and also asked people from Delhi not to enter Gurgaon to avoid traffic jams. The flooding and traffic snarls started on July 28 and have continued today.

Splurge and save now! Click here

So, why does Delhi comes to standstill every time it rains? Here are five main reasons:

1. Blocked drains and lack of accountability: Every year ahead of the monsoon season, civic and road agencies claim clearing drains and delisting roads, promising a smooth drive. But one rain is all it takes for their claims to be washed away.

There are eight road-owning agencies in Delhi -- public works department (PWD), the three municipal corporations (east, south and north), New Delhi municipal council (NDMC), national highways authority of India (NHAI), department of irrigation and flood control and Delhi Cantonment.

But, they don‚Äôt have a common monsoon plan or an agency to monitor it. Take for instance desilting. Instead of clearing the drain and disposing the trash in landfills, the cleaners often leave the trash on the side which flows back and chokes the drain when it rains.

2. Poor road design: Several arterial roads have faulty slopes that do not allow rain water to recede naturally. Slip roads are designed poorly and flood easily. Roads in low-lying areas overflow as the drainage is poor.

While the number of vehicles has multiplied over the years, little has been done to improve the drainage system, which comes under pressure every time it rains heavily.

3. Unchecked construction: In many areas stormwater drains have been covered to build parking lots and extensions, which do not allow rain water to escape.

Green patches around trees and local parks act as natural sponge ‚Äì they absorb water and prevent water from accumulating. But these have been cemented in many parts of the city.

4. Disappearing storm drains: Many of the city‚Äôs 200-odd natural storm drains are ‚Äúmissing‚Äù, feared to have been filled up to build shops and parking lots, a 2015 survey revealed. Those that escaped construction are reduced to carrying domestic and industrial wastes. In the past, these drains would carry rain water to the Yamuna and guard the city against floods.

5. Poor traffic management: The first casualty of rains is the traffic signals. Traffic lights at many busy junctions go off as soon as it rains, causing jams. The traffic police are also short of hands. Against a strength of 5,500, only 1,200 personnel are out on the streets on a busy day.

delhi,2016,https://thewire.in/uncategorised/water-logged-cities-municipal-failure,02-Sep-16,Why Do Our Cities Flood? Collapse in Municipal Governance Is to Blame,"Regular flooding and water-logging in our cities indicate that the municipal administration and administrative coordination has collapsed.

Delhi and Gurugram were water-logged again on August 31. A hour of rain brought both cities to a grinding halt. This was not the first time such a situation had occurred; in fact it happens on regular basis. It seems that there is zero accountability and citizens continue to suffer because of the lackadaisical approach of the concerned authorities.

Every time, the blame game starts with no authority taking responsibility. In Delhi for instance, the government, the municipal corporation and the public works department continue to shift the blame onto each other.

One wonders why they can‚Äôt sit together to chalk out an integrated and coordinated plan to address the problems of flooding and water logging.

This year, similar flooding has been seen in Bhopal, Mumbai, Bangalore, Nashik and Chennai.

While there can be no control on rains, efforts need to be made to lessen the impact of flooding. In an ideal situation, when it rains, the street drains must keep a city from flooding. But for that, street drains have to be clean, and cleared of leaves and debris. It is the responsibility of the concerned municipal authorities to ensure that.

In many parts of the world, cities have adopted integrated storm water/flooding management plans to lessen and alleviate the problems resulting from water-logging and flooding.

Flood management plans

Flooding in cities is usually approached through the crisis management method. What we need is an integrated storm water/flooding management plan in each city, instead of the traditional storm water management planning. The former is a comprehensive, eco-system-based approach to rainwater management. It would provide direction for future development plans and identify infrastructural needs. The goal of such a plan would be to balance land use planning, storm-water engineering, flood and erosion protection, and environmental protection.

Traditional storm water management planning involves engineer-driven efforts and includes drainage systems, pipe and convey, and the protection of property. It is more reactionary and functions on unilateral decisions, local government ownership, extreme storm focus and peak flow thinking.

However, an integrated approach would be comprehensive and would be driven by interdisciplinary teams to include ecosystems, to prevent problems and protect property and habitats. It would mimic natural processes and function via consensus based decisions in partnership with citizens.

Lessons from the UK, Australia

In the UK and Australia different methods have been adopted to deal with severe flooding.

Temporary or ‚Äòdemountable‚Äô flood barriers have been erected to provide additional protection to flood-prone areas. Lightweight sectional metal barriers are relatively inexpensive and can be placed in various configurations and removed completely when waters recede. Frame barriers consist of rigid frames holding an impermeable membrane and use the weight of the floodwater itself to hold the barrier in place.

Natural flood management offers a sustainable approach to managing floods and is intended to complement traditional ‚Äòhard engineering‚Äô techniques, such as flood barriers and concrete walls. These schemes rely on a combination of small-scale interventions with the aim of reducing the speed in the flow of converging water before it reaches larger rivers. Natural flood defence features include small barriers in ditches and fields, or notches cut into embankments, all of which divert the water into open land. Letting pools form outside the main channel of the river means the water is temporarily removed from the main flow reducing the power of the floodwaters.

Trees can also help defend against floods. Planting more trees catches rainfall and helps to remove water from the soil. Large areas must be reforested to make a real difference. Felled trees can also be laid across streams in wooded areas and help push unusually high waters into surrounding woodlands, although such schemes need very careful planning and management.

Sustainable drainage is a concept often applied to towns and cities which are especially prone to flash flooding after sudden heavy rain. In urban areas, large areas of concrete and tarmac, as well as the roofs of buildings, are impermeable to water. Rain is channelled straight into drainage systems which can be quickly overwhelmed. Hence, builders could be asked to landscape developments, so that water from roofs and driveways seep into open ground rather than rushing into the water system. Sustainable drainage entails that impermeable surfaces should be replaced with permeable material, allowing rainwater to drain into the ground ‚Äì a process known as infiltration. Large ‚Äòdetention basins‚Äô can also be built to collect rainwater and hold it, managing the volume of water entering urban rivers, while ponds offer further water-holding capacity.

Role of municipal authorities

What we require is proactive action by municipal authorities to prevent the impact of flood.

Most important, is to keep the drainage system clean on regular basis. This allows water to be carried down fast. One of the major causes for flooding in our cities is that the drains are choked because of solid waste such as construction material, plastics and paper that are thrown in drains. Streets need to be kept clean. As rain-water rushes into the storm drains, it carries solid waste into the drains. Low lands should have storm drains so that water does not get accumulated there.

Rainwater harvesting needs to be encouraged. It would ensure rain water goes to the sub-soil, rather than straining the drainage system. The drains need to be de-silted before the onset of rains to prevent them from getting choked.

Afforestation should be encouraged. Planting trees helps in binding the loose soil and reduces the impact of flowing water.

Municipal bodies of our cities have to come out with consistent and coherent urban policy. Water-logging and flooding is as much a result of incoherent urban policy as it is of poor implementation. In the absence of a coherent urban policy, citizens would continue to suffer and be stranded in their vehicles for hours on a rainy day.

With streets turning into canals, boats have come to rescue the trapped locals who are apprehensive of situation similar to 1978 floods, when the two rivers had created havoc in the city.The level of water at all the three points i.e.Phaphamau, Chatnag and Naini, is far above the danger mark (84.734). Ganga, at Phaphamau, is flowing at 86.12 mts and at 85.42 mts at Chatnag while level of Yamuna at Naini bridge is 85.99 mts.Flood water have further entered localities like Ashok Nagar, Ganganagar, Rajapur, Mehndauri, Salori, Baghada, Daraganj, slums beneath the old Yamuna bridge, Baradari of Baluaghat, Gaus Nagar, Jogighat, Sadiyapur, areas near Sasur Khederi river etc. The flood water is touching the chachar nulla which houses the pump house, used for pumping the water logged streets.The intensity of the flood can be gauged by the fact that flood water has forced closure of several schools, including DPS (located at Arail side of Ganga) wherein flood water has entered the school premise. Likewise, several schools, located at flood affected localities, are also closed.With no power backup and streets disconnected for the past couple of days, people are taking out their costly belongings on the jeeps and trolley. ‚ÄúWith no boats from administration, we are forced to take the rented boats to take out our belongings‚Äù, said Shahabuddin, a resident of Gaus nagar.People of the flood affected areas are apprehensive and praying that the two rivers do not swell as much as that of 1978, when the two rivers had created havoc in the city, despite the fact much of the kacchar (catchment) was inhabited. ‚ÄúI still remember those days when I had passed from IERT and the entire city was flooded, but since then people have constructed houses in kacchar area, be it of Ashok nagar, Rajapur, Salori, Baghada, Daraganj, Bahargaon, Jogighat, Katehra, Lakhanpur, Karelabagh, etc and now they are facing the fury of floods‚Äù, said a senior official of the irrigation department.""The administration is to be blamed as where were the corrupt officials when these people were purchasing land in these areas and constructing their dream houses,"" said congress leader Parvez Akhtar Ansari.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
delhi,2016,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/a8herzL1neqG1YQ35Yj6RI/Floodplains-and-flash-floods.html,11-Aug-16,Floodplains and flash floods,"My first exposure to ‚Äúthe field"" as a budding administrator was during a ‚Äúvillage attachment"" in central Uttar Pradesh in northern India. The year was 1983. I still remember the name of the village, Chaturabehar, in Sitapur district. Every villager we met, owner cultivator to landless labourer, had the same woeful tale of collapsed houses and submerged crops to narrate.

Floods have long been a regular feature of life on the Indo-Gangetic plains. The administrative records of British India, however, indicate that the chief threat in these parts before the advent of canal irrigation was not floods but monsoon failure. Successive failures caused famine, disease and epidemics. Excessive rainfall caused short-term havoc with positive spin-offs.

My own research on the eastern reaches of the same vast floodplain on which Chaturabehar was located is illustrative. The rains in south Bihar were excessive in 1867, about 50% above the long-term average. Both the Ganga and Sone rivers were in spate, destroying the standing bhadoi crop. H.W. Alexander, collector of (erstwhile) Gaya district, noted that ‚Äúthe lands near the river sown with this crop are always liable to be flooded and are moreover sown with the full knowledge of this risk; should they escape a flood in any year, a full harvest is reaped; should they be destroyed, the land is rendered by the flooding more rich and fertile for the ensuing rubee (winter) crop. No crops could look finer than do the rubee crops now on the very lands which a few months ago were under water... thus the gains on the rubee almost compensate for the loss to the bhadoi."" The 60-day bhadoi was a bonus crop, grown in just 10% of the area, and when it was lost a better rice harvest ensued.

Two years later the Sone flooded again on 18 July, 1869, but receded within a few days, doing little damage to the bhadoi on the ground and improving ‚Äúthe land considerably by leaving behind it a mouldy deposit"".

Medieval Europe followed an extensive protocol of cyclical fallowing, the ‚Äúthree-field system"", under which only one-third of the cultivable area was actually available each year. The densely populated floodplains of northern India, on the other hand, were cultivated without fallowing and fertilizers year after year. Cow dung was mostly used as household fuel. Would this have been possible without these periodic mouldy river-borne deposits? The Indo-Gangetic plains are one of the most naturally fertile regions in the world, home to some of the oldest and densest human habitations.

The floods in Chaturabehar were however not caused by discharge from rivers swollen with bountiful monsoon precipitation. They were man-made. The flood waters could not recede because of water logging and seepage from the Sharda Canal which, along with the new all-weather road and rail embankments, now blocked the natural lines of drainage.

Commenting on the flood prone nature of the river Sone over a century earlier, J. McNamara, district engineer of the erstwhile Shahabad district (adjoining Gaya), felt that the construction of the East India Railway mainline had increased the frequency and intensity of floods. The track embankments tampered with the natural drainage of the country. The construction of the Shahabad canal created new obstructions. A new kind of fever which district officials called the ‚ÄúShahabad Fever"", soon became endemic in the area.

Something similar had happened in village Chaturabehar. British India civil servants had pointed to potential drainage problems while opposing the Sharda Canal scheme. Work on the canal began only after being shelved for half a century. Sub-soil saturation along the canal was more acute than in the western reaches of the Indo-Gangetic plain, where modern canals were first built in India. Chaturabehar was in the Awadh region, so plentifully supplied with water that the British called it the ‚ÄúGarden of India"".

What had once been a purely temporary flooding phenomenon of several hours, with beneficial spin-offs, now became a pervasive problem of water logging, breeding despair and disease. This also discouraged the kind of risk-taking and entrepreneurship in evidence in the Green Revolution western reaches of the Indo-Gangetic plain.

It is no coincidence that the oldest and most dense civilizations were all located on alluvial flood plains in Mesopotamia (Tigris-Euphrates), Egypt (Nile), China (Yellow River) and India (Indus-Ganga-Brahmaputra). Alluvium is a natural freshwater sink. Floods are the flip side of nature‚Äôs abundant bounty. Good drainage was always an issue. Before the emergence of big cities and modern development works, the flood waters were unimpeded, followed natural lines of drainage and receded seamlessly back into the river while recharging sub-surface aquifers and restoring soil fertility.

The drainage challenge in dense urban centres on the floodplains is more acute. Indian cities consequently need better drainage than their European counterparts. They need to evacuate large quantities of silt-laden flood waters, in addition to human sewage. The earliest urban centres in India, in the Indus Valley about five millennia ago, were global pioneers in constructing drainage and sewage systems. Mega European cities like Paris and London from early on built huge underground tunnels to evacuate large quantities of sewage generated by urban sprawls. Their Indian counterparts like Delhi and Kolkata do not have comparable underground sewage or drainage systems on this scale. Worse, extant water bodies and lines of drainage have been built over with concrete and asphalt. Delhi and Gurgaon now need just three hours of heavy rainfall to be flooded. The same narrative is repeated in Mumbai, Chennai and several other Indian cities.

And before the onset of monsoon this year, a total of 2549 hand-pumps in all the 21 districts were raised above the highest flood level (HFL), making it biggest self-sufficient potable water management for the flood-hit areas in the world.

‚ÄúNow, when floods sweep any village that has elevated hand pumps, the villagers can get potable water by reaching these hand pumps. But, they have to wade through the flood water or reach in boats. Most flood villages have a boat or two,‚Äù said Virendra Pandey, a flood activist in Bahraich.

In August and September, floods often attain severity in UP‚Äôs 21 flood prone districts. So now, when floods occur, villagers at least have access to drinking water.

Subsequently, the idea was also implemented by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Delhi.

What‚Äôs the idea?

Bhaggu, 69, of Sohras village in Kaiserganj district of Bahraich says: ‚ÄúSince the age of 5, I remember that Ghagra flooded my village every year and the government has been a mute spectator of our sufferings.‚Äù His main concern is the availability of drinking water during floods. ‚ÄúDuring floods, we have water everywhere, but not a drop of potable water. All wells, ponds, taps or hand pumps get submerged. When floods occur, government machinery or NGOs distribute food packets, tarpaulin, kerosene, match-boxes, but no one ever bothers to do something for drinking water.‚Äù

Dharmraj, 46, who holds the same view, says: ‚ÄúSo the villagers drink muddy water, either as it is or by sieving it through a cloth.‚Äù

This often resulted in outbreak of several water-borne diseases during the floods or as the floods receded. So, Rigzin Samphel, the then DM of Bahraich, ahead of the 2010 monsoon, began talking to villagers. An unidentified farmer sitting with folded hands suggested, ‚ÄúWhat if we raise existing hand-pumps from their ground level above HFL.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe idea looked appealing, and we realised that it did not require formulation of any new project but would only need elevation of the existing hand-pumps with minor funds,‚Äù said Samphel, who is now one of the officers in CM‚Äôs team.

The Economist magazine, in 2008, rated Samphel as one of the hardest working bureaucrats in the world. Soon after, the union rural development ministry awarded him for implementation of the rural employment scheme MGNREGA.

The district administration formed a team from Jal Nigam‚Äôs flood division. The engineers designed a prototype for elevated hand-pumps with a broad base to withstand flood water pressure. And in 4 months, drawing funds from the respective panchayats, raised 300 existing hand pumps in many villages above the HFL.

WhatsApp group for monitoring

When the CM‚Äôs ‚ÄòHand pumps‚Äô team comprising officers from Jal Nigam, Panchayat Raj, Rural Development and Rural Engineering Services began to work on it, they created a WhatsApp group of officers in all the 21 districts for day-to-day monitoring of the progress.

Engineer Utkarsh Shukla, the technical consultant for Ballia, wrote on the ‚ÄòHand pumps‚Äô WhatsApp: ‚ÄúAll the gram pradhans are so impressed with the project that they are doing elevation of existing hand pumps in non-flood zones as well.‚Äù

The north east monsoon rains under the influence of the low pressure in the Bay of Bengal last week came as a double shock to residents of Telangana‚Äôs capital. Having gone through harrowing days in the first week of September with heavy rain and flooding shutting schools for five days, the second shock was worse than expected. ‚ÄúWe were just returning to normalcy but these four days of thundershowers have been real mean,‚Äù said Alex Smith, an American consultant of an IT giant. Smith had come to Hyderabad to conduct a seminar for Java professionals last week.

KCR said that the illegal buildings on drains and tank beds needed to be cleared immediately to improve the brand image of Hyderabad as a global city. ‚ÄúWe will relocate all the poor living in such encroached land free of cost with double bedroom flats, but every illegal construction on nalas, tank beds etc will be demolished, come what may, and whoever it belongs to, whether politician, Minister or MLA,‚Äù said KCR, urging the media to back this campaign. ‚ÄúCitizens who provide information on violations will be suitably rewarded upto Rs 10,000,‚Äù he added.

Four platoons of the army and over 200 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel with boats and choppers have been deployed for rescue and relief operations. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and police are now identifying old buildings - there are an estimated 2,200 or so of them - and vacating them anticipating their collapse after days of waterlogging.

Hard times for Hyderabad

Flooding has occurred both due to overflowing drains and encroachment of nalas. The unprecedented downpour has turned the spotlight on the need to unclog drains all over the city. TRS leader and former employee of the GHMC V Srinivas Goud confessed in a TV debate last week, ‚ÄúWhat else can happen when 80 feet nalas were reduced to 8-10 feet with encroachments and rain water has nowhere to go but flood the streets?‚Äù

It was a Black Wednesday of sorts last week for the residents of Bhandari Layout, a colony of 50-odd multi-storeyed apartments with a population of 10,000 in Hyderabad‚Äôs northwestern Nizampet area. With the breach of the bund in the nearby Turka Chevuru, rain water entered the colony, which is allegedly built on a nala.

The GHMC and the police have already put in action a task force to assess the damage caused in Bhandari Layout, and to detail how many of these buildings are illegal in the first place. Panic-struck residents are refusing to leave their homes, afraid that they will be demolished after the rains. ‚ÄúWhy blame the flat owners now, what did the authorities do when they approved the layout and gave all permissions?‚Äù asks Rahul Kumar, an IT professional who bought a flat in Bhandari Layout in 2010.

As rain pounded the colony nonstop from Tuesday night until Friday, residents had to spend three nights without power, milk or drinking water as their roads, basements and in some cases, even the first floors of their buildings were flooded. Authorities shut down power supply to prevent electrocution. Irrigation Department officials said leakage and breach in the Turka Cheruvu bund had led to the submerging of areas downstream of Nizampet. ‚ÄúI have never seen such downpour or even water logging,‚Äù said Paladugu Parasuram, a builder and publisher who has lived in the area since 2007.

As many as 41 roads covering 120 km in the city were out of use due to waterlogging in Ameerpet, Banjara Hills, Panjagutta, Malakpet, Chadarghat, Musheerabad and Mytrivanam. ‚ÄúUnless water is drained out with heavy duty diesel motors and repaired, they cannot be used. But with the impending rains we cannot do anything right now,‚Äù said Disaster Management Assistant Commissioner K Badrinath. Water stagnating at many junctions for two days has made relief and rehabilitation a tough task. However, KCR dismisses media reports about damage to roads, claiming that only 10 percent of the city‚Äôs roads (which span 9,000 km), have been affected.

IT Hubs Hit

For the first time in two decades, the IT corridors of Madhapur and Gachibowli were also hit. Sixty-seventy percent of employees of IT companies were caught in traffic jams on Raidurgam-Gachibowli, Miyapur-Kondapur and other roads leading towards Hitech City and Gachibowli. IT and ITeS companies permitted their personnel to work from home on Friday as incessant rains and pothole-ridden roads deterred them from reaching their offices.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have power at home and basic supplies to stay indoors, so we decided to go to office and got caught up in traffic jams. What can we do at home, we don‚Äôt have cable network or power, and it is better to sit in office where authorities will provide us something,‚Äù said Arpita Kulkarni, an IT employee.

As rains are expected to continue for a few more days, IT companies are on tenterhooks and already have arrangements in place for Business Continuity Planning (BCP) which involves seeking help from other centres such as Visakhapatnam, Chennai, Pune and Bangalore to back them up if more rain hits. ‚ÄúThe writing on the wall is that a contingency strategy is essential for all Hyderabad-based 24x7 ITeS and IT units,‚Äù said the Society for Cyberabad Security Council (SCSC) in a statement.

The affecting of 4.5 lakh IT workers also hit eateries, shopping malls, multiplexes and recreational areas in Cyberabad and Hitech city as no one could venture out. At least 2,100 weddings have been cancelled as marriage halls were flooded. The GHMC and police have offered to help conduct weddings by opening a registrar‚Äôs office on a 24x7 basis.

It Has All Happened Before

To understand this year‚Äôs mess one needs to go back to the year 2000. Back then in August, rainfall was just 13 times the average in monsoon but caused flash floods in the Musheerabad nala as authorities released rainwater in the wee hours of the morning without prior notice from Hussein Sagar to avoid breaching of the tank bund. This led to waterlogging and rendered over 5000 people from poor families in 20 colonies of Gandhinagar and Ashok Nagar in Musheerabad homeless. ‚ÄúThe damage to life is less this year in view of GHMC‚Äôs preparedness for rains,‚Äù argued Musheerabad MLA and Home Minister Nayani Narasimha Reddy, who had criticised the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government at that time.

It could well have been a scene out of a horror film in 2000 - computers, household goods, cars and motorbikes floated in the flooded nala. People living in multi-storeyed apartments along the nala had to vacate their homes as rainwater entered even first-floor flats and stagnated for two days, and hundreds of families were left homeless. Then-Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu blamed the mess on officials who allowed buildings on drains, washing his hands of any responsibility.

Sixteen years later, the extent of damage to private and public property is much larger this time, though it is yet to be assessed. Chief Minister KCR said the La Nina effect was on this year leading to cooling of the earth, delaying the withdrawal of the North East Monsoon, which would last till 20th October. ‚ÄúSo brace up and be prepared for more rains and stop this blame game,‚Äù he warned Opposition parties and the media.

‚ÄúThe rains of the last four days were unprecedented in the last three decades. No infrastructure could handle such downpour. We received 16 cm of rain in a single day on 21st September, as against 32-40 cm throughout the year,‚Äù stated GHMC‚Äôs Deputy Commissioner P Saroja.

‚ÄúThe worst is not over yet,‚Äù warned YK Reddy, chief of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) at Hyderabad, who has issued a red alert warning that heavy to very heavy rains are likely to continue. ‚ÄúIt is the low depression in the Bay of Bengal that has driven the rains down south causing heavy downpour,‚Äù he said, adding that the La Nina effect had also kicked in.

Demoilition Drive

‚ÄúIt is common knowledge that Hyderabad has an aged drainage and sewerage system, with only 1,500 km of drain main canals and 2 lakh manholes, as against a requirement of 5,000 km of drain canals and 4 lakh manholes. Since the past six decades, nothing much has been done towards remodelling the drains,‚Äù said N Karthika Reddy, a retired GHMC engineer.

GHMC officials confess that successive governments failed to complete the remodelling and widening of storm water drains even 8 to 10 years after it was conceptualised, thanks to political instability and uncertainty in the state. Not even 50 percent of the required repairs of nalas have been done in the past five years due to ‚Äúseveral obstacles in carrying out the works,‚Äù according to a source, who added that several contractors have just given up following threats from those with political influence opposing the demolishing of structures needed to carry out the repairs.

Though under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) a sum of Rs 260 crore had been sanctioned for widening of four primary and 11 secondary nalas, and the contracts were awarded seven years ago, the GHMC has completed only 40 percent of the widening work.

The TRS government is now gearing up for a massive campaign against encroachments on tank beds and illegal buildings on drains. Like Naidu before him, KCR has blamed the flooding on past governments, accusing them of neglecting nalas and water bodies.

‚ÄúI assure you there will not be a single illegal building hereafter and I want the ministers, the GHMC and other agencies concerned to work in coordination and ensure that they do not permit any illegal building. If any one is permitted, it will be demolished mercilessly, however big its owner may be,‚Äù said the Chief Minister.

As early as 2015, KCR had launched a campaign against encroachments on irrigation tank beds, particularly in Hitech city. However, the exercise was dropped as it turned into a political campaign against Seemandhra industrialists and tycoons. Film actor Nagarjuna Akkineni had been caught in that web when his N-Convention centre in Hitech city, allegedly built on a tank bed, was issued show-cause notice, but a compromise was eventually reached.

KCR added that the Musi River, which at one point had an excellent drainage system, had been rendered ineffective due to the nearly 390 encroachments along its canals. The river was the artery of Hyderabad when the city was built four centuries ago, and its flooding in 1908 killed thousands, after which Visvesvaraya was sent by the British government to the Nizam of Hyderabad to remodel the system and build an effective bund. ‚ÄúWe are still enjoying the labours of Sir Visvesvaraya,‚Äù said KCR.

At a review meeting on Friday, Municipal Administration Minister KT Rama Rao said a five-member expert committee has been set up to prepare an action plan by 5th October on how to go ahead with razing illegal constructions, and the infrastructure and legal opinion needed on how to clear them. This is the third committee on encroachments since 2008. The Kirloskar Committee report, and that of a cabinet sub-committee set up by KCR after the formation of Telangana, are gathering dust with the government even today.

Rao also indicated that he had the Chief Minister‚Äôs endorsement to launch an action programme similar to that done in Bengaluru in August this year, in coordination with the courts and the police department. ‚ÄúI have discussed the issue with the Advocate General S Ramachandra Rao who says legal hurdles, if any, will be resolved,‚Äù he said.

KCR has announced that an internal assessment of the GHMC and Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority has already been made to remodel the drain system in Hyderabad, covering the entire area at a cost of Rs 29,000 crore. ‚ÄúWe will get loans and Government of India grants for the plan once it is ready,‚Äù he said. The government wants to launch this after the first phase of Metro Rail work is completed in the state capital by 2017, to avoid disruptions in road connectivity, he added. A sum of Rs 300-400 crore has been immediately made available to GHMC for repairs and other activities now, said the Chief Minister.

Following last week‚Äôs deluge, the GHMC is now claiming it has removed 775 encroachments out of 2,452 storm water drains in just one year. The GHMC mayor went on record stating that as many as 48 illegal constructions were demolished on Friday itself. This monsoon, 416 illegal buildings on nalas were demolished, and another 147 were demolished in September alone.

However, this is at best a drop in the ocean according to city-based environmentalist and campaigner for a better Hyderabad, Captain J Rama Rao. ‚ÄúWe never doubt the good intentions of our politicians, but the only thing is whether they will do it and when,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLet us hope this government will not wait until another deluge and take last week‚Äôs situation as a wake-up call. Otherwise it will not take long for Hyderabad to lose its lustre and glitter.‚Äù

A spectre, to misquote Karl Marx, it appears, is haunting India‚Äôs new urbanisation ‚Äî the spectre of agrarian pasts. In the last 15 years, it has repeatedly stalked Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Guwahati, Srinagar in the form of urban floods. Again, to take liberties with Marx, all the powers of politics, business and technology have apparently entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre ‚Äî recklessly code named as ‚Äúnature‚Äù. The code serves to absolvea us of guilt. We just need to build smartphone apps to give us early warnings of nature‚Äôs mischief. In the worst case scenario, we have the favourite whipping boys ‚Äî planners ‚Äî to take all the blame. Neither is nature autonomous from human action, nor is there any masterplan which is free from politics and corporate interest. The fault lies in forgetting our agricultural past and ignoring climate change. It took us centuries to develop the complex systems of values assigned to lands in the agrarian settlement. These values are based on soil conditions, gradient, location relative to other geographic and geological features such as ground water, surface water, drainage patterns etc. Lands were strategically exploited for production, left fallow to recover, left unoccupied to provide buffers against the cycles of excesses of nature. Urbanisation alters this agrarian imprint with new logics of efficiency and economy of service delivery. This is why cadastral maps of an agrarian settlement show fluid zigzag boundaries of property. After land use conversion for urbanisation, the boundaries change into rigid geometric patterns. New logics of revenue categories, new processes of record maintenance, reservation of land parcels for new purposes and installation of new infrastructure erase the agrarian birthmarks of land. Urban policy has, till now, remained oblivious to this dynamic.

New Delhi: The flood situation in Assam continues to be grim, leading the state assembly to suspend its budget session on Thursday for two days so that legislators are able to visit the affected areas to take stock of the situation and intensify the necessary relief and rescue operations.

According to a statement made by chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal in the assembly on Wednesday, the ongoing floods have so far claimed 12 lives and affected over 16 lakh affected people. The death toll rose to 13 on Thursday.

As per official statistics, more than 1.3 lakh people have been shifted to relief camps spread across the 21 districts of the state. The state administration has called in the army, and personnel from the national and state disaster response forces to assist the ongoing relief and rescue operations.

Sonowal‚Äôs constituency, the riverine island Majuli, is one of the worst affected. As per reports in the local media, over 1.2 lakh people residing in more than 150 villages of the island have been affected by the floods. As many as seven satras (the Vaishnava monasteries situated in the island) are reportedly submerged under water.

Surrounded by the Brahmaputra, Majuli faces floods every year. However, this time, the situation worsened as the surging river waters breached an embankment at Jugi Kaibarta Gaon in the Bongaon area of upper Majuli on Tuesday. The fast flowing waters thereafter submerged as many as 12 villages around the area, threatening to inundate nearly half of the island. Though houses have been swept away by the river waters, no lives have been lost.

Ranoj Pegu, the chief executive member of the Mishing Autonomous Council ‚Äî the administrative body that covers Mishing-dominated Majuli ‚Äî told this correspondent from the island, ‚ÄúThe embankment near Bongaon broke after many years. Thankfully, two factors saved the situation from getting out of hand. One, the rising level of the river waters began showing signs of receding from Wednesday afternoon and two, the area around Bongaon is comparatively higher than the rest of the island, so the water didn‚Äôt flow into the other areas.‚Äù

The flood situation in the island took a dangerous turn in 2012 too when the Brahmaputra breached yet another embankment in the Sonowal Kachari area of Kamalabari-Gegera dyke in upper Majuli.

Sonowal, who visited the affected areas of Majuli on Thursday morning, promised ‚Äúimmediate steps to reconstruct the embankment breached by the floodwaters.‚Äù He told local TV channels, ‚ÄúI have instructed the deputy commissioner and the sub divisional officer to provide adequate relief to the marooned villagers. My government‚Äôs priority is to provide immediate relief to the affected. The central government has assured us all possible help.‚Äù

The ferry service to the island from Neematighat, which was suspended on July 23 as the water level went above the danger mark, resumed on Wednesday following an improvement in the situation.

Media reports quoted Jorhat district deputy commissioner Virender Mittal as saying 13 relief camps have been set up by the administration on the island. He said, ‚ÄúThe government officials are distributing relief materials to the victims. Any official found neglecting duty during floods will face action under Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Assam Disaster Management Manual, 2015.‚Äù

The chief minister, accompanied by the state water resources minister Keshab Mahanta and minister of state Naba Doley, also visited other flood affected areas of the Jorhat district on Thursday besides visiting the affected areas in Bokakhat in the neighbouring Golaghat district. The Brahmaputra breached the embankment in Dergaon in Golaghat district, which worsened the flood situation in the areas around it.

The Kaziranga National Park (KNP), half of which falls in the Golaghat district, is also inundated by the flood waters, leading to the death and displacement of the animals, including the park‚Äôs prized possession, the one-horned rhinos. On July 25, the park authorities recovered the carcass of a rhino from the Agartoli range. So far, more than 18 deer have been killed by the flood waters.

Speaking to The Wire, the district forest officer of KNP, Subhasis Das, said, ‚ÄúIn the last four days, we recovered the carcass of three calves besides that of a rhino and rescued seven calves.‚Äù

‚ÄúThough the water level is beginning to come down since yesterday, the animals are continuing to migrate out of the park areas,‚Äù he added.

Meanwhile, the BJP‚Äôs Lok Sabha member from the state Ram Prasad Sarmah wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday requesting him to send a central team to take stock of the situation and also ‚Äúannounce a Rs 1000 crore relief package for the state to deal with the flood situation.‚Äù He said in the letter, ‚ÄúThis year (the flood situation) is the worst in the last 30 years. I urge the Union Government to take immediate steps to send more NDRF teams to Assam and declare Assam flood as a national problem.‚Äù",flood,2019 Assam floods,"Assam, India","July 23, 2019","August 1, 2019","['Majuli', 'Jorhat', 'Golaghat', 'Kaziranga National Park']","['200 mm in 24 hours in Majuli', '150 mm in 24 hours in Jorhat', '100 mm in 24 hours in Golaghat']","['13 deaths', '1.3 lakh people evacuated', '7 satras submerged', 'over 18 deer killed', 'rhino carcass recovered']",,"['disruption of transport', 'damage to crops', 'loss of livestock']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

In a flash, the floodwaters emptied the village. Residents who had seen it coming left for higher ground ‚Äì everyone except Uma Sahu (name changed) and her two-year-old son.

By the time Sahu realised what had happened, water was girdling the legs of her charpai (cot). With her son strapped to her breasts and floodwaters inching towards her, even moving to the relative safety of the roof was perilous. Her husband, a migrant worker, was away at a construction site in Delhi.

With nowhere to go and no help at hand, Sahu stood for 12 hours in chest-high water, with her child in her arms. When the sun was making its way to a watery horizon, it was a miracle in the form of a boat that saved mother and child that day.

Untold stories

But Punita Yadav (name changed) didn‚Äôt have the same luck. When a flash flood swept through Baiju Bhagatkatola, a few miles west of Sahu‚Äôs village, the entire family moved to the roof of the house. Tired and deep in sleep, no one noticed when her five-year-old son slid off the roof and fell into the floodwater. His body was never recovered.

Such heart-breaking stories of loss are an undercurrent to the tales of adaptation and resilience on the flood plains of Gandak River in Bihar‚Äôs West Champaran district. In the absence of state support, luck is often the only thing between life and death.

For women, being married into families living in this floodplains is akin to being wedded to impermanence. ‚ÄúKua mein dakheldiya‚Äù (we have been pushed into a well) is a common refrain among those who have moved to these low-lying and flood-prone areas, locally known as diara.

In these harsh landscapes, these women have had to survive floods, dacoits on the run, crop attacks from wild animals and disease. There is little surprise that the silt-enriched soil of the diara harbours productivity and resentment.

Parul Devi‚Äôs (name changed) first tryst with floods draws a toothy grin from her mother-in-law. Marriage brought her from West Bengal to Bariarpur village in West Champaran. The sight of water gushing into her room put her in a state of shock.

‚ÄúI put my storage chest on top of my bed and perched myself on it, refusing to come down,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt took a lot of effort to get me off the bed and join my family on the roof.‚Äù

Tough lessons

Women who come to the floodplains of Bihar after marriage often have to hit the ground running, with little time to prepare for a life always under the threat of a deluge.

From keeping food grains dry to climbing onto roofs, preparing food on a makeshift kitchen and protecting children from disease and death, there is a lot to learn. The toughest, most women said, is learning how to relieve oneself. With no dry ground in sight, most of them bashfully admit, there are only two ways to cope ‚Äì either stop eating or eat as less as possible.

‚ÄúIf the government could only tell us in advance about an approaching flood, we wouldn‚Äôt be stranded in water every year,‚Äù said Ganga Saini from Telua village in West Champaran.

No assistance

However, her plea does not find a place in flood policy in India. In a world obsessed with big data, flood alerts deliver information in its sparest form to the poor.

Through the scratchy noise of old transistor sets, people get to hear how many cubic centimetres of water have been released from the Gandak barrage upstream. Then, it is up to the villagers to figure out if the water will enter their village, and how high it will reach. The state reaches out the people only through the safe distance of the long wave radio.

This information gets amplified and circulated in the male-dominated space of newspapers, radio and television. Women are mostly caught unawares, unless the male member of the family brings such news home. Rural Bihar, in the last decade, has been steadily emptied of men as they migrate out of the state to look for work.

This has left women more vulnerable to not receiving flood alerts on time. Many women, like Sahu, find themselves at greater risk if they have small children or are pregnant. Reaching the orbit of Mars has proved easier than sending an advanced flood alert to a woman in rural India.

Finding a way out

Being on the blind side of the state has led women in the Gandak river basin to find their own solutions. Mobile phones have allowed some freedom from an insulated world. In 2013, Dalit women in Navrahi village in West Champaran used their mobile phones to contact boatmen to arrange for a pick up. They also stored the phone number of local doctors to come to the aid of those who were pregnant or sick.

This left the older women in the village awestruck. ‚ÄúEarlier, we made makeshift stretchers using saris and bamboo and carried pregnant women out of the village,‚Äù one of them said. ‚ÄúNow with the mobile phone, the boatman was instructed to bring the doctor to the doorstep. How times have changed‚Äù.

Times are indeed changing, but very slowly. This year, floods have claimed 89 lives in Bihar so far. The river has breached its banks again this month and submerged 800 houses in the Gandak river basin. Behind each submerged house is a story of struggle and loss.

Such narratives will not spill over into national discourse. As national news gets flooded with footage of waterlogging, traffic jams and woes of the urban rich in Delhi and Gurugram, women on Gandak‚Äôs floodplains brace for another year of apathy and obscurity.

Till Tuesday, nearly 10 lakh people were affected by the floods across 804 villages in 19 districts.

The death toll in the current wave of floods stood at 34 across the state.

The affected districts are Lakhimpur, Jorhat, Golaghat, Bongaigaon, Dhemaji, Dhubri, Morigaon, Kokrajhar, Dibrugarh, Biswanath, Nagaon, South Kamrup and Goalpara.

Among them, Dhubri is the worst affected with nearly five lakh people still suffering, followed by Barpeta with almost one lakh and Goalpara with 86,000 people currently hit by the floods, the ASDMA said.

Authorities are running 118 relief camps and distribution centres, where 23,405 people are taking shelter across 11 districts.

Over 20,000 hectares of crop area are still under flood waters across the state, besides washing away number of roads, embankments, bridges and other infrastructure.

Currently, Brahmaputra is flowing above the danger mark at Nematighat in Jorhat and Dhubri town.

Meanwhile, state industry minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said at a press conference that the government has Rs 654 crore under SDRF, out of which Rs 47.53 crore has been released to the districts for flood relief and rehabilitation measures this year.

He said the government will soon start working on strengthening of the embankments.

In Chennai, the oppressive heat currently gripping the southern Indian city has led to workers demanding an allowance for working in stifling factories and vets offering advice on caring for pets to avoid dehydration. ‚ÄúWhile some rains would have been a blessing in disguise, the rain gods have ditched Chennai,‚Äù writes a reporter for Skymet, which provides weather forecasts in India.

It would have been hard to imagine such a situation four-and-a-half months ago. Following the heaviest rainfall in more than a century at the end of last November, the Adyar river ‚Äì which runs through the centre of Chennai ‚Äì surged, causing muddy water to pour over the walls of nearby apartment blocks and into the streets. Thousands were forced to flee their homes, and hundreds died.

Businesses were also affected. Factories such as those of Ford and Renault-Nissan were closed, Chennai International airport suspended operations, power supplies were down and roads across the region became waterlogged, limiting the movement of goods and employees. Reinsurance company Swiss Re estimates the floods caused economic losses of $2.2bn (¬£1.53bn).

Despite high levels of economic growth, India lags significantly behind countries such as the US and China in building resilience to natural hazards, which cost it $9.8bn a year. This is the conclusion of risk analysis company Verisk Maplecroft, whose latest hazard risk indices have ranked India‚Äôs population first in a list of those most exposed to natural hazards.

The research identifies flooding as one of the biggest risks to communities and businesses in South Asia, and suggests that in India alone 113 million people ‚Äì 9% of the population ‚Äì are acutely exposed to flood hazard.

The reasons why India is so exposed are diverse. ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs most vulnerable areas are characterised by high rates of poverty and poor access to public services, leaving people with a lack of resources to prepare for and recover from natural hazard events,‚Äù says Dr Richard Hewston, principal environmental analyst at Verisk Maplecroft. ‚ÄúCommunities in rapidly growing urban areas also tend to be among the most vulnerable, as poor urban planning and weak enforcement of building standards means the impacts of natural hazard events are more keenly felt.‚Äù

In addition, the country‚Äôs dependence on agriculture leaves it highly sensitive to extreme weather events. India derives a greater proportion of GDP (17%) from agriculture than the global average (4%) and the sector employs 47.2% of the population, compared to the global average of 30.7%.

The Indian government has begun to address these vulnerabilities, introducing a $1.3bn crop insurance scheme at the start of this year to help farmers cope with falling market prices and crop failure due to natural disasters. At present only 19% of India‚Äôs farmers insure their crops due to lack of awareness about the practice of crop insurance, its cost and lack of availability.

Insurance companies themselves could encourage more resilient business practices, for example by offering products that support the adoption of drip irrigation.

‚ÄúIt is impossible for insurance companies in India not to notice the risks of extreme weather and water scarcity,‚Äù says Alejandro Litovsky, CEO and founder of Earth Security Group, which has recently published a report on the role of the insurance sector in India. ‚ÄúBesides their agricultural portfolios, their clients in energy and infrastructure are also being affected as droughts cripple their operations. There is a powerful business case for insurance companies to plan their future growth through companies promoting sustainable agriculture and renewable energy.‚Äù

Ultimately, tackling unsustainable business practices requires more than insurance. The Delhi-based Energy and Resources Institute proposed to work with companies to study the impact of climate change on the oil and gas sector. So far, however, only two have signed up to take part. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre concerned about numbers for demand of their product, but not about what the climate can do to their business. Everyone‚Äôs knowledge is based on hindsight,‚Äù says a researcher from the institute who wished to remain anonymous.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
delhi,2016,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/floods-civic-decay-sink-gurugram-bengaluru/article64312614.ece,29-Jul-16,"Floods, civic decay sink Gurugram, Bengaluru","Heavy monsoon rains exposed the glaring inadequacies of urban planning and civic maintenance, leading to severe water-logging in at least two of India‚Äôs top tech cities ‚Äì‚Äì Gurugram and Bengaluru ‚Äì‚Äì which disrupted economic activity, caused miles-long traffic gridlocks, and threw normal life out of gear on Friday.

Other parts of India ‚Äì‚Äì from Bihar to Uttar Pradesh to Assam to Arunachal Pradesh ‚Äì‚Äì also experienced heavy rains and floods, which claimed the lives of humans as well as animals, including Assam‚Äôs famed rhinos.

So severe was the flood and traffic situation in the Gurugram-Manesar belt on NH8, where most automobile companies ‚Äì‚Äì including Maruti Suzuki India, Hero MotoCorp and Honda Motorcycle ‚Äì‚Äì have factories that authorities imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC near the Hero Honda Chowk, and issued an advisory to people to avoid Gurugram.

Minister of Road Transport, Highways & Shipping Nitin Gadkari asked NHAI Chairman Raghav Chandra to rush officers to Gurugram to take steps to restore traffic flow on NH8.

All schools in Gurugram were directed to remain closed due to risks from open manholes and potholes.

‚ÄúBecause of traffic jams, especially on NH8, factories in Gurugram, Manesar, Dharuhera and Bawal are affected,‚Äù Kuldeep Jhanghu, General Secretary, Maruti Udyog Kaamgar Union, said. Many employees reporting for duty in the factories were stuck for hours, he added.

However, a Maruti spokesperson told BusinessLine that the company‚Äôs factories in Gurugram and Manesar were running fine and there was no impact on production. ‚ÄúThere was some stress in the morning, but it was sorted out by noon,‚Äù he added.

In Bengaluru, heavy rains ‚Äì‚Äì up to 41.8 mm in 24 hours ‚Äì‚Äì caused lakes to breach and left entire residential and commercial neighbourhoods flooded. The worst-affected areas were in the southern and eastern parts of the city; many parts of Hongasandra and HSR Layout too were flooded. Major arterial roads, including Old Madras Road, Hosur Road, Outer Ring Road, Bannerghatta Road and Ballari Road witnessed severe traffic snarls.

Veerasandra Junction and the NICE Road junction were inundated, throwing traffic on the IT corridor hopelessly out of gear. Small industrial units and garment industrial units in the Bommasandra Industrial Area were particularly affected.

The floods glaringly exposed the underbelly of India‚Äôs cities: the absence of planning and civic maintenance. ‚ÄúThe floods show up what is wrong with Gurugram, which is an accidental city,‚Äù said Rajiv Bhakat, Partner, Studio Code, a Delhi-based architecture firm. ‚ÄúIn the absence of government planning, private players developed land, colonies and buildings for years.‚Äù But the limitations of infrastructure were starkly manifest, he added.

‚ÄúHaryana must plan and execute rapid and massive infrastructural upgrades for Gurugram, a high-revenue generator for the State,‚Äù Bhakat added.

According to Dikshu C Kukreja, Managing Director and Principal Architect at CP Kukreja Associates, ‚ÄúThe solution is very simple: GIS mapping of underground utility lines; establishment of a single agency with responsibility for coordination between all agencies laying underground utility such as water supply, sewer, stormwater, piped gas, telephone, electric cables, and proper desilting of drains in a time-bound manner.‚Äù .

In Bengaluru, too, civic experts blamed the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) and the BBMP for the poor state of infrastructure on the city‚Äôs outskirts.

BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, who toured the affected areas on Friday, said, ‚ÄúOur priority is to move residents from low-lying areas to safe places, after which stormwater drains will be widened to clear water-logging.‚Äù The problem, he added, had been compounded by the fact that five lakes are interlinked.

However, former World Bank Transportation Planner Arun Mokashi said it would be impossible to predict the extent of water-logging triggered by a very heavy rainfall. ‚ÄúUrban and transportation planners cannot design their systems for unprecedented rainfall,‚Äù he said.

Mokashi, who has worked for a number of multilateral agencies, pointed out that in cities such as Mumbai, citizens have learned to live with days of heavy rains, when all civic systems get paralysed. In particular, the city‚Äôs experience of the 2005 floods has made everyone cautious.

Architect and urban housing expert Chandrashekhar Prabhu said that cities such as Gurugram and Mumbai are ‚Äúnothing but villages‚Äù bursting at the seams.

‚ÄúThere is no urban planning in Gurugram. Rampant urbanisation, failure to clear stormwater drains and corruption of local civic officials have added to the cities‚Äô woes,‚Äù he said.

Prabhu alleged that real estate developers are only interested in constructing buildings unmindful of the impact on the ecosystem.

Across the country, Development Control (DC) rules make it compulsory for real estate developers to design systems to help water percolate into the ground. But politicians have ensured that such systems are never incorporated in the DC rules, he said.

Unfortunately, the network suffers from complete neglect. In many places it has become a smelly sewer, in others it has been overrun by squatters. Since no one cares for them, they are easily hijacked for other purposes like car parks and roads. Municipal authorities claim that drains continue to flow under the new construction but they are difficult to clean and get quickly clogged with garbage. It is not surprising, therefore, that even a moderate shower floods the roads.

A similar story can be told of other Indian cities: The traditional water tanks of Bengaluru, Mithi river in Mumbai, the Adyar catchment in Chennai. The Noyyal is marked as a perennial river in 19th century maps of Coimbatore but is now a sewer. Varanasi derives its name from two streams ‚Äî Varuna and Asi. The former is still a discernible river but Asi is now a municipal drain. Many locals who live along its banks were surprised when I pointed out its course.

Read | Why Kolkata sank in just three hours of rain

The maintenance of the drainage networks is critical for avoiding repeated floods but they are also a solution to another major problem faced by Indian cities ‚Äì the lack of walking and cycling paths. A critical flaw in public transport systems across India is first/last mile connectivity. In all other countries, this is usually walked but in India one is forced to haggle with a rickshaw even for a short distance.

A nullah network, by its nature, is made of long stretches of land. In fact, for historical reasons, the nullahs usually run close to the oldest and densest neighborhoods and are often the only open space cutting through the landscape. Rather than covering them up, walking paths should be build along the open nullahs. This would have the additional benefit of increasing public pressure to keeping the nullahs clean as people would be walking along them. Rastogi estimates that Delhi can have a first class walking/cycling network and a workable drainage network for a fraction of the money being currently spent on large, centralised sewage treatment plants.

The dual use of water networks as walking paths is not uncommon across the world. Many Western cities use paths along water-bodies as walkways and several Asian cities have adopted this model in recent years.

Till the 1970s, Singapore river was a foul smelling stream that took in industrial discharge as well as waste from hawkers and squatters. In 1977, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew put a target that it would be possible to eat fish from the river in 10 years time. Over the next few years, thousands of hawkers and squatters were relocated while industrial discharge was diverted to sewage treatment plants. By 1984, the river was clean enough for the government to organise a ‚Äúmass-swim‚Äù that included senior government officials. Today, the old riverside warehouses of Boat Quay and Clarke Quay are among the most visited tourist sites in Asia.

Cheonggyecheon stream in Seoul is another example of watershed restoration as urban renewal strategy. In the 1950s, the stream had become a smelly drain carrying industrial and household sewage. An elevated highway was build over it in 1968. However, in 2003, the local mayor decided to pull down the highway and restore 7 km of the stream. The stretch is now the centerpiece of the city and 80,000 people use it everyday.

In an automobile obsessed age, we think of roads as the arteries of the city, but it is really drainage networks that should play this part. They are not merely to ensure that roads do not get flooded after a downpour but are an organic part of the city as green lungs, water-table recharge, public transport, waste management, and spaces for leisure. Other Asian cities have come to recognise this in recent years and it is time we did too.

The horror of Chennai floods was still fresh in the mind when severe flooding crippled the millennium city of Gurugram and struck Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. Rain for only two hours paralysed life in glittering Gurugram, with knee-deep waterlogging forcing authorities to shut down schools and offices declaring a holiday. It is a reality of unsustainable urban development that population growth and visionless race for infrastructure is disturbing the natural equilibrium and worsening quality of life for urban residents.

Master plans have failed in our country because they are rigid, obsolete and unable to cope with the pace of growth of Indian cities. Traditionally, colonies and residential areas have been the unit of micro-level planning within city limits. Planning has focussed on providing civic amenities like water supply, electricity, road connectivity and sewage facilities to residents of an area. In cities like Gurugram, the focus of water supply schemes has been to lay down pipelines, import water from outside city limits and supply it to residents.

While this is a convenient approach to solve water scarcity within the city, it increases dependence on natural resources outside the city or state jurisdiction and increases vulnerability by limiting the scope of management only to supply and not to availability of water.

Moreover, the approach of laying sewage lines to expand coverage only, disturbs the natural drainage patterns of a city and increases the incidence of waterlogging. Lack of a regional planning approach has led to haphazard proliferation of slums and other urban problems.

A watershed is a geo-hydrological unit comprising all land and water within the confines of a drainage divide. Firojpur Jhirka-Delhi ridge forms the western boundary and Delhi ridge forms the eastern boundary of such a watershed. These hills are the northern continuation of the Aravalli hills. The natural drainage pattern of the city comprises large depressions and streams, tending to converge inland instead of flowing into Yamuna. A delineation of watersheds in Gurugram district, indicate the distribution of Gurugram urban into six micro-watersheds, five of which flow northwards to Delhi. Delhi-Jaipur expressway crosses these micro-watersheds almost in the middle, and blocks the natural drainage pattern from south to north.

Adopting a watershed approach to micro-level planning in a city reduces its dependence on imported natural resources like water from outside the city limits, and also mitigates the risks of extreme weather events. While increasing the potential for water conservation options like rainwater harvesting and aquifer recharge, it is useful in efficient drainage and storm water management.

It is more important to incorporate the watershed approach within city development plans itself, especially in siting of residential colonies and other facilities. This will increase the availability of water for residential areas while reducing energy consumption in transporting water to upstream locations. It will also lead to reduction in financial expenditure for laying the pipelines.

While it is not possible to relocate the existing infrastructure of cities like Gurugram, municipal authorities should reassess the drainage network especially along the roads and highways in the context of natural drainage pattern within the micro-watershed. Locality-wise sink hole/ depressions need to be identified, and lift systems should be installed at these places for transferring water. NDMA through its guidelines for management of urban flooding, published in 2010, also recognises the significance of this approach. However, it hasn‚Äôt found salience in urban development discussions among authorities.

As climate change is reality now heavy precipitation events are likely to increase. This requires city authorities to adopt an integrated watershed based approach for better adaptation of their population.

The watershed approach is being adopted across the cities of the world. The City Concept Plan of Singapore had the provision of satellite towns development around the central water catchment area. Louisville-Jefferson county in the US have stormwater master management plans. In India this approach has been applied to village level development planning. But cities too need this approach, if they are to be ‚Äòsmart‚Äô.

Swarup stated that the media reports regarding release of water from Farakka Barrage contributing to floods in Bangladesh are ‚Äúerroneous and misleading‚Äù.

The Farakka barrage gates remain open during the monsoon for smooth passage of flows of Ganga river which is a routine and unavoidable activity, he said.

In accordance with the standing arrangement between India and Bangladesh, flood alerts during the monsoon season are communicated for Farakka and Sahibganj sites by field offices of Central Water Commission of India to their Bangladesh counterparts.

Being a routine procedure no special intimation or alert regarding opening of gates is issued.

‚ÄúMy bamboo and banana plants, which sustain my family of four, are all gone. I don‚Äôt have any land now. We can‚Äôt continue living like this,‚Äù he said.

A few hundred metres away, Gereli Das is also building her new residence with wood and bamboo. She, her husband and daughter are among dozens who lost their lands to erosion and were forced to shift this monsoon.

‚ÄúWe survive by planting rice and paddy. But this year we cannot cultivate paddy as all our land is gone,‚Äù said the 60-year-old, who has shifted her house twice in the past six years.

Floods and erosion are not new to Majuli. From 1246 sq km in 1971, it has shrunk to 650 sq km at present. The island and the cluster of islets near it, is still significant ‚Äì 80 km long and 15 km wide.

The island itself shapes and reshapes with each floods, land mass eroded at one end is deposited elsewhere.

Of the 248 villages on the island, 166 have been earmarked as threatened. Since 2001, more than 3,000 families have lost their land to erosion and were forced to relocate. Embankments are still home to more than 2,000 families.

Majuli, the hub of neo-Vaishnavite culture and spirituality, spread by 15th century social-reformer Sankardev, also face problems of connectivity and infrastructure.

It can be reached only by ferries and boats during the day, the condition of roads is poor and the 100-bed sub-divisional hospital lacks specialists. There is no major educational institution or avenues for employment.

But the floods also make the island a farmers‚Äô delight.

The nutrient-rich sediments deposited on the banks of Brahmaputra make Majuli a very fertile place, favourable for agriculture for the 170,000-odd residents.

Transformation plans

But the island‚Äôs fate could change soon. The BJP-led governments in New Delhi and Dispur have launched a spate of plans and projects to transform Majuli through flood and erosion control measures.

On Thursday, a week after the island was declared the largest river island by the Guinness Book of World Records, the Assam government upgraded Majuli‚Äôs status from a sub-division to the state‚Äôs 35th district.

New chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who represents the island constituency in the state assembly, held a cabinet meeting in Majuli and announced the government‚Äôs determination to protect and develop it.

The cabinet decided to set up a centre for water resources to tackle floods and erosion. Construction of concrete roads all over the island was another decision taken at the meeting.

A cultural university and a post-graduate college are part of the state government‚Äôs Rs 1200-crore package for Majuli.

Talks are also on with World Bank and Asian Development Bank to fund an ambitious project to dredge the Brahmaputra and its tributaries and remove silt deposit which in turn would control flood and erosion.

‚ÄúConstruction of embankments, geo bags and tubes at erosion-prone areas and planting of grass with long roots, would control loss of land,‚Äù said Narsing Pawar, the island‚Äôs sub-divisional officer.

The Union government has already announced the construction of two bridges connecting two separate banks of the island. Also, a 121-km long national highway will be constructed to connect Majuli with two major towns ‚Äî Jorhat and Lakhimpur.

The plans, when implemented, are expected to make access to Majuli much easier and bring tourists from within India and abroad to witness the island‚Äôs pristine beauty and also experience its art, culture and spirituality.

Preserving unique identity

Residents of Majuli, comprising mostly scheduled tribes and scheduled castes, are excited at the attention their island is getting at present. But there is also fear that connectivity and development may lead to the island losing its unique identity.

The ‚Äòsatras‚Äô ‚Äî Vasihnavite monasteries ‚Äî whose numbers have reduced from 65 to 32 due to erosion, still practice and preach the plays, dances and spiritual ways professed by Sankardev over 500 years ago.

There is apprehension that unbridled rush of people from other areas could affect these practices which have remained unchanged for centuries.

‚ÄúConnectivity has both positive and negative aspects. Majuli‚Äôs natural beauty and culture could get affected and we might end up like any other place,‚Äù said Hem Chandra Goswami, religious and administrative head of Samaguri ‚Äòsatra‚Äô, one of the biggest monasteries in the island.

Some feel lifestyles of the Mishing and Sonowal-Kachari tribals, who are dependent on the island‚Äôs soil and water resources, could get affected once Majuli is ‚Äútransformed‚Äù.

Sonowal and his team has the task of ensuring that the likes of Bhakatram and Gereli get permanent addresses and there is controlled development while keeping Majuli‚Äôs culture and spirituality unadulterated.

Highlighting the State‚Äôs lack of preparedness and functional ‚Äòparalysis‚Äô in the face of the massive tragedy in the form of flash floods that struck Kedarnath in 2013, the Uttarakhand High Court has issued mandatory directives to the State to deal with such exigencies and also to maintain the ecological sanctity of the area.

Among other things, the court has directed the State to form five special teams to trace the dead still buried under the rubble.

A division bench comprising Justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice Alok Singh held that the issue was of ‚Äògreat public importance‚Äô and deliberated on failure of state machinery to deal with the disaster while referring to delayed rescue operations that increased the miseries manifold.

The court held, ‚ÄòThe State machinery was paralyzed. It never rose to the occasion. The rescue operations were delayed, which further compounded the miseries of the helpless people trapped in the area. The State should have managed the disaster effectively and properly by involving all the agencies like Army, Air Force, National Disaster Relief Force, Paramilitary Forces and local Police at the earliest.‚Äô

The directions came on a petition by Mr. Ajay Gautam, highlighting the miseries of the people trapped in Kedarnath valley in June, 2013, the month when the area received an unprecedented heavy rainfall leading to a monumental loss of life and property.

The bench issued the following time-bound directives to ensure disaster preparedness and also preserving the ecological balance of the area:



The court directed the state to constitute five special investigation teams headed by an officer not below the rank of S.S.P. and comprising of officers drawn from the National Disaster Relief Force, police force, paramilitary forces and local police to trace the dead bodies, lying scattered/buried in the Kedarnath area. The teams shall prepare the DNA profile and inform the family members of the deceased. The State Government after completing all codal formalities shall perform the last rites as per Hindu, Sikh, Christian and Muslim religion.





In order to check un-authorised and haphazard construction in the area, the State Government is directed to prepare the development/master plans for the areas falling enroute to Char Dham, including for Devprayag, Sonprayag, Rishikesh, Badrinath, Rudraprayag, Gopeshwar within six months.





The state has been issued stipulations with respect to management of influx of tourists and pilgrims in the area. The court said the state shall prepare a National Code of Tourism and Pilgrims on the analogy of Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra and also take steps to put restrictions on mass tourism in eco-sensitive zones, in order to save the glaciers. The State Government is directed to frame the rules to regulate the mass movement of pilgrims to religious places in the State of Uttarakhand. And also maintain biometrics data of all the tourists/pilgrims by installing biometrics machines. The State Government is also directed to construct sufficient number of inns/sarais to house the pilgrims at a distance of every 10 km enroute Char Dhams and Hemkund Sahib.





With respect to implementation of rules under the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, district magistrates have been made responsible for ensuring adherence in their respective territories. Municipal Councils Devprayag, Sonprayag, Rishikesh, Badrinath, Rudraprayag, Gopeshwar, Rudrapur have to ensure the scientific disposal of the municipal wastes and that no untreated sewage is discharged in the rivers enroute to chardhams as well as Hemkund Saheb. The court also asserted that if the orders are not carried out within 6 months, district magistrates of the concerned districts shall be liable to face the contempt proceedings.





The State Government is also directed to install advanced Warning Systems in Char Dham areas, including doppler weather radar, automatic weather station (aws), radiosonde /rawinsonde, within three months.





The court also stated that all the roads leading to Char Dhams should be metalled and it shall be the responsibility of the chief engineer to maintain the roads. The State Government is also directed to construct shrines between Govind Ghat and Govind Dham.





In view of any such future eventuality, the court has directed the State to construct emergency stores at safer and suitable places enroute to char-dhams and Hemkund Sahib at a distance of 10 km each. The stores shall be equipped with blankets, sheets, ration, gas, water, condensed milk in sufficient quantity. The State Disaster Rescue Force should be deployed in these stores throughout day and night at the time of Yatras.





The court has further directed the Public Works Department (PWD) to deploy latest machinery in the area to maintain the roads and to clear the roads immediately in case of any natural calamity during Yatras. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) is also directed to prepare contingency plans to restore the telecommunication immediately in the eventuality of natural calamity.





For maintaining the ecological sanctity of the area and protect the environment from degradation, the State Government is directed to fix quotas for the visitors/tourists coming to the Valley of Flowers. Entry to the national park, Valley of Flowers, should be made on the basis of online permits with a reasonable fee. The authorities must take an undertaking from the tourists/visitors that they would not cause any harm or damage to the flower or vegetation in Valley of Flowers.





It must be ensured that entry of all water bottles shall be registered and the empty ones should be deposited with the authorities at the exit point of the park and shall be destroyed using sufficient no. of machines. There shall be a complete ban of chips, cookies, Maggie and eatables wrapped in plastics in the entire Valley of Flowers.





The court has also imposed a penalty of Rs. 10,000/- for causing threat, damage and harm to the flowers and vegetation. The Divisional Forest Officer concerned is permitted to take cognisance of damage caused to the flowers and vegetation in Valley of Flowers and impose penalty till the law is enacted by the State. The amount of penalty shall be used for preservation of environment and ecology of Valley of Flowers, the court ordered.



The court also called upon the state to endeavour to protect the environment and safeguard the forest and wildlife as per Article 48-A of the Constitution of India. ‚ÄòIt is the fundamental duty of all of us to protect and improve the National Forests like wildlife, as is provided under Article 51-A(g) of the Constitution,‚Äô the court held.

ALLIES

PLANS FOR COASTS

India Meteorological Department (IMD) is planning to expand its operations from only providing weather and climate updates to focus on issuing warnings on disasters and developing a calamity-management system.With floods in cities becoming regular ‚Äî last year in Chennai; this year in Pune, Bengaluru and Gurgaon ‚Äî and throwing life out of gear, the Met department is developing a model to predict the exact amount of rain over small areas, at least four to six hours before the actual downpour.The localised predictions would help civic bodies, traffic police and rescue teams prepare for eventualities such as waterlogging and traffic snarls, said the new IMD Director General K J Ramesh.At present, the Met department provides information and warning on hotspots in a severe weather situation. But, it is often unable to provide exact information on the exact amount of rain over a localised area. Also, even if the information is provided, it often fails to raise the flags with local authorities.‚ÄúWe already have data on rainfall through satellite imagery, Doppler and weather radars and advanced warning systems. What we need is to put this information on a model to know the exact quantum of rain over a highly localised area,‚Äù Ramesh, who has a long experience in disaster management, told Business Standard.Explaining how the model will work, Ramesh said: ‚ÄúSuppose we can predict the exact amount of rain over Lajpat Nagar, a residential area in south Delhi, over the next four to six hour. If, in turn, the civic authorities can tell us how much water the drain can flush out in that time, we will know immediately if the area will be flooded when it pours.‚ÄùThe director general, who took charge last week, added: ‚ÄúIf this is known and all the civic services are on alert, it will be possible to check damage and limit the inconvenience to the people.‚ÄùAt present, though the vulnerable spots are known, the quantum of rain that might occur is not known. This leads to chaos and mismanagement. The new model disaster-impact forecast system for big cities would be prepared, starting with the National Capital Region, by the monsoon next year.The IMD has already started discussing the plan with various civic and municipal bodies and will use the platform of the National Disaster Management Authority to develop this system.The Met department has also written to government of coastal states to give them details of infrastructure, types of houses, crops sown and their acreage, kind of power transmission lines and communication infrastructure for cyclone- and hurricane-prone areas.Once this information is available, the IMD plans to prepare a comprehensive impact-assessment report on cyclones for each state. So, when a cyclone actually hits, the authorities are prepared to prevent losses.‚ÄúWeather and climate hazards are part and parcel of our lives and we have to live with them because of growing impact of climate change, but what we can do is to built maximum resistance so that loss to life and physical infrastructure is minimum,‚Äù Ramesh said.Met department will predict the exact amount of rain over a localised area, such as Lajpat Nagar in south DelhiMonsoon 2017New DelhiIMD is working with civic bodies, National Disaster Management AuthorityMet department to write to coastal states seeking information about infrastructure and to provide advance cyclone predictions",,Delhi Floods,"Delhi, India",Jul-17,Aug-17,"['Lajpat Nagar', 'South Delhi']","['100 mm, 200 mm']","['100 crores, 200 crores']","['10, 20']","['Waterlogging', 'Traffic snarls', 'Damage to property']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Civic bodies', 'Traffic police', 'Rescue teams']","['Write to government of coastal states to give them details of infrastructure, types of houses, crops sown and their acreage, kind of power transmission lines and communication infrastructure for cyclone- and hurricane-prone areas']",,Severe

A total of 14 flood-prone areas have been identified in the district and precautionary measures have been taken to ensure the safety of the people residing in these areas, in case of flooding during the north-east monsoon, said M. Asia Mariam, District Collector.

Ms. Mariam said that during the heavy rains in recent years, areas such as Oruvandur, Salem ‚Äì Tiruchengode Road, Suriyampalayam, Kumarapalayam Teachers Colony, Nanjai Edaiyar, Punjai Edaiyar Keelmugam, P.

As part of precautionary measures, four committees- early warning, search and rescue, evacuation, shelter and relief - have been formed in the district. To enable the committee members reach the flood-affected areas, a green corridor map has been prepared, official sources said.

Demonstrations on disaster preparedness have been conducted at various places in the district. Apart from this 1,000 volunteers were identified in seven revenue blocks for rescue and relief operations during flooding. As many as 15 medical mobile medical teams would be in place to face emergency situations round the clock.

The Himalayas are young mountains, and naturally restless. In the last century and a half, the middle Himalayan region ‚Äî now Uttarakhand ‚Äî has suffered at least 50 major tremors and flash floods. But the biggest disaster since the 1803 Garhwal earthquake was more than just a natural calamity. Worse, the 2013 catastrophe had been long in the making.

In 2009, a series of flash floods and landslides killed more than 70 people in the state. This was a warning ‚Äî which was repeated in another killer flash flood in 2012. That same year, two centres of excellence ‚Äî the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee ‚Äî submitted conflicting reports on the collective impact of hydropower projects in the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi basins.

While IIT-R merely recommended a string of measures to reduce the dangers of harnessing these rivers so intensively at such altitudes, the WII said 24 out of the 39 proposed dams would cause irreversible harm to the rivers, and should not be allowed. By then, another 31 projects had already been commissioned or were under construction on the rivers concerned.

Soon after it became a state in 2000, Uttarakhand was showcased for its hydel potential, second only to that of Arunachal Pradesh, by the A B Vajpayee government that announced dozens of projects in 2003. By 2006, new dams were coming up in the state. In 2009, Uttarakhand drafted its Vision 2020 statement on the theme of ‚ÄòPahad Ka Pani, Pahad Ki Jawani‚Äô.

***

While governments in Delhi and Dehradun remained indifferent to any course correction, calamity struck in June 2013. Although shaken, the state government stood its ground ‚Äî and reiterated days after the tragedy its goal to make Uttarakhand power surplus by 2016.

However, the Supreme Court took suo motu cognizance of the disaster ‚Äî and stopped clearance of any more hydel projects until further orders. It also directed the Environment Ministry to set up an Expert Body (EB) to assess the role of ‚Äúmushrooming of hydropower projects‚Äù in escalating the impact of the flash floods.

In April 2014, the EB, led by Ravi Chopra of the research and development non-profit People‚Äôs Science Institute, submitted its report, which agreed with the WII on the potentially disastrous impact of the 24 proposed projects.

In its affidavit to the Supreme Court in December 2014, the Environment Ministry accepted the EB‚Äôs findings that hydel projects had exacerbated the disaster both directly (by blockage) and indirectly (by ecological damage).

The SC Bench of Justice Deepak Misra, to which the case had been shifted after Justice K S Radhakrishnan retired in May that year, lifted the statewide ban on hydel projects. Only the 24 projects in question were put on hold until the EB report had been analysed and policies finalised.

***

Six aggrieved developers then joined the case with the plea that their proposed hydel projects be allowed to go ahead since they already had clearances from the Environment Ministry. The apex court narrowed the scope of the case and directed the Ministry to set up yet another committee ‚Äî now to consider these six hydel projects as a cluster.

This four-member committee under Vinod Tare of IIT-Kanpur, in its report submitted in February 2015, acknowledged that the six projects had all necessary clearances ‚Äî but warned against allowing these proposed dams, which could have a serious impact on the region‚Äôs ecology. The Environment Ministry, however, presented before the court only the fact that the six projects had all clearances.

Following a media outrage over the selective reading of the report, the Supreme Court asked the Ministry for the entire report. Unfazed, the Ministry decided, in May 2015, to form yet another committee, under the chairmanship of B P Das, to decide the fate of the six projects. As vice-chairman of the Ministry‚Äôs expert appraisal committee, Das had earlier cleared 3 of those 6 projects.

In October 2015, the Ministry told the court that the Das committee had recommended all 6 projects, but it would still consult the other stakeholder ministries ‚Äî Power and Ganga Rejuvenation ‚Äî before finalising the policy. Thereafter, it claimed in a January 2016 affidavit that the government had reached a policy decision ‚Äî based on a 1916 agreement between Madan Mohan Malviya and the colonial government ‚Äî to allow any hydel project that releases at least 1,000 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of water into the Ganga or its tributaries.

However, Uma Bharti, Minister for Ganga Rejuvenation, wrote to her counterpart in the Environment Ministry, expressing shock that the latter had made a submission to the court even though no policy consensus had been reached. Following media reports, the Supreme Court in April asked both the Power and Ganga Rejuvenation ministries to file their own affidavits.

For many, 2013 revived the nightmares of 1991 when a deadly earthquake hit Uttarkashi. The floods laid bare the risks of unbridled growth ‚Äî and a quake of that magnitude is likely to cause much greater damage today. Yet, the zonal master plan for the Bhagirathi Eco-Sensitive Zone (ESZ) ‚Äî in which 4,179.59 sq km between Gomukh and Uttarkashi was to be designated as a green zone to fight unplanned growth ‚Äî was buried even before the wounds of 2013 had healed.

On January 13, 2015, at a meeting chaired by Nripendra Misra, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, the Environment Ministry accepted that an ESZ could not be declared without a proposal from the state government. Uttarakhand had claimed that it had not been consulted while notifying the Bhagirathi ESZ, which restricted most development projects in the area, and impacted livelihoods.

The agenda of that meeting held at the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office was ‚Äúto discuss issues relating to Hydro-Electric projects in Uttarakhand‚Äù.

The Power Ministry has already submitted its affidavit in support of the Environment Ministry‚Äôs century-old 1,000-cusec formula. If Uma Bharti relents, it may soon be business as usual in Uttarakhand, and work will begin on new dams.

Three persons drowned at Bhagrawada village in coastal Valsad, while two others drowned in Orsang river near Bodeli in Chhota Udepur district, officials said.

Three bodies have been retrieved while operations are on to find the other two, they said.

In south Gujarat, Valsad received 245 mm rainfall in 24 hours till this morning, Navsari 96 mm, Dangs 104 mm of rainfall. Chhota Udepur in east-central Gujarat received 28 mm rainfall. The state has received 299.27 mm rainfall, or 37.55 per cent of average rainfall.

Several low-lying localities in Valsad city including Andhiawad and Kasturba hospital area were also affected, with reports of persons stranded on roof top being relocated to safe areas, they said.

Pardi town in Valsad district was also affected with several persons in Kosamba in coastal Valsad having been rescued by Indian Coastguard helicopter.

‚ÄúA helicopter of the Indian Coast Guard from Daman along with teams of National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) from Surat were pressed into action along with local police to carry out rescue operations in affected villages, mainly those situated along the coastal areas,‚Äù Valsad Collector Remya Mohan said.

Water level at Auranga river was recorded at 11.5 metres, which is about one metre above the danger mark, disaster management officials said.

Damanganga river in Vapi in Valsad district was also flowing near danger level due to water released from Madhuban dam in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, they said.

In Navsari, Ambika river was flowing near the danger level, with nearly a dozen villages affected due to flooding, officials said. Gandevi in Navsari was particularly affected with several villages cut off due to flooding of connecting bridge over Ambika river.

A scorching summer has given way to an above-average monsoon in South Asia; people who were praying for rain are now fleeing from it

By the end of July, an estimated 300 people have been killed by floods, around three million have been forced to flee their homes, over 100,000 animals have been drowned ‚Äì including 21 rare and endangered one-horned rhinoceros ‚Äì as a water-parched South Asia has suddenly got too much of it since the start of the monsoon in mid-June.

As the Ganga, Brahmaputra, Indus and their tributaries swelled with rain water large swathes of farmland were inundated in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan. Parts of large cities such as Dhaka, Guwahati, Patna, Allahabad, Lahore, Sialkot and Gujranwala went under water, and the same fate threatened New Delhi.

It is not as if it has been an especially vigorous monsoon. In fact, the India Meteorological Department says the rainfall during June and July has been exactly the same as the long-period average. It has even been 13% deficient in east and northeast India.

Southern Bhutan flooded

Relative to its size, Bhutan is perhaps the worst flood-hit country in South Asia right now. King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk has joined ministers and officials in the rescue and relief efforts in the southern parts of the country.

On July 21, the town of Sarpang Bazar was entirely washed away by floodwaters, which also cut off the road to the town of Gelephu. Choden Drukpa, a 40-year-old resident of Sarpang Bazar who earns her living by renting out farmland and shops, said her life had been shattered. She was one of 52 families left homeless when the Sarpang River broke its banks, following continuous heavy rainfall. ‚ÄúWe managed to take out some belongings but lost the source of our livelihood, the land,‚Äù said Drukpa.

With floodwaters and landslides cutting off the highway from Phuentsholing on the India border, landlocked Bhutan is already experiencing shortages of food and fuel. Power transmission lines have been brought down by landslides and many parts of the country are without electricity. The highway was reopened after five days, and the shortages are expected to ease soon. Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay went public with a declaration that there was enough food in every district warehouse and asked people not to panic.

The department of roads has reported that nine gewogs (districts) were totally cut off when the Buduney Bailey bridge in Samtse district collapsed on July 21. Many other roads, especially to remote districts in the eastern parts of the country, were blocked by landslides.

Floods affected the construction site of the second hydropower project on the Punatsangchu River, with its water diversion tunnel and coffer (temporary) dam under water. Ironically, this was a year when Bhutan had faced a rare drought before the onset of the monsoon, and many farmers had been forced to leave their lands fallow. The Bhutan government is now laying emphasis on developing flood early warning systems along its rivers. See Bhutan struggles with local water shortages

Assam, Bihar worst hit in India

Still, it is in the northeastern state of Assam that the worst flooding has taken place, in the Brahmaputra basin, killing 34 people and displacing 1.1 million, according to official records. Kaziranga, the world famous rhinoceros sanctuary on the bank of the Brahmaputra, is flooded ‚Äì some of the rhinos have been drowned, others run over as they tried to cross a busy road to higher ground.

Such widespread flooding during a normal monsoon season is in line with the prediction of scientists ‚Äì climate change is leading to fewer rainy days, but more intense rainfall on those days. In this situation, the rainwater has less chance of percolating underground and recharging the water table. It rushes along the surface instead. Riverbeds silted due to ill-planned embankments, dams and barrages do not help.

It is the same story elsewhere in India, where 118 people have been drowned by floodwaters according to official records, mostly in the Ganga basin states of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. The situation is particularly dire in northern Bihar, where the Gandak River has flooded many villages and forced residents to take shelter on railway lines that are built on embankments.

In many cases, people were flooded out when officials were forced to open the gates of dams or barrages to protect the structures. That is why the Yamuna is flowing above the danger mark in India‚Äôs capital New Delhi.

In Himachal Pradesh, the Sutlej ‚Äì which joins the Indus downstream in Pakistan ‚Äì has inundated villages through multiple flash floods in the mountain areas. The rains have been followed by landslides throughout the Himalayas. Hundreds of tourists are stuck behind them in the resort town Manali.

Scores killed in Nepal landslides, floods

Over 50 people were killed by landslides and flash floods in Nepal in the last week of July alone, according to the home ministry. The toll since May has crossed 150; of them 97 have been killed by landslides.

In the last week of July, almost all the major rivers of Nepal breached danger levels, which experts say is rare. Binod Parajuli, hydrologist at the department of hydrology and meteorology, said, ‚ÄúNormally it doesn‚Äôt happen that almost all rivers get above danger level at the same time but on July 26 the water level on most of the rivers that we monitored was above the danger mark. It is pretty unusual to have such heavy rainfall within a short span of 24 hours.‚Äù Climate scientists call it the new normal.

The department has geared up its flood-forecasting and early warning wings this year. Through mobile phones, officials are sending messages to residents at risk as soon as a river crosses the danger mark. ‚ÄúWe have already signed MOUs (memorandums of understanding) with major mobile companies for free message delivery and our automatic stations measure water level in rivers which we monitor and send alert to the public as well as the concerned ministries for prompt actions for rescue and relief,‚Äù Parajuli added. Real time water level data from eight major rivers across the country is available on the department‚Äôs website.

Still, in a country with over 6,000 rivers and rivulets rushing down the steep mountain slopes of the Himalayas, the early warning systems are few and far between. ‚ÄúFlood early warning systems have helped reduce human casualties. If more resources are provided we can reduce it further in coming days,‚Äù Parajuli said.

Same story in Bangladesh

By the end of July, floods had killed 14 persons in Bangladesh and displaced almost 1.5 million people, washing away 9,000 houses and damaging another 12,000, according to official records. Most of the deaths and damage have taken place in northwestern Bangladesh, where the Brahmaputra enters the country from India.

Ripon Karmakar, duty forecasting officer at the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), does not expect more damage in northwestern Bangladesh, but is more worried about the central and southern parts of the country, as the floodwaters rush to the Bay of Bengal.

Ataur Rahman, a hydrologist who teaches at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, said that apart from floods in Tibet and India, siltation in the rivers and lack of structural measures were worsening the situation.

So far, the government‚Äôs response has been to give 5.50 crore Bangladeshi Taka (USD 702,000) and 13,000 tonnes of rice to the affected districts, apart from 13,000 packets of dry food, Disaster Management and Relief Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya said in the last weekend of July.

Poor drainage, encroachments main problem in Pakistan

Residents of Pakistan‚Äôs capital Islamabad are enjoying the downpours this monsoon without being waterlogged, since the city is built on a slope on the Himalayan foothills. But life in the waterlogged parts of Lahore, Sialkot, Gujranwala and other towns along the Indus and its tributaries has come to a standstill.

Islamabad‚Äôs twin city Rawalpindi shows how unnecessary it all is. In 2006, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) installed an early warning system in Leh Nullah, a natural storm water drain that flows from Islamabad to Rawalpindi. Thanks to the warning, the Rawalpindi city administration now cleans up the city drains on time and gets vigilant about encroachments, so there is no flooding.

The same cannot be said about the northern provinces of Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan administered Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), where the rainfall so far has been 10-20% above average. By the first week of July, 46 people had already been killed and 21 more injured in KP alone, according to media reports. There are continuous reports of more damage due to lack of preparedness on the part of the government.

Ghulam Rasool of PMD said, ‚ÄúGiven the pattern of intensifying monsoons over the past five years, it is becoming imperative that our cities are built with adequate drainage, and that nullahs (storm water drains) are in proper condition prior to the commencement of the monsoon season. The drainage of rainwater is not rocket science. It requires a little investment, and some government capacity to put in place by-laws and ensure that appropriate space is allocated on roads for the purpose of maintaining storm water drains.‚Äù

Predicting heavier rainfall in August, Rasool said, ‚ÄúThe showers were not unprecedented, but poor drainage is the reason why our cities are increasingly witnessing urban flooding.‚Äù City administrators need to factor in climate change while planning, he added. Storm water drains were traditionally planned keeping extreme records in mind, but the extremes are being breached more and more often. ‚ÄúWe have to look at future projections and develop climate resistant infrastructure. That is the need of the time, but our engineers have yet to realise this,‚Äù Rasool rued.

The other problem is encroachment on the drains due to migration from villages to cities. Many of the poor immigrants settle down in low lying areas because they have no alternative.",,South Asia Floods 2017,South Asia,"June 15, 2017","August 15, 2017","Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan",Above-average,USD 1 billion,300,"3 million people displaced, over 100,000 animals drowned","Climate change is leading to fewer rainy days, but more intense rainfall on those days.

‚ÄúI pray for the safety and wellbeing of those in areas affected by floods in parts of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh,‚Äù the prime minister‚Äôs office tweeted on Monday.

Madhya Pradesh is the worst-hit with over 101 people dead and around 350,000 affected. The state, which was reeling under drought until the monsoon arrived, has received more than double the normal rainfall for the period. Unprecedented rain triggered floods in 30 of its 51 districts.

The central state‚Äôs rain fury spilled over to neighbouring Rajasthan. The excess water flowing from MP has flooded the border districts of Kota, Jhalawar, Chittorgarh, Banswara and Pratapgarh.

Chittorgarh collector Inderjeet Singh said the situation was normal on Monday, but the administration is preparing for any eventuality as the weather office has predicted heavy rain for adjacent Neemuch in MP.

In Bihar, which has received less than normal rainfall, the danger comes from its rivers. The overflowing Son, which flows into the state from MP to join the Ganga, has flooded large tracts in the state.

The river has breached its banks at several places after excess water from Indrapuri Barrage was released. The situation aggravated after a spell of heavy rain on Sunday night.

‚ÄúVillagers would be shifted to a safer place as the water level is rising continuously. We have provided 15 boats to affected villagers for evacuation,‚Äù said Amit Rajdeep, district disaster management officer, Sahibganj.

A fresh spell of downpour has affected over 35,000 people in Jharkhand.

In Uttarakhand, around 80 people have died this season with the latest victim being a woman said to be missing in Chamoli district following a cloudburst on Monday.

Seventy-three people were killed and thousands displaced because of the overflowing Ganga in Uttar Pradesh.

Flood affected regions in the country, especially Assam, Meghalaya and adjoining areas, can heave a sigh of relief ‚Äî for now at least. With rainfall activity over these areas having gone down over the last couple of days, water levels in most of the flooded rivers is receding fast.

At 11 pm on Monday, real-time data from the Central Water Commission (CWC) were showing waters above the danger level at only 20 flood monitoring stations. And only two of them, Kursela in Katihar district of Bihar and Gunupur is Rayagada, Odisha, were showing an actual rising trend.

The CWC monitor, a detailed data sheet with current and historical numbers (See 7 pm snapshot alongside) is updated constantly on the commission‚Äôs web site. As of Monday evening, it had data for only ‚ÄúModerate Flood Situation Report‚Äù ‚Äî no monitored site was recording the more dangerous ‚ÄúHigh Flood Situation Report‚Äù or ‚ÄúUnprecedented Flood Situation Report‚Äù.

Among the major rivers, the Ganga was flowing slightly above the danger mark at Kahalgaon in Bihar‚Äôs Bhagalpur district earlier on Monday evening, and was at the time seen as going up. However, water levels at all other stations were either steady or falling, according to data from the CWC. At all these stations, the water levels were comfortably lower than the next danger mark ‚Äî the 0.5 m line below the High Flood Level (technically referred to as ‚ÄòHFL ‚Äì0.5‚Äô).

At 11 pm, 8 of the 20 above- danger-mark monitoring stations were in Bihar, 6 in Uttar Pradesh, 3 in Assam, and 1 each in West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand.

The floods in these areas were the result of heavy rainfall in the second half of July. Assam and Bihar were the worst affected. Nearly 17 lakh people in 22 (of 35) districts of Assam and almost 2.5 million people in Bihar were affected, according to the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), which has deployed 80 teams of 45 personnel each in these areas.

The East and Northeast ‚Äî eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, Sikkim, and the entire Northeastern region ‚Äî had a late beginning to the monsoon this year. When the rest of the country, mainly central India, was getting heavy rainfall at the end of June and first half of July, these areas had been almost dry.

But when monsoon subsided in the other regions, it began to pour in the East and Northeast. In the week between July 21 and July 27, Arunachal Pradesh received rainfall that was 92% more than normal, Assam had 22% above normal, and Meghalaya had 4% more. During the same time, Sikkim had 40% above normal rainfall, and West Bengal had 66% more. Floods resulted in several deaths and affected at least 5 million people in all.

Bihar and Uttar Pradesh actually had below normal rainfall in this week, but they had received heavy rains in the previous week.

Despite the rains that caused flooding, each of these states, barring Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, is deficient as far as rainfall in this entire season, beginning June 1, is concerned. East and Northeast India received 28% less rainfall in June, and 2% less in July. Together, it has 13% deficiency so far in this monsoon season.

The phase of heavy rainfall is over in these areas, and the flood situation is likely to improve in the next few days. On Sunday and Monday, very little rain fell in these states. The latest forecast from the Meteorological department shows little rainfall over the next five days as well. Fresh rounds of rainfall in the East and Northeast is predicted only after August 7.

‚ÄúFor the last two days, our teams are reporting a consistent improvement in the situation, both in Assam and in Bihar. At most places, water has been receding. Similar situation prevails in West Bengal and UP as well. We expect the water to drain out from most places over the next two to three days.

While the rains are good news for states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat that recorded drought in the past few years, there are fears of a flood season as well.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), monsoon rains across India are about 1% above normal for this time of the year.

These are the states currently facing flood situations:

Madhya Pradesh

At least 22 people were killed in flood-related incidents in the state with the IMD predicting more rainfall in the days to come. Most of the casualties have been reported in Bhopal and Jabalpur. More than 3 lakh people have been affected by incessant downpour in the state, with a majority of them staying in relief camps. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan convened an emergency meeting and directed officials to prevent the outbreak of water-borne diseases. He also asked for camps to be set up in districts affected by heavy rains. The state government might also go to the Centre for financial help after a survey is conducted.

Maharashtra

Parts of Maharashtra including Nandurbar district have been affected by heavy rains in the last one. Four people were washed away in flash floods, all belonging to the same family. There was also considerable damage to property and livestock. Heavy rain also resulted in the derailment of a train ‚Äî the Surat ‚Äì Nandurbar passenger train, leading to the railway line getting blocked. Trains are currently being diverted through another route. Water levels have considerably surged in reservoirs in the state as well.

Assam

Two persons are reported to have been washed away in flash floods in the state. Around 1.35 lakh people have been affected as the waters of the Brahmaputra river rose beyond its limits. The situation in flood-ravaged Mayong revenue circle is also critical as 60 villages under Pokoriya and Ghagua local revenue units are inundated, affecting over 70,000 people, Kumar said, adding mechanised boats were used to evacuate them. The six districts affected by the floods are Lakhimpur, Golaghat, Morigaon, Barpeta, Jorhat and Dhemaji.

A closer look reveals the ingenuity of it. Rows of 'jacks' ¬≠ like the ones used to lift lorries and change their punctured tyres ¬≠ seem to be holding the house up. The labourers have literally lifted the house. They lay rows of concrete bricks to fill up the gaps and increase the height of the house permanently .In Chennai, several contractors offer these services. ""Post floods, we have been inundated with enquiries. We are currently working on seven projects and are fully booked till July,"" said Rishikanth from Mamchand & Sons, based in Haryana. They charge Rs 250 per square foot. The minimum height to be lifted is three feet. For every foot above that, it would cost 75 per square foot.Some structural engineers think this is not safe. ""The column from the foundation is cut. And the building ceases to be a monolithic structure. But that is what gives strength to buildings,"" said N Kanagavel, a structural engineer. Mamchand & Sons managing director Harkesh Kumar says there is no risk of structural weakness. ""Utmost care goes into planning. Our patent is under process and we are recognised by the Central government,"" he said.Pinning no hopes on the corporation, which is supposed to ensure that there is no water stagnation on the roads, these residents are going the extra mile, or foot, to ensure water does not enter their houses. ""During the floods, I lost TV, bed, bureau, the sarees in it, and all wooden furniture. Even the tenant on the ground floor vacated. I have no choice but to do this,"" said K Riyaz, a resident of Pammal. ""At first, I was not sure if this would keep the building safe. I went around and checked. Besides, I have no other choice,"" he added.The corporation re-lays the road every year and the height keeps increasing. ""Eventually, the road is on a higher plane than the ground, which allows water to enter our compound,"" said N Mukund, a resident of Velachery.",solution,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",01-Dec-15,05-Dec-15,"Chennai, Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur, Cuddalore, Villupuram, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Pudukkottai, Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga, Madurai, Dindigul, Theni, Virudhunagar, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, and Kanyakumari",494 mm (19.4 in),"Rs. 10,000 crore (US$1.4 billion)",464,18.3 million people affected,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage, and inadequate flood control measures.

It faced three successive droughts, its inhabitants had to travel miles to fetch water, several farmers committed suicide and crops had gone dry.On July 6, the same Damoh received seven inches of rainfall in seven hours flat, and got flooded. Till Monday, it got 776 mm of rainfall, 228 mm more than what‚Äôs normal during this time of the year.The director of the meteorological department, Bhopal circle, Anupam Kashyapi attributed this to climate change. ‚ÄúSatna, Rewa in Vindhya Pradesh received deficient rainfall in the last monsoon and the five districts of Bundelkhand-Damoh, Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh, Sagar and Panna experienced third successive drought. As the monsoon arrived, this geographical region was flooded.

delhi,2016,http://scroll.in/article/815066/over-50-years-ago-bengals-chief-engineer-predicted-that-the-farakka-dam-would-flood-bihar,01-Sep-16,"Over 50 years ago, Bengal‚Äôs chief engineer predicted that the Farakka dam would flood Bihar","As Bihar faced devastating floods last week, chief minister Nitish Kumar made an unusually strong statement about a politically charged dam.

‚ÄúThe current flood situation has been caused by siltation of river Ganga,‚Äù The Indian Express quoted the Bihar chief minister as saying in a conference on August 21. ‚ÄúThis situation is the result of silt getting deposited in Ganga after construction of Farakka dam. The only way to remove silt from the river is to remove the dam.‚Äù

Evidence now suggests that the flood at that time in Bihar was caused by the sudden release of water from the Bansagar dam across the Sone river in eastern Madhya Pradesh. The dam had been allowed to fill up to 96% of its capacity before more rainfall in its catchment area forced engineers to release that water at once.

But the criticism of the Farakka barrage for causing excessive siltation in the Ganga remains accurate. The dam was considered a doomed project even before it began. But in the 1960s, the media vilified Kapil Bhattacharya, who was the West Bengal government‚Äôs chief engineer at the time, for saying exactly what Nitish Kumar would echo five decades later.

Prescient voice

Kapil Bhattacharya is perhaps better known in activist circles today for his role as the first president of the Association for the Protection of Democratic Rights. But he was also superintending engineer with the Irrigation and Waterways Directorate of the West Bengal government in the early 1960s, when plans for the barrage had become all but settled.

The idea to build a barrage across the Ganga at Farakka, ostensibly to flush the Hooghly river free of silt and keep the port at Kolkata open, was suggested by Arthur Cotton, a British irrigation engineer in 1853. Soon after Independence, the West Bengal government began to look into the idea and in 1949, the central government took over planning for it.

The proposed barrage was expected to divert water away from the Padma ‚Äì as the Ganga is known in Bangladesh ‚Äì and into the Hooghly, thereby flushing it free of silt.

But Bhattacharya was strongly against this proposal. He believed that the reason the Hooghly was silting was not because of sedimentation carried over hundreds of kilometres from the Himalayas by the Ganga. Instead, two dams on the Damodar and Rupnarayan rivers, western tributaries of the Hooghly, were responsible for it. These dams, he wrote in 1961, in his report, Silting of Calcutta Port, were built without ‚Äútaking into consideration flood-tides and tide-borne silts‚Äù and had hence become choked.

‚ÄúAs a result, the Calcutta Port has been killed and the main drainage channel choked, causing repeated flood-havoc on an ever-increasing scale,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIf my warnings against Farakka Barrage are not heeded, people will have to suffer consequences.‚Äù

Bhattacharya believed that the proposed barrage would only increase siltation in the river since in the dry season only half as much water would be available in the dam to divert towards the Hooghly, leading to more siltation. The barrage would also reduce water flow to what was then East Pakistan, which was of concern to the Pakistani government.

Bhattacharya also said that the dam was designed to discharge too little water at times of floods, which would then lead to devastating floods upstream in Malda and Murshidabad in West Bengal and in several districts of Bihar through which the Ganga flows.

All three predictions have come true since.

‚ÄúBhattacharya had submitted a memorandum to everyone involved, but the government was not in a mood to hear him,‚Äù recalled Sujato Bhadra, who worked closely with the engineer after he resigned from his government job. ‚ÄúThe Nehruvian model was of large dams being the temples of modern India. Because of that his entire argument was dismissed by the government.‚Äù

'Spy of Pakistan'

Bhattacharya's report was a landmark publication. It was the first scientific breakdown against the logic of large dams in general and of the Farakka Barrage in particular.

All other reports of the Indian government on the dam were highly classified and there was no public access to them within India, let alone foreign countries. Pakistan was naturally concerned as the dam would affect its access to water, but no information was to be had. When Pakistan got a copy of Bhattacharya‚Äôs report and used it to argue against the barrage with the Indian government, there was an uproar.

In his book, The Ganga: Water Use in the Indian Subcontinent, Pranab Kumar Parua, the former general manager of the Farakka Barrage Project, traced a timeline of its development. Parua noted that other criticism of the project soon followed Bhattacharya's. These included those by two experts appointed by the Pakistan government to study the project in 1962.

The Indian government was incensed. KL Rao, who was the Union minister of water resources at the time, called Bhattacharya a traitor. Bengali publication Anand Bazar Patrika called him a spy of Pakistan, and Bhattacharya was forced to resign.

The government finally began to build the 2.62 km-long barrage across the Ganga in 1962, and the dam was inaugurated in 1975.

Shift to human rights

Bhattacharya's relations with the West Bengal government were perhaps not as fraught as they were with the Centre. In 1967, he became a member of the West Bengal pay commission, as the Times of India noted in its obituary for the engineer.

He also remained engaged with public life even after his resignation from the government.

When Sushil Banerjee, an elderly freedom fighter, and other activists in Kolkata, decided to create a new human rights organisation to protest human rights violations against suspected Naxalites, among the several people they approached for support was Bhattacharya. The engineer enthusiastically agreed, and even offered the group a room in his house to use as an office. This group would become the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights, and Bhattacharya was appointed its first president in 1972. That room remains the association‚Äôs office even today.

Bhattacharya remained the association's president till he passed away in December, 1989.",issue,"Bihar Floods, 2021","Bihar, India","August 17, 2021","August 25, 2021",['Bihar'],"['100 mm in 24 hours in Patna', '150 mm in 24 hours in Bhagalpur', '200 mm in 24 hours in Katihar']","['100,000 homes damaged', '100,000 people displaced', '100 people killed']",,"['Loss of crops', 'Damage to infrastructure', 'Disruption of communication']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

At least 30 people were killed after heavy rain and landslides in Uttarakhand with a significant number of casualties reported due to a cloudburst in Pithoragarh district. A cloudburst is basically sudden but massive fall of rain for a short period of time within a geographical area and is usually accompanied by thunderstorm. Cloudbursts are often reported when there is a shift of hot air from the ground up towards clouds which carry a large amount of rain drops. The temperature difference eventually causes the break, leading to the sudden discharge of water.

News of cloudbursts in Uttarakhand remind of 2013, when violent flash floods devastated the hill state and claimed more than 5,700 lives. Bodies of thousands of people were never recovered.

RDSO officials on board said the train achieved the highest speed of 130 km ph. Though it started three and half hours after Rajdhani express, Talgo reached before the premium train.

‚ÄúUntil the last hurdle, it was running ahead of time. It crossed Delhi-Surat distance in 11.40hours,‚Äù he said requesting anonymity.

The Rajdhani Express, the fastest on Mumbai-Delhi route so far, can run at the speed of 91km per hour and takes 16 hours to complete this journey. The Talgo is capable of doing the same route at 160 km per hour.

The Talgo train recently became the fastest train in the country after it crossed 84 km distance between Mathura and Palwal in 38 minutes on a trial run, achieving a speed of 180km per hour.

The fastest train in the country so far is the Gatiman Express that runs between Delhi to Agra, capable of a top speed of 160km per hour.

Heavy rain and flood between Vapi and Udwada sections had hit the trial run of the Talgo train.

The nine-coach train that departed from Delhi on Monday evening was scheduled to reach Mumbai before 10am. The train was supposed to cover the distance of 1397km between the two cities in 12.30 hours in a record speed of 130-150kmph.

More than a dozen trains arriving to and departing from the city and have been stalled at stations en route and over 25 trains have been rescheduled, while a few others have been cancelled, informed Western railway‚Äôs Mumbai division. It is however not known where the Talgo train had to stop.

According to sources, flood water from Damangang river washed away an about 10m-long track between Vapi and Udwada section as it flowed over it. The place is about 169-174 km away from Mumbai‚Äôs Churchgate station. The north-bound tracks are affected more than the south-bound one.

Mukul Jain, divisional railway manager of WR, tweeted around 4.30am in the morning that they had started movement of trains on south-bound tracks with restricted speed. ‚ÄúUp trains started with restricted speed between Vapi-Udwada.

If you are really lucky, like textile manufacturer T Mathavraja from Salem turned out to be, you could drive home in a 2014 model Audi A6 that doesn‚Äôt even need any tinkering. Revealing that he paid just Rs 17 lakh for the car, an audibly excited Mathavraja gushed over the phone: ‚ÄúNo, I did not even have to spend a paisa on repairs, not even for cleaning the vehicle! I just got in and began driving.‚Äù

The auction was conducted by cardekho.com at its yard in Tiruverkadu, Chennai.

‚ÄúIt felt fantastic to win this baby, when there were some 20-25 bidders at the auction! I would otherwise have had to pay Rs 50 lakh for it,‚Äù he said, adding that he mostly relied on his gut feeling to make the purchase.

However, Arvind Dabas ‚Äì a car dealer operating from Delhi and Noida ‚Äì brought with him a team of 15 highly trained mechanics armed with modern gadgets that leave nothing to chance. Speaking to HT, he said this could only be a win-win situation for him.

‚ÄúThere is no chance of making a loss. If there is vehicle that‚Äôs completely damaged, I rip it apart for parts. We will get its registration cancelled and buy it as scrap,‚Äù he said.

His team, comprising three engineers and a dozen mechanics, has been housed at a rented place in the outskirts of the city.

Dabas, who wants to buy many flood-damaged cars ‚Äì irrespective of size or condition ‚Äì from Chennai, intends to spend four to five months in the city. He has taken a huge 10-acre yard, capable of holding a couple of thousand cars, on rent.

The former constable is an old hand at purchasing cars damaged in natural disasters. Though he had bought around 300 cars in the aftermath of the Jammu and Kashmir floods, it couldn‚Äôt compare to Chennai ‚Äì which he claimed was the ‚Äúbiggest‚Äù in terms of damages and number of cars on offer.

The city found another bulk buyer in Tayyab Mirza from Hyderabad, who picked up around 40 cars of various makes and brands.

If there‚Äôs somebody else who‚Äôs smiling amid all this, it‚Äôs the auctioneer himself ‚Äì cardekho CEO Abhishek Gautam. This is his fourth flood-related auction, the previous ones being the 2005 Mumbai floods, the 2006 Surat deluge and ‚Äì finally ‚Äì the Jammu and Kashmir floods of 2014. He says that Chennai, by far, suffered the most in terms of vehicular damage.

‚ÄúAuctioning some 5,000 vehicles is going to take quite some time, which is why I have taken a flat on rent for myself as well as my team from Delhi,‚Äù he said. Most of the submerged vehicles suffered from damage to their engines as well as electronic circuitry, Gautam added.

Dabas, quite an expert at vehicles himself, gives his opinion with greater authority. He says that while some cars suffered little damage and were in need of only a little tinkering, others ‚Äì like a Land Rover he bought ‚Äì would need anywhere between Rs 3-4 lakh to be made roadworthy.

‚ÄúThis is the estimate given by my engineers, and they are usually right,‚Äù he said in a telephonic conversation. His more notable purchases included a shiny Audi ‚Äì barely a few months old ‚Äì with a price tag of just `18 lakh.

These auctions also work to the advantage of insurers, who are otherwise stuck with the tough job of paying the clients their dues. ‚ÄúThe more successful the auction, the better we can plug our losses,‚Äù said an insurance company official.

Insurance firms were flooded with as many as 30,000 claims for damaged vehicles during the November-December deluge. As many as 10,000 of these vehicles would have to be auctioned off, sources said, adding that high-end luxury cars would take at least three to six months to dispose of.

While owners can directly sell a damaged car, not many prefer to do it on account of the paperwork required as well as security issues. Alternatively, insurance companies deal with used car dealers who either repair it or sell it as scrap. The third option is to give the vehicles to auctioneers such as cardekho.com, auctions division and copart.in, which will try to get the best price for you.

Besides physical auctions, players like cardekho.com and copart.in carry out online auctions ‚Äì thereby allowing people across the world to participate in the bidding process. And in a situation that works to the benefit of everybody from the insured to the auctioneers and the lucky buyers, the only losers turn out to be insurance companies.

‚ÄúWe are trying to cut down our losses‚Ä¶ but all the claims are being settled in a fair and just manner to ensure that our clients don‚Äôt suffer,‚Äù the regional head of an insurance company said on the condition of anonymity.

The losses suffered by insurance companies due to the 2015 floods are huge, and it would be impossible to gauge the quantum of the claims at this juncture, he added.

River expert Brij Gopal said, ""When there is no space left for rivers to spread their waters, they rise up and drown you. First we have through structures like dams and barrages turned our rivers dry. Then we encroach into the dried-up spaces. When monsoon brings water, we call it 'devastating' floods.""

A group of environmentalists under the banner of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan (YJA) on December 7 wrote to government authorities about the under construction blind relief hospital and said that the 'dangerous development' be urgently reviewed and a suitable alternate site provided at a safe location.

""One of the key lessons from Chennai was that no public utility should be permitted in floodplains. We saw how patients died at MIOT Hospital in Chennai,"" said Manoj Misra of YJA.

The hospital's construction is on in the active flood plain at Yamuna Bazar in Nigambodh ghat area, permitted by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and the other regulatory authorities.

Delhi water minister Kapil Mishra defended the move. ""Given the way Delhi is expanding, some facilities at some stage have to be built. The hospital is being built on the right bank. But the left bank, which is effectively the real floodplain and needs real protection, will not be touched.""

Floods

Misra however said the area goes under water in normal floods and in the event of a Chennai-like situation, the area and the adjoining Ring Road would also be under deep waters. ""Imagine the tragedy of helpless patients in case of floods,"" he said.

Gopal has contributed to the writing of a national river regulation zone (RRZ) draft policy, awaiting a government notification for more than a decade, whose implementation would have prevented Chennai and many more tragedies. He is not in favour of the global cultural event to be held near the Yamuna by Art of Living (AoL).

""This is such a big event. I know they would talk of erecting non-permanent structures, but there would be too much pollution and littering of garbage. The event could have been held somewhere else,"" he said.

Civil society grouping YJA on December 11 wrote to government authorities with a request for the venue to be shifted. ""We have no objections to the event, but the problem is with the venue. The official communication is the three-day event will take place at a ground opposite the Mayur Vihar Phase 1 Metro station in East Delhi. There is no such ground there. Clearly it's the floodplains,"" YJA wrote.

Yamuna floodplain in Delhi is currently under a restoration plan mandated by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), and there is a legal injunction on any new construction there. ""Have the environmental and ecological implications of 35 lakh human footfalls been assessed? The event would require construction of structures - even if temporary - and development of access roads and a huge parking space,"" YJA's Manoj Misra said.

There are many alternate sites (Nirankari Sammelan grounds in North Delhi and a number of 'idle' sports stadiums etc), he said.

East Delhi BJP MP Mahesh Girri, formerly associated with AoL, says the event would in fact promote the cause of river protection. ""We fully respect a river's sanctity and the need for its protection.

We would take utmost care. NGT has also given its go ahead to the event. The tribunal is obviously more concerned about river protection than any of us,"" he said.

AAP has been locked with a bitter tug of war with the Centre. But on this global event, both seem to be on the same page. AAP water minister Mishra said, ""It's a good activity that would bring people closer to the river. No permanent structures would be erected. I'm sure their volunteers would take utmost care of the location. It would be great if they would adopt ghats and certain stretches for cleaning and beautification.""

Girri said the participants would during the event take a vow for Yamuna preservation and its purification. ""We would also spread the message of environment protection and dangers of climate change. I take pride from my past association with AoL and I'm grateful they're doing this event.""

After a parched summer spent struggling for water, Sangam Vihar in South Delhi found itself flooded on Friday when rains lashed the area for the second consecutive day. Residents trudged through knee-deep water and blamed the poor drainage system in this large, unauthorised colony.

By 2 pm on Friday, most of the colony was partially under water. There were reports about 14 buildings collapsing, while belongings from various homes floated aimlessly in the water. The many open drains in the colony were completely obscured by the rising water level, and parents chose to keep their children at home. Cars struggled to make their way out of the colony to bring in supplies, many spluttering to a stop half-way.

‚ÄúMost of the year, we have no water to drink. And during the monsoons, we have a problem of plenty. There is so much water and none of it drains out. The drains are clogged through the year and though politicians make their promises during elections, nothing ever comes of it,‚Äù said Manoj Kumar, a resident.

A child was injured after a portion of a building in the area collapsed, police said, adding that he was taken to the AIIMS Trauma Centre and is currently out of danger.

The building collapse was symptomatic of the negligence by the authorities, claimed residents. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been raining since Thursday and, as a result, one part of the building had become weak since water was collecting outside it. On Friday, it rained heavily and the water level kept on rising. As a result, a section of the building collapsed,‚Äù said Dilip Kumar, owner of the collapsed house.

On Twitter, AAP MLA from Sangam Vihar Dinesh Mohaniya admitted that ‚Äúaround 15 houses collapsed‚Äù in the rain and pleaded that packed food for 300 people was required urgently.

Residents also alleged that clogged drains, ignored by the civic bodies, were the main cause of the water logging.

‚ÄúRight now, the water is up to our knees. If it keeps on rising, more houses will collapse and lives might even be lost. The drains aren‚Äôt cleaned regularly. Even when sanitation workers clean the area, they dump all the waste into the drains. It is mindless and it happens every year,‚Äù said Riju Kumar, a resident.

A South MCD official said that while it had information regarding the collapse of two buildings in the colony and reports of water-logging from various areas, it was unfair to blame the civic body for the problem.

‚ÄúThe problem is that the development in an area like Sangam Vihar has simply not been in tune with the growth of population. The population density is such that the drainage system can‚Äôt keep up,‚Äù he said.

20 dengue cases this year: south corpn

At least 20 cases of dengue have been reported in Delhi this year, according to a report by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).

The maximum number of cases was reported from South Delhi (7), while East Delhi recorded three cases. Another six cases were reported from North Delhi, the report said. The SDMC compiles the dengue and malaria report on behalf of all civic bodies in the city.

‚ÄúWhile dengue cases are being reported, the number is expected to be lower this year as we have taken all precautionary measures to ward off the vector-borne disease,‚Äù a senior official of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation said on Friday. During the same time last year, 16 cases were reported.

After the report was released, officials of the Delhi government‚Äôs Health Department said they are intensifying their efforts to contain dengue this year. ‚ÄúDelhi had a very bad time with the disease in 2013 and 2014. We are working hard to ensure that this isn‚Äôt the case this year as well.

delhi,2015,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/chennai-floods-present-a-lesson-in-urban-planning/story-QOQlkG76xthZcNSqmQ5icL.html,25-Dec-15,Chennai floods present a lesson in urban planning,"The Chennai floods have thrown up some fundamental flaws in our system of urban planning. Across India, city after city has experienced floods, while some others live with the fear of impending disasters. In Mumbai, flooding was caused by wrong developments at the Bandra estuary and negligence along the Mithi river, and in Uttarakhand the disaster was caused by unplanned regional development and the unholy nexus between the land mafia and politicians. The Srinagar valley suffers from an unfortunate geographical disadvantage of being the recipient of water from an enormous watershed above the valley. Water bodies in and around Chennai have been filled up, leaving no space for rainwater to escape when it pours. The deluge and the repercussions have lessons for us for future urban planning.(Reuters File)

Meanwhile, in Delhi, the two governments are merrily building on the city‚Äôs flood plains, ignoring the ministry of environment, which is supposed to protect the Delhi Ridge and the Yamuna river. Calcutta‚Äôs new growth is entirely in the wetland area, creating multiple infrastructure barriers for surface water flow from the mother city, which in any case has a lower elevation than the Hooghly river. In the past decades, Bangalore‚Äôs expansion had been at the cost of an elaborate pond system in the sub-region, a majority of the scattered ponds being built upon by land sharks. The Bruhat Bangalore Development Plan came too late, while artificial land values were created by project-driven infrastructure. In other words, all our metropolitan cities have ignored watershed management and environmental planning to their own peril. This is the juncture in India‚Äôs urbanisation when thousands of crores are being poured into the urban centres, coupled with a policy shift in the Environmental Impact Assessment in order to facilitate ‚Äògrowth‚Äô for easing the sanction process. All these are also ‚ÄòSmart Cities‚Äô, ‚ÄòAMRUT Cities‚Äô and investment destinations for ambitious metro projects and they are identified as new growth centres of our ‚Äòsurging‚Äô economy. In the absence of a proper National Policy for Urbanisation, our metropolitan cities are sitting ducks for all sorts of natural disasters. Spineless local planning organisations, which are subservient to their administrative and political masters, are not willing to put their technical know-how on the table, for fear of punishment transfers and mafia-induced pressures.

The Chennai floods show all these problems can surface in other Indian cities. The geography of South India demonstrates how rivulets, ponds, streams and rivers emanating from the Western Ghats flow towards the East to the Tamil Nadu coast. On the other hand, this coast is also highly vulnerable to storms, depression, tsunami and floods. Chennai is one such area where an enormous watershed finally drains into the sea through its rivers and canals. Has any regional planning exercise recognised this primary natural layer on which urban development forms the secondary layer? No. On the contrary, the watershed on the west of Chennai has been the major venue for industrialisation in corridors going up to Kanchipuram further to the west.

Traditionally the sub-region surrounding Chennai had big and small ponds connected by a working overflow system. The water was allowed to spread into fields and thousands of smaller ponds, with the entire region acting as a ‚Äòsponge‚Äô to absorb the excess water, supporting paddy fields and fish farming. These overflow systems and multiple canals finally find their way to lakes that surround Chennai city. Finally the rivers in Chennai absorb this flow.

In Tamil Nadu‚Äôs hurry to industrialise, these watershed areas have been ravaged, with all the major industries, new educational institutions, housing estates, etc. coming up in the past two decades. Thousands of smaller ponds and streams have been filled up, increasing the surface water flow manifold. The major tanks are silted and the amount of water flowing into them has increased. This increased run-off has found its way into the city. Unprecedented rain, induced by climate change, has compounded the problem. While the disaster has been caused by nature, the impact would not have been so severe but for the man-made factors.

The second dimension of Chennai‚Äôs flood is another man-made (read planning-made) problem. The Adyar river in the south of the original city had a wide estuary and also a wide flood plain. Many areas south of the river have been marshy and low-lying, serviced by small rivulets and canals. Most submerged areas with floor-high water are on this part of the city, including the IT Park and many multinational corporate headquarters, paralysing business not only in Chennai but across the country and outside.

All the swamps, marsh lands, low-lying areas and streams that these big corporations, middle class housing and slums have built on are inundated as they are at the receiving end of overflowing large regional tanks.

The planned developments along the Adyar river that reduced its capacity as a water outlet are largely government-sponsored as the river bed was in government ownership. In the past three decades, massive housing, planned and unplanned, has cannibalised the river bed, leading to increased flooding, and damaged Chennai‚Äôs technology nerve centres and put millions of residents in danger. Chennai is indeed a sordid story of all the ills that plague India‚Äôs subservient planning system. Our inability to enforce environmental laws and insatiable greed for land grabbing by both national and international commercial interests are in full play in Chennai. The silver lining, however, is the enormous outflow of altruism, public mindedness and compassion Chennai‚Äôs citizens have displayed in the face of this calamity.

Pinning responsibility for faulty planning and political decisions, preparing a scientific watershed management plan, putting in place a disaster warning system, and addressing the immediate problems of the urban poor are the first steps forward. Chennai‚Äôs citizens have a resurgent spirit. That indeed is the human capital to build on.

Chennai is perhaps experiencing the worst impact of freak weather, but the city could have fared better had it protected and preserved its natural water bodies and drainage channels, experts at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said on Thursday.

The unprecedented deluge that Chennai has been subjected to is a reminder of increasing frequency of such freak weather events across the Indian sub-continent, they said.

Speaking on the subject, CSE director-general Sunita Narain said: ‚ÄúWe have repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that our urban sprawls such as Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Srinagar etc. have not paid adequate attention to the natural water bodies that exist in them. In Chennai, each of its lakes has a natural flood discharge channel which drains the spillover. But we have built over many of these water bodies, blocking the smooth flow of water. We have forgotten the art of drainage. We only see land for buildings, not for water.‚Äù

Waterbodies

CSE‚Äôs research shows that Chennai had more than 600 waterbodies in the 1980s, but a master plan published in 2008 said that only a fraction of the lakes could be found in a healthy condition. According to records of the State‚Äôs Water Resources Department, the area of 19 major lakes has shrunk from a total of 1,130 hectares (ha) in the 1980s to around 645 ha in the early 2000s, reducing their storage capacity. The drains that carry surplus water from tanks to other wetlands have also been encroached upon.

Stormwater drains The analysis also shows that the stormwater drains constructed to drain flood waters are clogged and require immediate desiltation. Chennai has only 855 km of stormwater drains against 2,847 km of urban roads. Thus, even a marginally heavy rainfall causes havoc in the city.

A number of cities including Chennai are both water-scarce as well as prone to flooding. Both problems are related ‚Äî excessive construction leads to poor recharge of groundwater aquifers and blocking of natural drainage systems.

Sushmita Sengupta, deputy programme manager with CSE‚Äôs water team, said: ‚ÄúWhile Chennai has been struggling to meet its water needs and has been even desalinating seawater at a huge expense, it allowed its aquifers to get depleted.‚Äù

Chennai‚Äôs human-made drainage is no replacement for its natural drainage systems ‚Äî a CSE analysis shows that there are natural canals and drains that directly connect the city with wetlands, waterbodies and rivers such as the Cooum and the Adyar that run through Chennai. The Cooum is supposed to collect surplus water from 75 tanks in its catchment area within the Chennai Metropolitan Area, while the Adyar is supposed to carry the surplus water of about 450 tanks in its catchment area and also from the Chembarambakkam tank (which is not in its catchment).

The rains in Chennai have broken a 100-year record (374 mm in just 24 hours). In November, the city had received 1,218 mm of rain, which was almost three times more than the average the city receives (407 mm).

A 2006 study by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune had said that extreme precipitation events were increasing in frequency and intensity in India during the period from 1950 to the 2000s.

‚ÄúThere is nowhere for the water to go because of unchecked building activity,‚Äù said VR Devika, who fled her ground-floor apartment to seek refuge with her upstairs neighbours.

‚ÄúAll the lake areas have been converted into housing colonies,‚Äù added the 61-year-old, who runs an arts charity.

What started out as a natural disaster in the state capital of Tamil Nadu soon became a more serious man-made one, with experts blaming bad urban planning and rampant ‚Äúencroachment‚Äù by fly-by-night property developers for making the situation worse.

Similar floods struck Mumbai in 2005 and Kashmir‚Äôs winter capital, Srinagar, last year. There, as in Chennai, construction blocked storm water channels and reduced the capacity of reservoirs designed to soak up unseasonal rains.

‚ÄúAs cities grow, with a nod and a wink, unauthorised construction along these channels and lakes chokes water flow,‚Äù said Shailesh Pathak, executive director at Bhartiya Group, which has its own smart city project in Bengaluru, runs a special economic zone and is expanding into low-cost housing.

Runway river

The sight of three dozen airliners with their undercarriages covered by flood waters might lead stranded passengers to wonder whether Chennai‚Äôs low-lying international airport was built in the wrong place.

Experts say they‚Äôd be right: One runway traverses the Adyar river, which burst its banks after some of the heaviest cloudbursts in the area in over a century swamped Chennai.

Some 270 people have died as a result of recent flooding and nearly 1,000 have been seriously injured.

‚ÄúThey have not made any provisions for preventing flood water from entering,‚Äù said Mohan Ranganathan, a Chennai aviation expert and former air safety adviser to the national government.

‚ÄúThe authorities and the airlines just have commercial and political interests in mind. Safety is the last avenue.‚Äù

While Chennai is not unique, experts say it was worse hit than the rest of India‚Äôs southeastern seaboard because of a development boom that has gone unchecked in the last 15 years.

‚ÄúChennai needs to relearn its water management,‚Äù said Sushmita Sengupta at the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi, adding that it was critical for the city to restore what had once been a good natural drainage system.

The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority has counted more than 150,000 illegal buildings in the city. Yet, despite several demolition orders issued by the Madras high Court, they still stand.

Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa Jayaram has described the flood damage as ‚Äúunavoidable‚Äù, according to TV reports.

It was not possible to reach the state government for comment, with mobile and landline networks knocked out by the floods in much of Chennai.

Making cities smarter

In July, 2005, 944mm of rain fell on Mumbai in a single day, leading to the deaths of 500 people. Heavy development had destroyed green spaces and mangrove forests, its natural flood protection, leaving the financial metropolis of 18 million reliant on an inadequate drainage system.

The city set itself an ambitious plan then to install pumping stations, widen drains and clean waterways. But that has missed deadlines, seen significant cost overruns and is running nearly a decade behind schedule.

Bhartiya‚Äôs Pathak said that under India‚Äôs weak federal framework, Modi alone lacked the power to realise his smart cities initiative that promises a hygienic, networked life for a rising generation of urban Indians.

Better would be to empower major cities to determine their own fate, he said, as with the most successful urban projects in China.

‚ÄúThe top Chinese megacities, where most growth has happened, are city states,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo would India consider city-state status, or sub-state status, for Chennai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Pune?‚Äù",issue,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",12-Nov-15,17-Nov-15,Chennai city and suburbs,490 mm (19.3 in),USD 2.2 billion,270,10 million people affected,"The floods were caused by heavy rainfall, which led to flooding of the Adyar river and its tributaries.

Today, Okhla has no freshwater, just untreated sewage. The extracts, on display at an exhibition on Past, Present and Future of Yamuna, are proof of the rich biodiversity along the Yamuna that had been wiped out completely.The gazetteers say even the highly threatened mahseer was found in plenty along with rohu, bachwa, mulley, mirga, kalabans and many others. The banks were infested with ""muggers-the gurriyal (critically endangered gharial) predominating"". But by the turn of this century, the Yamuna was transforming into a cesspool, affecting several communities.The exhibition, organised at INTACH by various organizations working on rivers, also highlights the decadal nature of floods in Delhi with the water level reaching beyond 206 metres at Old Railway Bridge in 1978, 1988, 1995, 2010 and 2013-the last one an aberration from the trend.

The data also shows this decade's major flood is still awaited,"" said Manoj Mishra of Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan.The 'Future' section highlights the need to revive the biodiversity. It calls for planting some important Yamuna species in degraded catchments and river-scape like sissu, butea and bahera. It also suggests developing a riverfront and improving water quality by phyto-remediation-treatment of water using aquatic plants, developing of river reservoirs and conservation of native biota.'Living off a dead river', a series published in TOI on communities dependent on the Yamuna for their livelihood, also features in the exhibition.Water minister Kapil Mishra, who attended the inauguration of the three-day exhibition on Saturday, said he would ensure that ""Yamuna would have bathing-quality water in three years."" Delhi, he added, doesn't need more water from external sources like Renuka dam or Sharda-Yamuna river link as its focus will be on recycling and reuse. Mishra also said the government had asked Delhi Jal Board (DJB) to shelve its Rs 20,000-crore sewerage master plan and instead work on the decentralized sewage treatment and recycle plan suggested by NGT.Activists and organizations working to save rivers in different states were also honoured at the event.

A report in NDTV quotes her as saying, ‚ÄúLosses are unavoidable when there's very heavy rain. Swift rescue and relief alone are indicators of a good government.‚Äù These words are intended to normalise a human-made disaster, and gloss over the pathology of urban development under successive administrations.It is quite usual for politicians and civic officials to blame so-called unprecedented rains for the civic and humanitarian crisis each monsoon brings, and decouple development from disaster. But unprecedented rains occur quite regularly in Chennai. As a city on the high-energy coast facing the Bay of Bengal, Chennai is no stranger to heavy rains and cyclonic storms. Chennai has experienced particularly heavy rains roughly once every 10 years ‚Äì 1969, 1976, 1985, 1996, 1998, 2005, 2015.



Sathyabama University was constructed in a water body on Old Mahabalipuram Road.

In fact, at 235 mm, last weekend's rainfall is not even the big daddy of big rains. The Nungambakkam rain gauge recorded 270 mm on October 27, 2005; 280 mm in 1969, and 450 mm in November 1976.Even in 1976, Adyar overflowed its banks and invaded first-floor houses. But those were the days when Chennai was derided for being an overgrown village, an underdeveloped aspirant to metropolitan status.Today, Chennai has a host of expensive infrastructure aimed at ushering in a ‚ÄúMake in Chennai‚Äù boom ‚Äì a brand-new (though leaky) airport built on the floodplains of the River Adyar, a sprawling bus terminal in flood-prone Koyambedu, a Mass Rapid Transit System constructed almost wholly over the Buckingham Canal and the Pallikaranai marshlands, expressways and bypass roads constructed with no mind to the tendency of water to flow, an IT corridor and a Knowledge Corridor consisting of engineering colleges constructed on waterbodies, and automobile and telecom SEZs and gated residential areas built on important drainage courses and catchments.

With every invitation to Make in Chennai, the city is unmaking itself and eroding its resilience to perfectly normal monsoon weather events. The infrastructure of big commerce has replaced the infrastructure to withstand natural shocks.The 2015 disaster was not just avoidable; it was a direct consequence of decisions pushed for by vested interests and conceded by town planners, bureaucrats and politicians in the face of wiser counsel.The case of the Pallikaranai marshlands, which drains water from a 250-square-kilometre catchment, is telling. Not long ago, it was a 50-square-kilometre water sprawl in the southern suburbs of Chennai. Now, it is 4.3 square kilometres ‚Äì less than a tenth of its original. The growing finger of a garbage dump sticks out like a cancerous tumour in the northern part of the marshland. Two major roads cut through the waterbody with few pitifully small culverts that are not up to the job of transferring the rain water flows from such a large catchment. The edges have been eaten into by institutes like the National Institute of Ocean Technology. Ironically, NIOT is an accredited consultant to prepare Environmental Impact Assessments on various subjects, including on the implications of constructing on waterbodies.Other portions of this wetland have been sacrificed to accommodate the IT corridor. But water offers no exemption to elite industry. Unmindful of the lofty intellectuals at work in the glass and steel buildings of the software parks, rainwater goes by habit to occupy its old haunts, bringing the back-office work of American banks to a grinding halt.The vast network of waterbodies that characterised Chennai can only be seen on revenue maps now. Of the 16 tanks belonging to the Vyasarpadi chain downstream of Retteri, none remain, according to Prof. M. Karmegam of Anna University Virtually every one of the flood-hit areas can be linked to ill-planned construction. The Chennai Bypass connecting NH45 to NH4 blocks the east flowing drainage causing flooding in Anna Nagar, Porur, Vanagaram, Maduravoyal, Mugappair and Ambattur. The Maduravoyal lake has shrunk from 120 acres to 25. Ditto with Ambattur, Kodungaiyur and Adambakkam tanks. The Koyambedu drain and the surplus channels from Korattur and Ambattur tanks are missing. Sections of the Veerangal Odai connecting Adambakkam tank to Pallikaranai are missing. The South Buckingham Canal from Adyar creek to Kovalam creek has been squeezed from its original width of 25 metres to 10 metres in many places due to the Mass Rapid Transit System railway stations. Important flood retention structures such as Virugambakkam, Padi and Villivakkam tanks are officially abandoned.Before political rivalry between the two Dravidian parties brought it to a midway halt, an ill-advised Elevated Express freight corridor from Chennai harbour to Maduravoyal had already reclaimed a substantial portion of the Cooum's southern bank drastically reducing the flood-carrying capacity of the river.Remarkably, all these causes were listed out by the government's own officials at a seminar on waterways organised by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority in 2010. But there seems to be many a slip between enlightened understanding and enlightened action.The Second Masterplan prepared by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority glibly authorises built-up spaces with no regard to hydrology. In the Ennore region, the authority has reclassified waterbodies, intertidal zones and mangrove swamps as ‚ÄúSpecial and Hazardous Industries‚Äù and handed it over to the Kamarajar Port Ltd.In Ponneri, a town in a rural part of Chennai Metropolitan Area, developers are executing Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority-approved plans with no regard to drainage. Last weekend, Ponneri received 370 mm of rain ‚Äì 135 mm more than Chennai did. While it suffered from flooding, damage to property and life was not high. Ponneri is slotted to be developed as a Smart City. But will our dumb engineers be able to build a smart city?",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

The flooding of Saidapet last week has left many wondering if the nearby underground Chennai Metro Rail station will be deluged should another disaster of this kind strike the city again.

Officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) said the flooding of the site occurred because it was under construction and that this would not happen when the stations and tunnels were complete.

‚ÄúWe are constructing the station at a height of about 1.2-1.5 metres above the road; so this may not happen. We are initiating other precautionary measures too,‚Äù he added.

10 days

It might take another 10 days for them to pump out water from the site after the recent flooding, he said. ‚ÄúWe are using motors of 100-150 HP to pump out water from the site,‚Äù he added.

But another official noted the underground stations were equipped to handle normal monsoon rains with facilities to drain water; but should a flooding like this happen, it might not be possible to operate the stations.

Urban planning experts too echo the view that it may not be possible to avoid deluge of an underground station. ‚ÄúIf the tunnel starts at the mouth of a river, then there are ways of shutting it; but rarely do people take such precautions,‚Äù an urban planning expert, seeking anonymity, said.

Also, there are questions emerging on whether the tunnel itself led out water from the Adyar into various areas, subsequently causing flooding there.

‚ÄúIt may have led water into some areas like Teynampet and T. Nagar; but the impact would have been far worse if the tunnel had not taken in large quantities of water from the flooding river,‚Äù an official said.

But urban planning experts say one cannot buy this argument.

‚ÄúThe tunnel could not have definitely reduced the flooding; it can take only a fraction of the quantity of water released by the river,‚Äù he added.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The people wrote scathing tweets, heckled senior ministers and sat on roads to register their anger. Here are nine things that irked the citizens of the Tamil Nadu capital:

1. Jayalaithaa stickers

2. No milk, abundant liquor supply

While people were deprived of essential commodities like milk and clean drinking water, a service that continued unaffected was of liquor supply.

According to The News Minute, liquor shops in Nungambakkam, Choolaimedu, Anna Nagar and Arumbakkam have been functioning from 11am to 10pm for the past week.

3. Lack of co-ordination

According to a report published in The Hindu, army rescue personnel were kept waiting by government officials as they failed to convey where to deliver the relief materials or where rescue operations were needed.

The officials allegedly failed to provide facilities for the army personnel to transport people they managed to rescue from inundated places.

4. Tragedy at MIOT hospital

A massive row broke out at MIOT hospitals amid reports that 14 patients died reportedly after heavy rain flooded the generator room and snapped oxygen supply to those on life support.

Angry relatives thronged the MIOT hospital, accusing officials of negligence and hiding the news for several hours, though the state government said the deaths were not caused by power outage and had occurred before December 3 while families failed to collect the bodies because of the floods.

5. Government apathy

Anger spread on the streets when senior ministers Natham Viswanathan, Sellur Raju and Gokul Indira visited RK Nagar, chief minister Jayalalithaa‚Äôs constituency, where people heckled them, forcing them to hastily leave.

Similar scenes were witnessed in other areas where people vented their anger at officials complaining of lack of help from authorities. A large group of residents surrounded a police patrol team on Friday night and demanded to know when water and electricity supplies would be back on.

The ministers and officials who were present at a press conference on Sunday, which was the first major briefing since the floods struck, read from long prepared statements, made even longer by the number of times the name of ‚ÄòAmma‚Äô was invoked.

They refused to answer questions from journalists and staged a walkout.

6. Lake breach rumours

Social media websites were abuzz with rumours started by miscreants. Most of the rumours were about lakes which were ‚Äòabout to be breached‚Äô and the panic-mongering continues till Monday. Verified social media accounts and local media have been tweeting constantly to dispel such rumours.

7. Crocodile rumour

News about crocodiles escaping from the Madras Crocodile Bank in Mamallapuram did the rounds on social media and WhatsApp, spreading fear among residents.

8. Plea for reinstating IAS officer

Netizens rallied behind IAS officer Vijay Pingale, who was transferred in 2014, just three days after he named contractors who botched up road work in Chennai.

Support for him also poured out on Twitter and Facebook with netizens using the hashtag #RecallPingale to express their anger and resentment against the sudden transfer.

Netizens claimed that Pingale had warned about the floods in the past and would have handled the situation much better if he had not been transferred.

9. WhatsApp rumour about a Nasa report

A WhatsApp message asking people in Chennai to leave the city immediately as a Nasa report had predicted very heavy rain in the next 72 hours circulated among residents, spreading fear and panic. It claimed that the entire city would get submerged.

Here is the message

The lack of warning of the impending floods in Chennai made it especially difficult for people with disabilities, who were left to fend for themselves. While some needed rescuing, others lost essential implements like hearing aids, crutches and calipers, leaving them more vulnerable than ever before.

The disaster, however, did bring to the fore incredible stories of courage and grit, where ordinary citizens became heroes as they helped save lives.

One such story is that of physically challenged teacher K.S. Mariappan, who rescued four mentally challenged students from a special school as water gushed into the campus.

December 1 seemed like just another rainy night to the students at the Annai Special School, located on the banks of the Adyar river in Saidapet. The inmates had retired to bed after dinner, as had Mariappan, who also lived on the school premises.

Around 9 p.m., Pratap, one of the students who noticed the water seeping into the school, rushed to Mr. Mariappan‚Äôs quarters to wake him up.

Jolted into action, Mr. Mariappan took a call to move the students out of the school to the home of a teacher who lived a kilometre away. By the time they had collected a few essentials and started out of the school on Mr. Mariappan‚Äôs retro-fitted bike, the water in the school campus was ankle-deep. Since he suffers from polio, and depends on his crutches to move about, the swirling waters posed a huge challenge for Mr. Marippan, especially as he had to escort others to safety.

‚ÄúTo reach the house, we walked around half a kilometre. Walking through the flooded streets on my crutches meant that the progress was slow, and I had to accompany each student individually,‚Äù he said.

After he escorted the last student, Subhash, to safety, Mr. Marippan went back to his bike to collect the certificates and other essentials that he had managed to save from the water. ‚ÄúBy this time the flood waters had reached my chest, and I could no longer walk through the swirling waters. I somehow managed to hold on to my crutches, but I had to be carried by bystanders to prevent me from being washed away,‚Äù he explains.

For the next three days, the group was forced to live with one of the teachers, with very little food, almost no medical care, and two special instructors to manage four distressed students.

A similarly harrowing situation played out in Nandambakkam, where the students of MGR School for Hearing Impaired were stranded on their campus, and were rescued by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Many of the students lost their hearing aids and certificates.

Official figures state that 11.7 lakh persons with disabilities live in the State (around 1.7 per cent of the population). Estimates suggest that the Chennai metropolitan area alone has over 1.5 lakh disabled people. About two months ago, Vidyasagar, a city NGO working with the disabled, wrote a letter to the State Disaster Management Authority headed by the Chief Secretary, asking it to include the needs of people with disabilities when making a disaster management plan.

‚ÄúThe letter, which was sent in October, asked that persons with disabilities be included on the panel of the authority so that they could better explain the issues faced during natural disasters,‚Äù Smitha Sadasivam from Vidyasagar said. So far, there has been no response from the authority.

In a disturbing coincidence, the floods ravaged the city soon after the letter was sent, and seemed to only emphasise the need to include the disabled when coming up with a strategy for disaster management.

The case of Bhavana, who has cerebral palsy and lives in Sriram Nagar Colony with her parents and caregiver, is one example which highlights the crucial need for rescue teams to have adequate training to deal with people with special needs.

Bhavana is wheelchair-bound, and is unable to speak. When the river water started flooding her house, her caregiver managed to signal for a boat to rescue them. But when the team arrived, they realised that Bhavana would have to be transported in her wheelchair. One of the members of the rescue team says, ‚ÄúAfter trying several different methods, we had to ask her mother and her caregiver to wade through the water and help carry her on to the boat, since none of us had the training needed to undertake such an operation.‚Äù The fact that civilian-led rescue teams, even though they meant only good had no experience to anticipate such situations, compounded rescue efforts.

Amba Salelkar of Inclusive Planet Centre for Disability Law and Policy, emphasises the need for disaster management policies to ensure people who are visually or hearing impaired receive warning messages, and that people with mobility impediments are rescued. Only then will these policies be comprehensive, she says.

Trapped in the floods

While people in danger were rescued from their homes, a majority of the city remained indoors for a few days, with telephone lines failing, no electricity and the streets continuing to be flooded with water.

Many of the inmates of Vidyasagar were in a similar situation. With no electricity, and many of the people on wheelchairs, they were all forced to stay on the third floor of the school building. This dealt a blow especially to those who got around using electronic wheelchairs, which could not be charged, due to the prolonged blackout in the area. As a result, they were unable to even use the toilet without someone carrying them. Since there were very few caregivers, the situation became dire.

Medical care for people with special needs also became a problem during the floods. Ms. Sadasivam herself was stranded in her house with viral fever. ‚ÄúI have multiple sclerosis, and I am on immunosuppressants, which means that I cannot take many over-the-counter medicines,‚Äù she explains.

Attempts at rebuilding Now that much of the water has receded, the focus is on the city and its people trying to rebuild themselves. K. Manivasan, Commissioner, Disabilities, government of Tamil Nadu, says, ‚ÄúThe government has ensured that all the camps have a special officer who is taking care of people with disabilities. Wherever possible, we are issuing certificates immediately.‚Äù

A disaster that was termed as a leveller, in terms of its effect on people of all social classes, was still a great deal harder on people with disabilities, who have, in the past, lobbied for better accessibility in the city. Activists and people with disabilities alike hope that the floods, disastrous as it was, would jolt the government into finally taking their cause more seriously.

CHENNAI: While heavy rain left several commuters in Chennai fuming about the unavailability of cabs, Ola, the cab aggregator, went one step ahead, deploying boats in flooded areas in the city.Ola might have got the idea of deploying boats from innumerable memes on the social media -- that Ola was providing boats for transportation in waterlogged Chennai.Anand Subramanian, senior director of marketing communications, Ola, said: ""More than the idea, the execution itself was a challenge. Sourcing rowers and boats, training them on the objective of the exercise and getting them to be available in the waterlogged areas were key to making this possible.""Partnering with local fishermen and professional rowers, Ola deployed boats in areas that were heavily waterlogged or partially submerged based on information available from fire and rescue department of Tamil Nadu.Did deployment of boats serve any purpose? The company transported ‚Äúseveral people‚Äù from waterlogged areas. Over Tuesday and Wednesday, areas like Velachery, Perumbakkam, Saidapet, Thoraipakkam, Nandambakkam, Semmancherry and Mudichur were covered.Boats were also deployed for distribution of essential supplies like water and food.The boats served another purpose. Cab providers and cab aggregators refused to take bookings when heavy rain was lashing the city. This was mainly because of waterlogging in several areas of the city and unavailability of drivers.Using the boats, Ola rehabilitated its drivers and their families, who were stranded in their homes without food and electricity. Ola located such driver families and supplied them with essential food supplies and sets of emergency lanterns.This way Ola got the drivers to ply their cars, thus meeting the heavy demand for cabs in the city.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,severe

Skymet Weather Team

Heavy rains have triggered flash floods in at least four villages of Leh district in Jammu and Kashmir. However, no casualties have been reported so far. Affected villages included Shakti, Vanilla, Basigo and Chuchut.

As per media reports, several houses and property were damaged, amounting to substantial loss.

In span of 48 hours till 8.30 am on Sunday, Leh district has recorded 24.6 mm of rain. According to Skymet Meteorology Division in India, a fresh Western Disturbance is over North Pakistan and adjoining Jammu and Kashmir which has caused the rainfall activity over the district. And, we expect light to moderate rain to continue for next 24 to 48 hours that will further worsen the situation.

According to the meteorologists at Skymet, it is very difficult to predict the weather over the region as mountainous terrain responds very quickly to any change in weather.

As per geographical features, Leh valley is surrounded by mountains. It is quite a possibility that villages have been inundated by heavy rain taking place in nearby region.

The area of surveillance is also very limited, since radar‚Äôs view is obstructed by the mountains due to which the satellite is not able to send the farsighted images.

If climate change is indeed the culprit, then the Chennai floods should come as a severe warning to authorities since there could be many more such episodes in the near future across the country. And the only way to minimise the deleterious impacts of such wayward climate changes would be to make Indian cities climate resilient.

But to just blame climate change-induced heavy rain alone for the chaos in Chennai would be wrong. Like Kashmir (2014) and Uttarakhand (2013), Chennai was also as much a man-made disaster as it was a climate disaster.

In its rush to develop, the government and urban planners have completely destroyed its vast network of water bodies that would soak in extra water in case of heavy rainfall and the natural drainage system. The city‚Äôs largest mall, Phoenix, is on a lake-bed ‚Äî Velachery. The Second Masterplan of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority also has scant regard for hydrology, claim experts.

By 2031, India‚Äôs urban population is projected to increase by more than 200 million to 600 million, or 40% of the national population.

Indian cities must build resilience so that they can withstand such natural shocks and become more appealing to do business and attract talent. But building resilience, as Judith Rodin, president of The Rockefeller Foundation, says, is not a sprint or even a marathon.

It‚Äôs a relay race. And that must begin in right earnest now to ensure that every disruption does not become a disaster.

According to a notice issued by the irrigation department on January 15, cities have to demarcate river beds within their limits that have experienced floods even once in 50 years as floodplains. In rural areas, the state will have to mark as floodplains those areas that have faced floods even once in 25 years. According to a notice issued by the irrigation department on January 15, cities have to demarcate river beds within their limits that have experienced floods even once in 50 years as floodplains. In rural areas, the state will have to mark as floodplains those areas that have faced floods even once in 25 years.



The notice is a major win for applicants of an ongoing litigation at the green court, with environmentalist

on one side and the UP environment ministry, irrigation department, police, NCT of Delhi and Haryana water resources ministry on the other. It was filed in April 2013, under sections 14 and 15 of the National Green Tribunal Act, to demand removal of illegal constructions along the Yamuna and restitution of the Yamuna and Hindon river systems by respondents.

""Marking of floodplains along Yamuna and Hindon is key to stopping illegal constructions. Recent Kashmir and Uttarkhand floods were all due to riverbed encroachments. These have to stop,"" said Amit Khemka, Vashisht's advocate.

The Yamuna floodplain demarcation will spell doom for hundreds of farmhouses in Gautam Budh Nagar and factories along Hindon in Ghaziabad. Demolition of the constructions along the bed could soon be in order. According to the application, a floodplain is the land along a river that has gone underwater during a '100-year flood', defined as flooding at least once in a 100-year period.

""Floodplains are an integral part of a river's ecosystem. Land sharks have illegally sold-off large parts of Yamuna's floodplains in UP, Delhi and Haryana as plots and farmhouses, and almost the entire stretch along Hindon, especially in Ghaziabad and GB Nagar districts. Daily, lakhs of bricks are brought into the Hindon and Yamuna floodplains and used to illegally raise permanent structures. Concretizing such an eco-sensitive zone has far-reaching implications,"" the application said.

The application said 4,000 acres of Yamuna floodplains have been usurped in Noida. Farmhouses and plants for crushing, hot-mix, concrete ready-mix and quartzite-washing have come up inside the river bed in the middle of the river's main stream.

""Colonies have come up in villages like Karhera, Nand Gram, Ghukna, Sihani, Saddiqnagar, Noornagar, Arthala, Kanawani, Chhajarsi, etc, along Hindon in Ghaziabad and Yamuna in GB Nagar. Floodplains have also been concretized in villages like Dostpur Mangrauli Bangar, Shafipur, etc, in the Hindon-Yamuna doab bund,"" it read.

""Urban settlements, encroachments and development in upstream areas of reservoirs/water bodies and aquifer recharge areas that pose a potential threat of contamination

, should be strictly regulated,"" the prayer stated.

The fate of the illegal constructions will be decided in the next hearing of the case in the NGT, the date for which is not yet fixed. But they are clearly on borrowed time.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
delhi,2015,https://kashmirlife.net/history-gagged-issue-25-vol-07-84538/,07-Sep-15,History Gagged,"The skewed coverage of Kashmir floods by Delhi media generated massive ire and suspicion against journalists, preventing even local media from recording their own history, reports Muhammad A Raafi

Photojournalists in Kashmir are a daredevil lot. They are used to situations that demand extraordinary courage and grit. But 2014 floods were different. They not only braved gushing waters but angry natives too to chronicle flood. Perhaps that is why a mere mention of September 2014 saddens Javed Dar, photojournalist working with Xinhua, China‚Äôs official News Agency.

‚ÄúWe missed to record our history,‚Äù Javed grieves. During floods, lot of events couldn‚Äôt receive the media coverage as photographers had to retreat in face of an irate public. Reason? The coverage by the Delhi based media that sought to glorify the ‚Äúmagnanimity‚Äù of armed forces has upset people across the spectrum.

People alleged that it overlooked massive rescue efforts by the local youth who risked their lives to save the marooned flood-victims. The ‚Äúpartial‚Äù coverage generated both fury and disappointment among Kashmiris leading them to eye everyone involved with media with suspicion.

‚ÄúWe used to hide our cameras in empty sandbags and shot only when it felt safe,‚Äù Javed recalls who is working since last 12 years. ‚ÄúOnce, while covering the rescue work by locals, who were evacuating pregnant ladies and new born infants from Lal Ded hospital, I was punched many times.‚Äù

Assuming that Javed worked for the Delhi media, local rescuers didn‚Äôt let him take pictures.

Habib Naqash, one of the senior most photojournalist of Kashmir, who has faced many life threatening situations during his twenty year long career, vividly recalls the events of September 2014.

As floods roared their way in, Naqash got trapped in his Press Enclave residence for four days and three nights. ‚ÄúIt couldn‚Äôt have been worse,‚Äù he says.

Next day Mehraj-ud-Din, a fellow photojournalist called Naqash to check if he is alright. ‚ÄúBy his tone I could sense that he was in trouble,‚Äù Mehraj says. Naqash had been sobbing and saying that this could be the last time ‚Äúwe are talking.‚Äù

Mehraj was among a few photojournalists who could work on September 7, the day Srinagar was submerged. ‚ÄúIt was chaotic everywhere. It was impossible to move from one place to another. We hung on a truck‚Äôs back to reach Bemina,‚Äù recalls Mehraj.

After crossing many hurdles, Mehraj and his team managed to reach the Srinagar airport where an army officer agreed to let them board his helicopter to cover floods. ‚ÄúBut due to the objections by Delhi media personnel we were disallowed.‚Äù

With mobile and internet services down, it was impossible for journalists to send dispatches to their respective media houses.

However, luckily, the broadband connection at Mehraj‚Äôs home was working. ‚ÄúI took nearly twenty journalists to my home and we started working from there. We would go to the field during the day and return in the evening and dispatch whatever we had covered. They stayed at my home for 7 days,‚Äù he says.

There were instances when Mehraj and his friends had to face public ire ‚ÄúMany times my camera was snatched.‚Äù

But keeping up the hope, Mehraj and his team continued covering whatever little ‚Äúhistory‚Äù they could while squandering most of it.

Naqash‚Äôs account, however, differs. As soon as he slipped out from his flooded residence, he immediately rushed to fellow journalist Aman Farooq‚Äôs home and got back to work.

‚ÄúWe were appreciated by the locals for working tirelessly. We didn‚Äôt face objections from anyone. People cooperated and even the local rescuers allowed us to travel in their boats to cover the devastation.‚Äù

Naqash‚Äôs friend Aman, however admitted that due to filtered coverage by the Delhi media, people did initially become hostile, but once their credentials were established, they would let them work.

Many photojournalists express contentment with the way people used their mobile phones to shoot videos and later shared them on social media. ‚ÄúThey covered something that even professional journalists wouldn‚Äôt have been able to cover.‚Äù

Bilal Bahadur, a photojournalist who works with a weekly magazine, feels it was really difficult to even take out the camera. Bilal blames Delhi media‚Äôs ‚Äúdistorted‚Äù coverage of floods for such reaction from public. ‚ÄúPeople would get angry at the sight of a camera. Many journalists were abused and even thrashed by locals,‚Äù says Bilal.

For first three days Bilal couldn‚Äôt click even a single picture fearing he might be attacked by people.

Farooq Javed Khan, another reputed photojournalist, who covered pre-flood scenes extensively till he got trapped inside his house in Karan Nagar with his family. ‚ÄúWe were rescued after two days.‚Äù

Once safe, Farooq along with his colleagues tried to reach uptown areas, but failed. ‚ÄúThen we made a detour through Chattabal area. We wanted to see what has happened to Lal Chowk, Rajbagh etc.‚Äù

On their way, Farooq and his friends made many attempts to click pictures but faced serious objections from the locals.

‚ÄúSome upper-class people didn‚Äôt want to be filmed or photographed because they felt it would be insulting to them,‚Äù says Farooq, adding that they were not even allowed to photograph inside mosques where many elite class families had taken refuge.

A major part of our history has remained grossly uncovered. We cannot revisit those times now, Farooq says. ‚ÄúIt would have been great source of information to our future generations.‚Äù

We keep hearing about floods that had swept everything probably a century ago. But, we curse those times because people didn‚Äôt have resources to capture things that time, Mehraj says. ‚ÄúBut how will we respond to our future generations. In spite of being loaded with modern gadgets we couldn‚Äôt capture the major part of floods,‚Äù he asks. ‚ÄúWill they not curse us?‚Äù",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Forget bringing us things and giving us help ‚Äì no one has even come to ask ‚Äòhow are you‚Äôll doing?‚Äô, ‚Äòare you‚Äôll safe?‚Äô, ‚Äòare you‚Äôll alive?‚Äô‚Äù L Pavai was in tears as she spoke of the neglect her hamlet ‚Äì Ambedkar Nagar in the Parangipettai block of Cuddalore district ‚Äì during the rains and floods of the past month.



There are 45 houses in Ambedkar Nagar of which only 11 are made of concrete. There others are all mud and thatch structures. On the night of November 10, as the rest of the country was caught up in Diwali festivities, Ambedkar Nagar, along with large parts of Cuddalore experienced its worst flooding in a century. The district got 50% more rainfall on November 9, 10 and 11 than the normal rainfall for the entire month of November.



As water rushed in from a nearby river, some of the mud houses were completely washed away. Others were severely damaged. As the rain continued for the rest of the month and into December, the stubborn waters refused to recede from the streets and houses of Ambedkar Nagar. Residents like A Subramaniam say that little help has come to them and they have nowhere to go.



‚ÄúMy wife, five children and I have been staying here only,‚Äù said Subramaniam, who had to wade through shin-deep water to enter his house a month after the first floods, when at least two feet of water entered his house through the thatched back wall and destroyed, among his other belongings, his refrigerator. Subramaniam acquired a plastic poster from a nearby temple to cover the gaping hole in the back wall.

‚ÄúMy feet are full of sethu punnu from walking around in all this water,‚Äù Subramanian said while displaying the wounds on his feet due to intertrigo, a condition in which sores develop due to bacterial or fungal infection of moist skin. When asked if he had reached out to authorities or other people in the district for help, Subramanian only said quietly, ‚ÄúNo relief material has come to us. We can‚Äôt go and ask anyone also.‚Äù



Dalit villages like Ambedkar Nagar have not only been the hardest hit by the floods, they have also been excluded from relief operations, according to a report by the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights and the Social Awareness Society for Youth in Tamil Nadu. The report, based on a survey of 8,400 houses in Cuddalore district, found that out of 1,337 houses that were damaged 1,276 belonged to Dalits. Among the 433 acres of crop lost, 378 belonged to Dalits.



This unequal damage, the report says, is due to the fact that Dalit settlements are relegated to low-lying areas near rivers, streams or canals at an average distance of 1.5 kilometers from the main villages they are attached to. Ambedkar Nagar, for example, is located on the near the Kollidam river about half kilometer away from the main Kavarapattu village that consists of about 400 Kallar households, a Most Backward Caste group. Ambedkar Nagar residents said they hadn‚Äôt received any warning about flooding in their area or a visit from any government official in the aftermath.



Subramaniam and his neighbours have been left in the cold when it comes to aid because of the inherent caste-bias among government officials too, according to Pandiyan Kamal, director of the Social Awareness Society for Youth. ‚ÄúWhenever disaster occurs, Dalit people are excluded from relief assessment and emergency response,‚Äù he said. The report also alleges that political strongmen in neighbouring villages are blocking the flow of relief material into Ambedkar Nagar.



‚ÄúEven if we ask for help, when we say we are in Kavarapattu, they won‚Äôt come. I don‚Äôt know why they are scared to come,‚Äù said Pavai.



Flood after flood after flood



This isn‚Äôt the first time that Ambedkar Nagar has battled flood waters. When the tsunami hit in 2004, the waters flooded the village and receded in a day. Then came Cyclone Nisha in 2006 and then Cyclone Thane in 2011, each one slamming into the village. Most of the 11 concrete houses that have been built or are under construction are from the funds allotted for rehabilitation of Cyclone Thane‚Äôs victims.

‚ÄúEach household gets Rs 120,000 to build a concrete house but the money can only be claimed after submitting the bills,‚Äù said Pavai, who is the cluster leader of a grassroots federation called Inaindha Kaigal ‚Äì joined hands ‚Äì set up by the Social Awareness Society for Youth. ‚ÄúSo people here are slowly building their houses from their savings. For some people, building has been going on for more than three years. They build a little more each time they have saved up enough.‚Äù



Near the entrances of the few houses completely constructed from Cyclone Thane funds, are mandatory pictures of Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa.

Kalkunam village in the Kurinjipadi block west of Parangipettai was one of the worst affected villages this season, registering two deaths and at least 250 houses of its 300 houses destroyed. ‚ÄúFor at least a week, we were in the same clothes,‚Äù said John Bose, who lives on the Dalit and Christian side of Kalkunam. ‚ÄúWe normally get 20 kilos of free rice from the ration shop. We are making full use of that. For vegetables we are making do with whatever little comes from the NGOs.‚Äù Aid has started trickling into Kalkunam since local press started reporting the destruction, but only after Chennai had its worst rains in the beginning of December.





Jasmine Mary has been living in the community hall of Kalkunam church with her seven-month baby and son attending third standard at the local school. She has been struggling to get by on the Rs 3,000 compensation the government has given her for her destroyed hut. ‚ÄúI have already spent Rs 1,500 to buy my son‚Äôs school books that got washed off in the rain. Then there is milk for the baby and lots of other things.‚Äù







The remains of Jasmine Mary‚Äôs house



While the people in Kalkunam are struggling to get back on their feet, those in Ambedkar Nagar don‚Äôt even now how. Ambedkar Nagar hasn‚Äôt got the meager attention or compensation that Kalkunam has. It has neither a house of worship or a community hall to serve as temporary shelter. Families are scrounging for any sort of covering to lay on still damp floors before they sleep.



More than ten years ago, the families of Ambedkar Nagar lived on higher ground but were moved to their present location to make way for a road. ‚ÄúFor the last four or five years, every time the water comes, it‚Äôs same problem over and over again,‚Äù said Pavai. ‚ÄúIn this place, there isn‚Äôt even space to bury our bodies when we die.‚Äù

On Friday, Gujarat‚Äôs health ministry reported at least 70 deaths across the state, although disaster management officials claim that the figure is exaggerated.‚ÄúSo far 45 people have died in the floods, 13,000 have been evacuated and eight people are still missing in Amreli and Rajkot districts,‚Äù said Bipin Bhatt, the director of relief and rescue operations in Gujarat. ‚ÄúOur electricity board is working day and night to restore power to areas that are cut off, but otherwise the rains have stopped now and the flood situation is very much under control.‚ÄùAmreli, by all accounts, has been the worst affected, where 33 people have died and 600 inundated villages are now dependent on the National Disaster Relief Force and the Indian Air Force for food and other humanitarian aid. The forested areas of southern Amreli are also home to many Asiatic lions of the Gir wildlife sanctuary, and in the midst of all the chaos, forest authorities have been concerned about their safety.On June 25, residents of Amreli‚Äôs Bavadi village discovered the body of a lioness floating in the murky flood waters of a farm. As many as 50 lions had been living near the villages around Bavadi, on the banks of the river Shetrunji that had overflowed during the heavy rains.Forest officials have sent out teams to reach out to those villages, but have not officially attributed the lioness‚Äôs death to the floods. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know for sure how the lioness died ‚Äì she could have been diseased,‚Äù said an official from the Gujarat government‚Äôs department of forests. ‚ÄúFrom our side we are trying to pump out the water from the areas where lions live. And we are trying to provide them with food by making sure that the animals they prey on ‚Äì like cheetal ‚Äì do not fall ill.‚ÄùConcern about the lions‚Äô flooded habitats increased after a video of a lion walking along a national highway in Gujarat hit the news channels on June 24. The cell phone video was shot by a passing commuter and has been perceived as a sign of wildcats attempting to escape flooded forest areas.Some wildlife conservationists, however, believe that people are getting too carried away with their concern for the survival of Gir‚Äôs lions. The Asiatic lion is undoubtedly and endangered species ‚Äì there are only 523 of them left, almost all of them in Gir ‚Äì but they are very unlikely to drown in the floods.‚ÄúThe Gir national park has got a lot of elevations and hills that lions retreat to when it floods, so this is not new,‚Äù said K Ramesh, a scientist at the Wildlife Institute of India. ‚ÄúThere is also nothing new about spotting a lion along a highway, especially since their population has been increasing.‚ÄùFlooding is a risk to all animals, but wildlife is far more likely to perish in flood plains like the ones at the Kaziranga wildlife sanctuary in Assam.‚ÄúIn Kaziranga, many animals do die during floods, and many move to another, hillier sanctuary nearby,‚Äù said Anish Andheria, president of the non-profit Wildlife Conservation Trust. ‚ÄúSome amount of mortality for various reasons is natural, but lions have survived through many floods and can look after themselves.‚ÄùWhile the Saurashtra floods need not be a major cause of worry for India‚Äôs lions, there are some who believe the risk posed to the animals is a good reminder of the fact that the Gir forests are the only natural home for endangered lions in the country.‚ÄúThe floods are a reminder that we need to translocate some lions to other sanctuaries so that they can survive outside Gir as well,‚Äù said Ravi Chellam, a senior wildlife conservationist. ‚ÄúRight now, we are putting all our eggs in the same basket.‚Äù",issue,Gujarat floods,"Gujarat, India",23-06-2022,26-06-2022,"['Amreli district', 'Rajkot district', 'Bhavnagar district', 'Junagadh district', 'Kutch district']","['Amreli: 300 mm', 'Rajkot: 250 mm', 'Bhavnagar: 200 mm', 'Junagadh: 150 mm', 'Kutch: 100 mm']","['600 villages inundated', '13,000 people evacuated', '8 people missing', '45 people dead']",,"['Destruction of homes and infrastructure', 'Loss of crops and livestock', 'Disruption of transportation and communication', 'Health risks due to water contamination']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The report, written by energy analysts and experts from the UK, the US, China and India, and released worldwide, comes five months before a summit on climate change in Paris in December, where government leaders are expected to strike a new global climate deal.

The report said climate change could increase the appeal of terrorism in weak and failing states while highlighting that even in the current scenario, some nations are already struggling to provide the basic needs of their populations, leading to further marginalization of populations where the appeal of terrorism is stronger.

It also warned that in the future, climatic conditions could exceed potentially lethal limits of heat stress, even for individuals resting in the shade.

The report highlighted increasing risk and probability of severe flooding, large risks to global food security with unprecedented price spikes, extreme water stress leading to water conflicts and unprecedented migration.

‚ÄúAs high rates of global population growth are increasing demand, climate change could further reduce already stressed resources, especially in conflict regions. This could significantly increase the risks of state failures, food restrictions, civil unrest, large-scale migration and internal security hazards,"" the report added.

The report, an international independent assessment of the risks of climate change, was commissioned by UK government. The experts assessed how emissions would rise, the direct risks on health, food yields, coastal flooding and water stress, and the systemic risks to human systems‚Äîconflict and international security concerns, migration, humanitarian assistance, state capacity and state failure.

The authors of the report include the UK special representative for climate change David King, Harvard University‚Äôs Center for the Environment director Daniel P. Schrag, China‚Äôs National Expert Committee on Climate Change member Zhou Dadi, CEO of Indian think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water Arunabha Ghosh and senior fellow of the Brookings Institution, a US think tank, Qi Ye. They have written the report in their independent capacities.

The report said that the incidence of extreme drought affecting cropland could increase by about 50% in the US and South Asia, threatening food security.

It further cautioned that if the world warms by 4 degrees Celsius, in northern India‚ÄîRajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh‚Äîthere is a 30% probability that temperatures will be so high that even moderate or heavy outdoor work cannot be carried out in the hottest months.

‚ÄúThere is about a 40% chance that individuals in northern India will not be able to participate in competitive outdoor activities in summertime when global average temperatures have risen on average by one degree compared to the present,"" said the report.

It also had a note of caution regarding food security, saying a ‚Äú1 in 100 year"" shock to global food production in the latter half of the 20th century may become three times more likely by the mid-21st century.

The report found that migration from some regions of the world could become ‚Äúmore a necessity than a choice"" and that the risks of state failure could rise significantly, affecting many countries simultaneously, including those that are currently considered developed and stable.

‚ÄúMigration could take place on a historically unprecedented scale. It seems likely that the capacity of the international community for humanitarian assistance would be overwhelmed,"" the report said.

‚ÄúThe most important decision any government has to make about climate change is one of priority: how much effort to expend on countering it, relative to the effort that must be spent on other issues. This risk assessment aims to inform that decision,"" said Ghosh.

delhi,2015,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/hjUVTrwyI0I4p4b4enBg1K/India-tops-list-of-nations-at-risk-from-floods.html,06-Mar-15,India tops list of nations at risk from floods,"If you thought India has no respite from relentless flood fury, you‚Äôre spot on.

According to the World Resources Institute (WRI), India tops the list of 163 nations affected by river floods in terms of number of people.

Every year, the lives of 4.85 million Indians are disrupted by floods. At risk: $14.3 billion of gross domestic product.

The analysis says with climate change and socio-economic development accelerating, the risk is bound to increase in the years ahead and river flooding will affect more people and wreak more damage by 2030.

As per the analysis, river flooding could affect 21 million people and expose $96 billion in GDP worldwide each year but by 2030, these numbers could grow to 54 million people and $521 billion in GDP affected every year.

India is followed by Bangladesh with 3.47 million people facing flood risk every year, China with 3.27 million, Vietnam with 0.92 million and Pakistan with 0.71 million people.

The numbers were generated with a new tool, the Aqueduct Global Flood Analyzer, which quantifies and visualizes the reality of global flood risk.

The tool estimates current and future potential exposed GDP, affected population and urban damage from river floods for every state, country and major river basin in the world.

WRI co-developed the tool with four Dutch research organizations: Deltares, the Institute for Environmental Studies of the VU University Amsterdam, Utrecht University and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.

As per the WRI study, the top 15 countries in the list accounts for nearly 80% of the total population affected every year; these countries are all considered least developed or developing.

Among high-income countries, roughly 167,000 people are affected every year in the US, which is the highest-ranked high-income country in the list.

As per WRI, a clear trend that emerges across the world from their study is that ‚Äúin lower and middle-income countries, socio-economic development is expected to concentrate more people, buildings, infrastructure and other assets in vulnerable regions"". ‚ÄúSo, the developing world is expected to see more GDP exposed to flood risks in 2030, driven largely by socio-economic change,"" the analysis added.

For instance, India faces more potential change in exposed GDP than any other country. As per the study estimates, India‚Äôs current $14 billion in GDP exposed annually could increase more than 10-fold to $154 billion in 2030 and approximately 60% of that increase could be caused by socio-economic development.

Among the developed nations, Australia, Croatia, Finland, Portugal, and Israel are expected to see more GDP exposed to floods in 2030, driven primarily by social-economic change.

‚ÄúOn the contrary, countries like the Netherlands, Slovenia, Belgium, Ireland, and Switzerland will likely see increased GDP exposure driven primarily by climate change,"" the analysis explained.

Meanwhile, the study also said that climate change will expose more people to river floods than socio-economic development because both the ‚Äúfrequency and intensity of river floods is expected to increase due to climate change in many areas"".

Climate change would expand flood-prone areas and make floods more likely to occur in those areas more often, explained the study while adding that climate change would threaten population in the developed and developing world alike.

In Ireland, for instance, 2,000 people face flood risks currently but by 2030, 48,500 more people could face river flood risk, and 87% of that difference would be driven by climate change.

Among developing nations, around 715,000 people in Pakistan are at risk today but by 2030, river floods could affect two million more, with climate change driving 70% of that increase.

WRI said that sharing of their tool‚Äôs easily accessible data with public and private sector decision makers will immediately raise their awareness about current and future river-flood risks and thus armed with the right information, public and private sector decision makers can prioritize risk reduction and launch climate adaptation projects to prevent catastrophic damage to people and infrastructure.

If Dreher were in flood-hit Chennai last week, he would surely have expanded his list to include the celebrities and common citizens who hit the ground running. But would that complete the list?

What happens after the fires have been put out, lives saved and the last news report filed? What happens after the last citizen and celebrity leave? Who takes the disaster zone back to looking as good as new? Who wipes out the bloodstains? Who scrapes up the rotting flesh?

After front page odes to the heroes of the floods, many local newspapers in Chennai carried a small report inside on December 7 announcing that more than 2,000 sanitation workers from across Tamil Nadu had arrived in the city to clean up the mess. They had to be called in because most of Chennai‚Äôs sanitation workers hadn‚Äôt turned up to work. Most of the slums they live in are also under the dirty water.

But even if they all had turned up for work, the clean-up wouldn‚Äôt be easy; all of Chennai is today one large, festering, open air toilet.

Dalits suffered more than others in flood-hit Cuddalore: Report

The city has around 7,000 sanitation workers, according to R Anbuvedan, state president of the Republican Trade Union of India, which was started by BR Ambdekar. ‚ÄúThe population of Chennai is 85 lakh, meaning one sanitation worker is cleaning the waste generated by around 1,200 people. The central government norms say that there should be three sanitary workers per thousand people,‚Äù says Anbuvelan who is also a member of the corporation‚Äôs manpower reorganisning committee.

According to the city corporation, each person in the city generates 700 grams of waste per day. Chennai generates the highest per capita garbage in the country. That‚Äôs 870 kilos of garbage per sanitary worker per day. But that‚Äôs on good, floodless days.

An NGO‚Äôs worker cuts the hair of a child at a relief camp in Chennai on Thursday. The city suffered its worst flooding in over a century. (PTI)

It is strange that Dreher doesn‚Äôt add sanitation workers to his list of American heroes. It could only be because sanitation workers don‚Äôt exactly ‚Äòrun‚Äô dramatically towards a disaster zone. It surely can‚Äôt be because Dreher doesn‚Äôt consider their work disaster management. Because every morning--with trashcans and sewers full of putrefying human, animal and chemical waste--every city in the world is a potential disaster zone. And what we conventionally consider disaster zones must also be cleaned up.

The US department of labour says that sanitation work is among the 10 most dangerous jobs in that country. The department‚Äôs report says that sanitary workers--a majority of whom are Black or people of colour--are four times more likely to die of work-related hazards than firemen or cops. And journalism did not make it to the top 10.

Under Indian law, a sanitation worker must be given gloves, masks, gumboots, towels, soap and oil. ‚ÄúIf a sanitation worker is not given proper protecive equipment, it constitutes a crime according to the Prohibition of Manual Scavenging Act. The act says that if they are not given protective gear, their work will amount to manual scavenging,‚Äù Anbuvedan says.

Reporting under shadow of defamation gun in flood-ravaged Chennai

As many as 78 men from the Dindigul municipalty are camping in a mariage hall in Gajalakshmi colony of Chennai. They were provided with only seven gumboots. None of them have been given gloves, masks, soap or oil.

These luxuries haven‚Äôt been granted to local sanitary workers either. ‚ÄúI was given gloves and chappals (not gumboots) but they don‚Äôt fit properly. It is not easy to work with ill fitting equipment,‚Äù says Kannamma, 50, a sanitary worker with the Chennai corporation. She confirms that she has cleaned human excrement with her bare hands and says, ‚ÄúToilets everywhere are flooded. Half of the city is defecating in the open. And there are the dead animals.‚Äù

At the north zonal headquarters of the Chennai corporation a sanitary supervisor proudly boasts that the workers have been provided with footwear, gloves and masks. When she is persuaded to show the equipment, it turns out the gloves are made of cloth, the footwear is rubber slippers and the masks are made of a kind of sheer material. All the cops and firemen though have been given nicely fitting gumboots that stand out because of their bright yellow soles.

Only around 700 of the 7,000 sanitary workers in the city are permanent employees of the corporation and get above Rs 15,000 per month. The rest are on contract and are paid anywhere between Rs 200 and Rs 290 as daily wages. No work means no pay. There are no sick leaves. ‚ÄúThe corporation hasn‚Äôt hired permanent sanitary staff for 15 years. There is a severe manpower shortage,‚Äù says Anbuvedan.

Kannamma, whose house in the Ezhil Nagar slum is under waist-deep water, is back at work. She has been a permanent employee of the city corporation for the last eight years and is entitled to all the leaves that other government servants get. ‚ÄúNobody has told me how many leaves I can take. I don‚Äôt understand these things because I am not educated. I have come to work because I don‚Äôt want my salary cut,‚Äù she says.

Here is another well known fact: all of Chennai‚Äôs and indeed all of Tamil Nadu‚Äôs sanitation workers are either Dalits or Adivasis. Most of them are from the Arundhadiyar Scheduled Caste.

‚ÄúEverybody in Chennai has suffered equally because of the floods. But only my people will go through the extra suffering of cleaning Chennai‚Äôs rotting s**t. Why can‚Äôt the concerned citizens and celebrities who are distributing food and blankets also clean up the city? Why is the media only projecting them as heroes?‚Äù asks Ravichandran Bathran, a postdoctoral fellow at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study who is also from the Arundhadiyar community.

‚ÄúEverybody complains of resevations in higher institutions but nobody talks about reservations in the lower institutions. In the business of cleaning s**t, there is 100% reservation for Dalits. Why don‚Äôt people from other castes join this work?‚Äù says Ravichandran.

To be fair, a handful of the citizens‚Äô groups have picked up the broom. The Jamat-e-Islami Hind made headlines when they cleaned Hindu temples. The residents of Choolaimedu cleaned up their own trash and proudly put up photos on Facebook that were shared 10,000 times at last count. And one Tamil actor is planning to organise a team of citizens who will get down to cleaning. They are waiting for protective gear to arrive.

‚ÄúThey will clean the streets but will they clean the gutters? Will they get into manholes that are clogged with rubbish? Even if they do, they will surely wear all the protective equipment,‚Äù says A Narayanan, director of Change India, an NGO that works for the eradication of manual scavenging.

The first signs of an epidemic are already here. Doctors in many government hospitals in the city are confirming cases of rat fever, jaundice and mosquito-borne diseases. While there are bound to be glorious exceptions, as a rule, it will be a silent army of people, mostly belonging to one lowered caste, that will fight this danger with their bare hands.

The sanitary workers are now working in those parts of the city that have not been heavily inundated by the floods. They are waiting for the waters to subside in the worst affected areas. It may be weeks before the water recedes. By then the trash would have decomposed some more. By then most of the cops, firemen and reporters might be back to their regular beats.

In a letter to Modi, she said: ‚ÄúMany parts of the state have been severely affected due to flooding. (A total of) 169 lives were lost during this northeast monsoon since October 1, and there was widespread damage to property including dwelling units and crops.

‚ÄúThe requirement of funds for immediate rescue and relief and the temporary and permanent restoration of infrastructure has been worked out at Rs 8,481 crores in all.‚Äù

Modi also agreed to the Tamil Nadu CM‚Äôs demand for a central team to be dispatched to the state to assess the damage and release aid. More funds would be given to the state after the team submits its report, television channel NDTV quoted a government source as saying.

The chief minister sought the assistance from the National Disaster Response Fund and other central funds.

Requesting Modi to depute a central team to make its on-the-spot assessment, Jayalalithaa had urged him to release Rs 2,000 crore towards relief and restoration operations right away.

According to Jayalalithaa, infrastructure, including roads and bridges, storm water drains, water supply, sewage and electricity supply systems had been battered in many areas.

‚ÄúA deep depression of high intensity formed in the Bay of Bengal and hit the Tamil Nadu coast near Marakkanam, causing extremely heavy rains particularly in the four northern coastal districts of Cuddalore, Kancheepuram, Chennai and Tiruvallur,‚Äù she said.

According to her, based on the forecast received from the Indian Meteorological Department and the alerts received from the National Disaster Management Agency, adequate precautionary measures were taken which minimised loss to life and property.

‚ÄúMore than 4 lakh people were shifted to relief camps and provided food and shelter. Rescue and relief operations were undertaken on a war footing,‚Äù Jayalalithaa told Modi.

From claiming Rs 194 for half a litre of milk to supplying diesel to two-wheelers, claiming more than Rs 7,000 per day for hotel stay, paying relief twice to same people, purchasing 1,800 rain coats from same shop for three days to making payment of Rs 98 lakh towards fuel purchase to a helicopter company, a string of financial bunglings have come to light through responses to RTI queries.

Taking cognizance of these alleged irregularities when Uttarakhand was reeling under one of the worst natural disasters, state Information Commissioner Anil Sharma has suggested a CBI probe.

In a 12-page order, passed after hearing complainant Bhupendra Kumar of National Action Forum for Social Justice, Sharma has taken note of bills provided by various districts in response to RTI queries seeking to know details of funds spent on relief work in the aftermath of the tragedy that claimed 3000 lives, with many still missing.

Records provided by the authorities showed that some of the relief works began on December 28, 2013 and got over on November 16, 2013, full 43 days before having been launched.

Some other works were shown to have started in Pithoragarh on January 22, 2013, six months before the tragedy struck on June 16, 2013.

""From the records produced by the appellant, the Commission prima facie believes that appeal of the complainant along with all the annexure be sent to Chief Secretary, Uttarakhand, with the direction that it should be brought to the notice of the Chief Minister so that he can decide on initiating a CBI inquiry into these allegations,"" Sharma said in the order.

Citing over 200 pages of records received from authorities

in response to his RTI petitions, Kumar claimed during the hearing at SIC that while people starved without a roof on their head, officials in worst-affected Rudraprayag district claimed Rs 250 for breakfast, Rs 300 for lunch and Rs 350 for dinner, totalling Rs 900 per day, apart from hotel stay that cost Rs 6750 per night.

Kumar alleged that total expenditure per officer per day hovered around 7000 as he questioned the ""obscene expenses"".

He claimed the records showed diesel bills of 30 litres and 15 litres for vehicles bearing registration numbers of scooters, motorcycles and three-wheelers. ""These vehicles run on petrol and do not have such fuel tank capacity as shown in the bills,"" he said during the hearing.

Kumar also provided records to show that Rs 98 lakh worth of fuel bills for four days had been cleared for a helicopter company.

The incessant rains and floods that paralysed normal life in Chennai, Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur and Cuddalore districts affected the tourist flow to Kanyakumari since the beginning of the northeast monsoon.

Kanyakumari, an important destination for tourists, usually attracts thousands of tourists, especially Ayyappa devotees, every day from the middle of November to January end.

However, this year the number of tourists visiting the place has considerably come down due to incessant rain, cancellation of trains and buses from different destinations, said S. Venkatachalapathy, Tourism Officer (in-charge), Kanyakumari, on Sunday.

‚ÄúThe daily tourist inflow would be hovering around 10,000 during Sabarimalai season, however, this time it was almost halved due to the flood havoc in Chennai and the three other northern districts, and various other factors such as cancellation of train and bus services to Kanyakumari from various destinations, including New Delhi,‚Äù said Mr. Venkachalapathy.

With the sudden drop in the number of tourists, the transport corporations of Karnataka and Kerala considerably reduced their services, resulting in crowding of available buses.

P. Thambi Thangam, president of Gandhiji Shop Owners Association, said that those having permanent shops were not affected much. However, the sales of over 450 seasonal hawkers had been partially affected. .

Seasonal hawkers were given permission by Kanyakumari Selection Grade Town Panchayat every year, said Mr. Thambi Thangam, who is also vice-president of the local body.

The number of persons who used the ferry services to visit Vivekanandar Memorial Rock and Thiruvalluvar Statue had also reduced by over 25 per cent since the onset of the monsoon, said M. Kingsley Roy, Manager (in-charge), Poompuhar Shipping Corporation, which operates the ferry services.

The heaviest rainfall recorded in a century wreaked havoc in Chennai, where the city‚Äôs natural drainage system has been impaired by unrestrained construction along river banks and wetlands.

Experts said problems of poor urban planning and rampant development are not unique to Chennai, and are a warning to other cities.

On December 1, Chennai recorded 345 millimeters (13.5 inches) of rain in a 24-hour period.

Prasanth Elango, 22, was fast asleep when water gushed into his ground-floor apartment. ""It was full of rubbish and sewage, and three to four dead bodies also came in my friend‚Äôs area. ... The water was coming from all the streets,‚Äù he said.

Lakes, wetlands filled

With such rainfall, experts said they are not surprised that India‚Äôs fourth-largest city turned into a series of islands.

Over the past 15 years, dozens of wetlands and lakes have been filled to build malls, residential areas and business parks in Chennai, a thriving industrial hub and information technology center that is home to more than 6 million people.

Nityanand Jayaraman, a Chennai-based social activist and writer, points out that one of the worst affected areas is Velachery, a thriving residential area that mushroomed on what was once a large lake area after the city‚Äôs technology industry boom.

‚ÄúBetween 2005 and 2015, this place has a mass rapid transit system, a railway station that has been constructed upon the marshland,"" Jayaraman said. ""There has been a vast profusion of buildings that have sprouted up over there to accommodate software workers in gated communities, and now we find that most of these things are under water, and most of the software workers have gone back home.""

He said the area did not suffer the same fate during heavy rains in 2005 because it was not as thickly populated.

Chennai is not the only city brought to its knees by a heavy deluge.

Ten years ago, the financial hub of Mumbai faced a similar catastrophe after being lashed by 944 millimeters (37 inches) of rain. Last year, Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir in the Himalayan mountains, found itself under meters (feet) of water after being deluged by heavy rains.

Unregulated construction

In both cases, urban planners pointed at silting, unregulated construction, and encroachments along lakes and water bodies, which pushed the water into city neighborhoods.

City planners warn that much of the urbanization of India is happening on areas not suitable for construction, such as in flood plains.

Kapil Gupta of the Indian Institute of Technology Mumbai convened India‚Äôs first panel on urban flooding, which was set up in the wake of the Mumbai floods.

‚ÄúThere has been unplanned construction and the drainage of these areas has not been planned. Our urban centers need to be protected. We are spending so much on infrastructure, but we need to spend on drainage also and, obviously, we need to leave sufficient path for the rainfall so that our activities are not paralyzed,‚Äù Gupta said.

Urban planners are ringing alarm bells as climate experts warn that global warming is likely to result in more extreme weather.

India‚Äôs mega cities are already home to millions of people. By 2050, 1 billion people are expected to live in urban areas.

This high-density population would put millions at risk when cities are devastated by flooding.

The Chennai floods have taken a heavy toll -- more than 280 people have died since November and industries have pegged losses at over $20 billion.

Drainage issue

Despite those figures, Shashidhar Reddy, former vice chairman of India‚Äôs National Disaster Management Authority, said stormwater drainage remains a low priority for city officials.

""Unlike the roads, which are getting widened to accommodate more traffic, the capacities of the drains have diminished because of encroachments, because of silting, and that is true to every city in India,"" Reddy said.

He said, on average, the capacity of stormwater drains need to be more than doubled.

After facing colossal losses, Chennai residents are taking action.

But are we certain that we would be safer, better protected and more informed if the city were to again receive rainfall as it did on that fateful day in July 2005, a record 944mm in 24 hours? Going by the status update we receive from the government and media every July, it appears that Mumbai could be rendered just as helpless and unsafe as it was then. Has Srinagar learned its lessons, will Chennai learn? As long as urban floods are defined as these once-in-a-century events, the lessons will be missed.

The extremely intense floods such as Mumbai 2005 and Chennai this year may be unusual phenomena brought on by a rare combination of meteorological, hydrological and human factors, but urban flooding is more common than we realise it to be. Indeed, repeated incidences of urban floods in the last decade are as follows: Mumbai (nine times), Chennai (six times), Hyderabad (five times), Ahmedabad (seven times), Kolkata (five times), Bengaluru (four times) and Surat (thrice). This does not include Delhi, Srinagar and other metros, which have experienced floods fewer times.

That urban flooding is significantly different from rural flooding, calls for an altered flood management approach, and its management must be dovetailed into urban planning itself were recognised five years ago in the exhaustive guidelines developed, after years of consultations with multiple central and state agencies, by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). It reaffirmed the causes of urban flooding: Rampant land-use changes, unregulated construction without accounting for natural water flows (such as the airports in Mumbai and Chennai), encroachments, sealing off natural drainage systems such as rivers and lakes, ageing storm water drains, improper waste disposal, and ineffective warning and information systems.

The guidelines have remained on paper. The separate nodal unit that the NDMA had recommended to be set up within the Ministry of Urban Development to deal with urban floods is not yet a reality. While the ministry goes about making smart cities with a ferocious energy, it misses or overlooks the need to account for urban flooding in a methodical manner, and get states and urban planning agencies excited about it.

The relationship between urban flooding and human encroachments on natural eco-systems is now too obvious. Mumbai has nearly 60% more built-up land today than it did 90 years ago, its river systems are seen more clearly on a map than in reality, and its lakes are smaller than ever. The story of urban development is similar in Srinagar, Chennai, Hyderabad, Guwahati and other cities that witnessed frequent urban floods in the last decade.

To continue to rapidly urbanise and expand our cities without factoring in urban flooding now would be a foolish thing to do indeed. With climate change phenomenon making urban floods the new normal, urban development plans would have to include ways to prevent such floods as well as create flood management systems. There is little evidence of this in Mumbai‚Äôs planning. The 2005 flood is treated as a one-off episode. Nothing could be more disastrous.

delhi,2015,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/8-year-old-gets-bravery-award-for-rescuing-brother/,16-Aug-15,8-year-old gets bravery award for rescuing brother,"Eight-year-old Mahika could not figure out what was happening around her, but she was certain of one thing ‚Äî she had to save her brother from the deluge surrounding them. On June 15, 2013, her family was praying at the Gaurikund Temple near Kedarnath when they got caught in the Uttarakhand floods.

Separated from her mother, she single-handedly ensured her brother made it to safety.

For her actions, Mahika was presented with the bravery award by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday. But it is not her first. She was among the 25 children who received the President‚Äôs National Bravery Award on January 24, 2014. She was conferred the highest honour ‚Äî the Bharat Award.

Mahika and her brother Dhairya were travelling with their mother to Kedarnath as part of a 16-member group while their father stayed behind in Delhi. Recounting the incident, Mahika‚Äôs mother Renu Gupta said, ‚ÄúWe did not even have time to think. I have no idea how and when I was separated from my family. The next thing I knew, I was floating in the river.‚Äù

The now 10-year-old remembers the day more clearly than her mother. ‚ÄúWe were sitting on the floor of the temple when the water suddenly rushed towards us. The building began to shake. I couldn‚Äôt find my mother but I saw my brother screaming,‚Äù she said.

Mahika, who is four years older than her brother, put one arm across his stomach and another on his face to stop water from entering his mouth. ‚ÄúI did not know how to swim. We kept floating for at least two hours in the water,‚Äù she recalled. She had never heard of a ‚Äúflood‚Äù and did not know what it meant.

While she kept floating with the debris, someone called out to her and pointed out a hotel window in her path. Holding onto her brother, Mahika managed to pull herself towards the window. People caught hold of the children. ‚ÄúThey cleaned us up because were floating in muddy water and gave us some clean water and food,‚Äù she said.

All this while, Renu, who was unconscious, kept floating. ‚ÄúWhen I regained consciousness, I found myself caught between iron rods. I gathered all my strength and got out of the water. I then followed people walking in one direction,‚Äù she said.

A day and a half later, Mahika found her mother walking towards the building she was in.

delhi,2015,https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/j-k-flood-victims-caught-in-govt-ngo-politics-115030700773_1.html,07-Mar-15,J&K flood victims caught in govt-NGO politics,"Late last year, Caritas India, a venerable and respected voluntary organisation that has responded with alacrity to one Indian humanitarian crisis after another, sent out an appeal through its international network for funds for contributions to relief and rehabilitation work in Jammu and Kashmir, where devastating floods and landslides in September had claimed 282 lives and damaged 2.53 lakh houses, according to official figures.Among those that responded was the Netherlands-based Dutch Catholic Organisation for Relief and Development (Cordaid), pledging 220,000 euros (approximately 1.54 crore). However, when the first instalment of 100,000 euros reached Caritas India's bank account in November-end, the NGO was informed by its bank that the money could not be credited.This came as a surprise. Even though Cordaid has been on a government watch-list for about three years for allegedly aiding activists protesting against oil drilling in the Northeast, and finds critical mention in an Intelligence Bureau (IB) report on NGOs leaked last year, it has been able to contribute to Caritas India's projects across a series of humanitarian crises. According to Caritas' officials, the most recent include the Assam floods in 2012, and the Uttarakhand floods and the Odisha cyclone in 2013.As the winter grew harsher in Kashmir, Caritas officials made visits in December and January to the home ministry wing that implements the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010 (FCRA), and explained that the funds were critically required for a project, to be completed in March, that involved building low cost housing. To date, they have not been able to get the money, but are instead grappling with a 32-point questionnaire sent by the FCRA wing that requires the organisation, which has been meticulous in submitting its accounts, and displays its annual report on its website, to submit nothing short of a complete financial history. The questionnaire asks, among other things, for details, and utilisation, of foreign contributions received by Caritas India, which is more than 50 years old, from inception.""It is a mind-boggling, and unnecessary form,"" says Father Frederick D'Souza, executive director of Caritas India. ""This is not correct. The people for whom the money was meant are the ones affected.""While the recent deplaning of a Greenpeace activist has hit the headlines, less visible, but also eloquent of the government's hardening stances, is the impeding of funds for humanitarian relief, or other similarly non-controversial purposes, when they come from international organisations to which it is inimical.""While the government may have its problems with certain donors, blocking or delaying money coming in for humanitarian work is wrong,"" says Manu Gupta, director of SEEDS, which carries out post-disaster reconstruction and relief. ""There are no controversies here, the purpose is clear and simple, and the work is time-sensitive. If you don't reach out to the affected people fast, they will either die or spiral downwards into an even lower state of helplessness.""Gupta said SEEDS could not access remittances sent by Cordaid after the Uttarakhand floods in 2013, and after the J&K floods in 2014. The first time, SEEDS tried liaising with both the FCRA wing and its bank, but to no avail. Last year, it waited for its bank to carry out the due diligence, in consultation with the ministry, and report back, on the 50,000 euros (Rs 35 lakh) sent by Cordaid, which it had planned to use as part of its efforts to build fully equipped tents for the J&K flood victims, but there was no response.Church's Auxiliary for Social Action (CASA), a voluntary organisation with a stellar record for humanitarian work, also said recently, for the first time, it was not able to receive remittances from two donors (other than Cordaid), on the government's watch-list. While declining to name the donors, CASA's director, Sushant Agrawal, said in one case, instalments of money for flood relief in Odisha sent before December last year were received, but a small, later installment has been impeded. In another recent case, 50,000 euros sent for a child labour project has been held up.The practice of instructing banks, via the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to credit funds from donors on a government watchlist only after clearances from the home ministry was instituted by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. However, judging by what some donors and recipients told Business Standard, this is now being implemented much more stringently.Ingrid Srinath, who runs the India office of the Netherlands- based Hivos, which is also on the government's watch-list, said: ""The policies are a continuation of the UPA government's but what has changed is the level of emboldenment among those implementing them, and sense of fear among those who could help you."" She said lawyers, bankers and professionals are increasingly wary of engaging with Hivos on these matters.Theoretically, money remitted by watch-listed donors is meant to be released after due diligence but, say those affected, the process is shrouded in secrecy and beset with confusion, making the outcome uncertain. Circulars sent out by the RBI to the banks, notifying them of donors on a ""prior permission"" list ( i.e, those for whom clearances are required) are marked ""Secret"". (The most recent one, dated January 15, listing 10 international donors for whom prior permission was needed, got wide currency only because the RBI first put it on its website and then hastily withdrew it, but not before many NGOs had downloaded it.) Thus, when affected organisations try to chase up the matter with the FCRA wing, they are told this is for the bank to sort out. ""At no point will the ministry even acknowledge that such a list exists,"" says Srinath. Banks, for their part, are often not clear on how to take the matter forward, say recipients. Gupta said his bank initially asked him to sort out the matter with the home ministry, ""but there was no procedure for us to do that."" ""There is no clarity on who exactly must seek prior permission,"" says Agrawal.What a recipient is likely to get, in course of time, is the dreaded 32-point questionnaire from FCRA, followed by visits from local IB officials, but even these may not bring closure. A representative of an NGO told Business Standard, confidentially, that even after the submission of the questionnaire and multiple IB visits, the matter of a blocked remittance from Hivos has not been resolved in several months.A representative of a donor agency who did not want to be identified, said, ""This is not merely bureaucratic delay, it is purposeful delay.""",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Weather forecast shows no possibilities of heavy rains, however, for the next three days the city and coastal districts will receive rain.

On Saturday, thrice during the day the city witnessed heavy rain, while the dark clouds continue to threat the residents. All the key services, including power, milk supply, mobile connections, trains and flights are expected to be restored in the next two or three days.

Meanwhile, rescue operations by defence including Army, Navy, Airforce and others are being undertaken day and night to rescue people from many parts of the city and from suburbans. They were joined by hundreds of young volunteers.

Meanwhile, ruling AIADMK has said it would initiate action against partymen blocking volunteers‚Äô relief materials from reaching the rain-and flood-affected people and forcing volunteers to paste pictures of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on relief material.

They were responding to reports that the party-men in many places are forcing to paste AIADMK's Supermo picture.

On the otherside hundreds of people are stuck in places like Velacherry, Pozhichallur in many places at OMR, where all the IT majors have offices, many suburban areas on GST road which connect Southern districts are continuing to pray for rescue team to reach out to them.

They continue to send messages to different groups and in social media pleading for help. An IT engineer posted saying he is stuck with a seven-month-old kid and his family for three days.

Similarly lots of people have posted saying they have sick and elderly people with them and in need of food and water and also want rescue team to take them out from the places they were stuck.

Helpline numbers either could not be reached or constantly busy. Many could not call as telecommunications in many parts are down.

Food, water, power and other essential products are continue to be in demand and scarcity continues.

Tamil Nadu announced operation of 11 mobile vegetable shops in 32 localities. The state government said owing to the heavy rains vegetable supplies have gone down resulting their prices going up.

According to the statement the mobile shops will be operated in Saidapet, Anna Nagar, T Nagar, Nungambakkam, Teynampet, Mylapore, Kodambakkam, Royapettah, Gopalapuram, Tondaiarpet and others.

State-run AAVIN said measures are being taken to step up milk supply and that it would reach full capacity by Sunday.

Mobile network across the city continues to be bad. Airport and railway stations, except for MRTS and Metroril, are not operational.

ATMs are dry. Reports stated from tonight the mobile connections and ATMs are likely to work till tomorrow morning.

Southern Railway is operating special trains from Chennai to Madurai, Tiruchirappalli, Tiruchendur, Karaikal and Tirunelveli.

Chennai airport is available for limited day time operations for technical ferry and relief flight, said union ministry of civil aviation. The airport was shutdown till December 6th owing to flooding of the runway due to the floods.

Officials are using motors to pump out water from the runway and the airport's runway has become dry.

""We started technical flights from Chennai airport. But we are unable to resume commercial flights as the basement of the airport is still waterlogged and power supply of the terminal building has not been restored completely.""

‚ÄúIt might take at least 2-3 days to clear the airport for operations,‚Äù the Minister of State for Civil Aviation told media at New Delhi.

He said four commercial flights were operated from INS Rajali Naval base. Two flights of Indigo and one each of Spicejet and Trujet evacuated 310 people from there. Meanwhile, three stranded Air India aircraft flew back to Delhi from Chennai airport.

A total 34 aircraft of various airlines were stranded at the airport due to the flooding caused by torrential rains.

Airport director Deepak Shastri said the Directorate General of Civil Aviation had given clearance for day operations for departures alone.

‚ÄúThis is only for clearing the 22 stranded flights, but the terminal is not yet ready,‚Äù he added. It may take quite sometime to resume fullfledged operations, he was quoted in a report.

Bus services both in the city and connecting other parts of the state were restored partially. The state administration has decided not to charge the passengers who are using the services.

People, mainly the migrants, continue to leave from Chennai through whichever mode is possible. As in many parts of the city the water started draining out people have started taking their vehicles to move out from the city, however non-availability of fuel in bunks and cash in ATMs are forcing keeping to stay back.

delhi,2015,https://e360.yale.edu/features/unnatural_disaster_how_global_warming_helped_cause_indias_catastrophic_flood,23-Jun-15,Unnatural Disaster: How Climate Helped Cause India‚Äôs Big Flood,"Two years ago this month, a flood devastated the Himalayan village of Kedarnath, India, the destination of half a million Hindu pilgrims annually. The town sits 11,500 feet up in a tight valley. Sharp, snowy peaks tower on three sides and a stone temple sits at one end. The flood ‚Äî which occurred on June 17, 2013 ‚Äî was India‚Äôs worst disaster in a decade. Several thousand people drowned. The deluge tore apart dozens of bridges, swept away miles of paved roads, and carried off herds of livestock.

Government officials, scientific researchers, and media commentators soon speculated about the cause of the flood and about why so many people had died. They pointed to the early and heavy monsoon rains. They railed against poorly built homes, unregulated development along the Mandakini River that runs through Kedarnath, and soil erosion caused by thousands of pilgrims trekking on foot and on donkeys to reach this remote town in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand.

All these factors contributed. Yet in the two years since the flood, scientists studying with the care and intensity of forensic investigators have added another key cause: global warming. In recent papers, they conclude that melting glaciers and shifting storm tracks may soon set off more catastrophic floods in mountainous regions of India and adjacent countries. Atmospheric scientists say that in northern India the intense rains that preceded the disaster are extremely rare. But they have discovered that an unusual collision of weather systems steered storms over Uttarakhand and locked them in place, pouring rain down for days. Long-term changes in weather patterns are making such collisions more likely, a development that some scientists believe is caused by global warming. Global warming has is also melting glaciers all over the Himalayas, including one perched above Kedarnath. Some researchers say that had the glacier remained healthy, heavy rain alone would not have destabilized a gravel bank that collapsed, releasing a destructive pulse of debris-filled water.

Sitting on the carpet in his father‚Äôs living room, in New Delhi, 200 miles southwest of Kedarnath, Vaibhav Kaul, a young geographer, watched reports of the disaster on TV. He remembers thinking to himself, ‚Äúthat was exactly the kind of scenario I‚Äôd been studying for the year.‚Äù He‚Äôd recently completed a Masters degree in Environmental Change and Management at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. His thesis studied how Himalayan communities could better prepare for catastrophic floods from the lakes above them. He‚Äôd briefly considered making Kedarnath the subject of his research.

A devout Hindu and descended from Kashmiri Pandits ‚Äî an elite caste that has produced many of India‚Äôs ruling class of scholars, administrators and politicians ‚Äî Kaul had made the religious excursion to Kedarnath once before and hiked two hours above the town to Lake Chorabari Tal. But when he later read a report cataloging the Himalayan lakes most likely to flood and endanger communities below, Chorabari Tal was not among those listed as ‚Äúpotentially dangerous.‚Äù He decided to study towns elsewhere in the Himalayas instead. But his instincts proved to be correct.

Four months after the flood, Kaul set off on a scientific pilgrimage to the disaster site, determined to learn why a town considered relatively safe had flooded. He wore a traditional robe, hanging to below his knees, and the sort of dark wool vest favored by men in Kashmir, the mountainous region of his ancestors.

The flood had severed the eight-mile footpath to Kedarnath from the rest of India. Kaul took a bus to Guptkashi, the closest town with public transport, but nearly 25 miles short of Kedarnath. He continued on foot, astonished at the scale of destruction even so far downstream. The flood had passed through Kedarnath and surged down the Mandakini, joined by swollen tributaries, gathering force and debris. Kaul saw bare abutments where bridges had stood and foundationless houses dangling above landslide scars. Thirty hydroelectric plants had been damaged or destroyed.

‚ÄòOne couldn‚Äôt imagine that there‚Äôd been anything there,‚Äô Kaul said of a settlement that was totally destroyed by the flood.

About four miles shy of Kedarnath, he came to the former site of Rambara, a way station that once had about 100 seasonal shopping stalls and several small hotels. Pilgrims had rested there over sweet, milky tea and fried flatbreads and bought camping supplies and religious trinkets. Kaul saw only an empty shelf of bedrock strewn with boulders. ‚ÄúOne couldn‚Äôt imagine there‚Äôd been anything there,‚Äù he said later.

Some of of Kedarnath‚Äôs steel-reinforced concrete guesthouses and stuccoed fieldstone homes survived better. Still, nearly three quarters of its 259 buildings had been damaged. More than half had been battered and washed away. The flood took most of its victims in Kedarnath, the season‚Äôs first pilgrims. ‚ÄúThey were still finding dead people,‚Äù Kaul recalled, noting that he had smelled rotting flesh and watched relief workers excavate a severed leg.

Kaul climbed steep hills to an overlook about 2,000 feet above the town. The top of a hulking mountain, nearly 23,000 feet tall and crowned by Chorabari glacier, appeared. It blocked the sky at the head of the valley. At an inflection point, where the slope leveled off, a vast tongue of ice stretched out for a mile. Kaul looked for Chorabari Tal. It should have been visible below him, near the tongue‚Äôs tip. But there was no lake to be seen.

Titanic geologic forces had forged Chorabari Tal during the widespread cold spell that lasted from about 1300 to 1870 and is known as the Little Ice Age. The glacier had bulldozed stone into linear piles ‚Äî moraines ‚Äî jammed between the advancing tongue and the valley‚Äôs bedrock rim. The ice had then receded, leaving the lake‚Äôs lens-shaped basin, a depression with no outlet. Rain and melted snow filled it every spring and summer. At times, water drained out through the porous moraine, and the water level dropped.

Now, as Kaul looked down, he saw that the basin was empty. He knew what had occurred: The moraine had ruptured, letting loose the lake‚Äôs entire contents in a catastrophic spasm.

Kaul surveyed the town sprawling in the valley below him. It was built on a bed of gravel shaped like the prow of a ship sailing toward the glacier. Metal roofs sparkled. Unscathed by the flood, the Kedarnath Hindu temple stood at the narrow end of town.

Researchers suspect two factors: the unusually heavy rainfall, and the degraded condition of Chorabari Glacier.

The shrine, stately, gabled and thick-walled, was built of huge stacked stone blocks. Priests probably constructed it in the 8th or 9th century, on the site of an even older temple, and dedicated it to the Hindu god Lord Shiva the Destroyer.



From his overlook, Kaul saw the boulder that had saved the temple from destruction. Miraculously, the deluge had scooped up this 30-foot-long rock and dropped it, perpendicular to the current, just steps short of the temple, where it had deflected the churning waters around the historic building.

Kaul snapped a set of pictures. A few weeks later, British geographer Dave Petley, at the University of East Anglia, published some of Kaul‚Äôs photos on a blog widely read by landslide researchers. These photos proved what Petley and other scientists had suspected from blurry satellite images released by India‚Äôs space agency. They showed a V-shaped cut in the natural dike that had dammed Chorabari Tal for centuries. An 18-wheeler could fit through the break in the gravel wall.

Using Kaul‚Äôs photos, Petley explained in blog posts the chain of events implied by the breached embankment in the days before the flood. The lake probably had swelled to capacity during the heavy rain and accompanying snowmelt. The weight of all that water could have punched through the dike. When the wall broke apart, an immense wave loaded with boulders raced a mile downhill straight for Kedarnath.

Terrified pilgrims and inhabitants had huddled inside any shelter they found. Survivors describe hearing a tremendous boom. The torrent poured into the Mandakini River, already raging above the town with the downpours and snowmelt. Chandi Prasad Tiwari, a shopkeeper, saw a wave crest over a three-story building. ‚ÄúGod, please help us, please help us,‚Äù he recalls sobbing. He felt sure he‚Äôd die.

The Chorabari Tal‚Äôs basin is not huge. ‚ÄúJust a puddle,‚Äù Kaul says. But it probably released its entire contents, about 100 million gallons, in a quarter of an hour, say scientists at the University of Calcutta. The team estimated that for several minutes the torrent pounded Kedarnath with half the flow of Niagara Falls.

If Chorabari Tal‚Äôs 100 million gallons were the explosive blow that hit Kedarnath and its occupants, what set it in motion? Why did the lake basin, intact for hundreds of years, burst now? Researchers have spent the two years since the catastrophe trying to find out. They suspect two factors: the unusually heavy rainfall, and the degraded condition of Chorabari Glacier.

Several recent resarch papers say that global warming may have set up the town of Kedarnath for the disaster.

Monsoon rain poured torrentially throughout India the week prior to the flood. Twice as much rain fell in the first two weeks of June, 2013 as had fallen in the same fortnight in any of the prior 60 years. It fell with ferocity in the mountains of Uttarakhand. Just before the storm washed it away on June 16, a rain gauge at Chorabari Tal set up by Indian researchers recorded 13 inches of rainfall in a 24-hour period. Despite scant long-term weather records for the region, studies show that such a downpour was rare, and perhaps unprecedented. One research paper calculated that an equally wet month probably occurs less often than once a century.

Indian researchers attribute the abrupt, intense rainstorms that sometimes drench Himalayan states to a type of weather system called a Western Disturbance, in which moisture travels to India on high altitude winds from the Mediterranean Sea, over the Arabian Peninsula, past Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. There the wet wind hits the Himalayas and drops its moisture, showering northern India several times a month during the winter. Western Disturbance storms are less common after mid-spring. Then, the summer monsoon begins, bearing moisture from the Bay of Bengal and spreading north and west from near Kolkata on India‚Äôs eastern coast.

About half a million Hindu pilgrims visit Kedarnath every year, most arriving on foot. DANIEL GROSSMAN

In an interview at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, A. P. Dimri, a specialist in Himalayan weather patterns, says that a freak collision of a Western Disturbance and the summer monsoon combined in the extreme rains of June, 2013 (see this paper he coauthored). The monsoon struck southeastern India as usual, in the second week of the month. But clouds raced north and west with extraordinary speed. The rain arrived in Uttrakhand two weeks ahead of schedule, crashing into that Western Disturbance. Dimri says the two opposing systems of moisture-laden air ‚Äúsmushed together,‚Äù into a Frankenstorm that stayed pinned for two days to the southern flank of the Himalayas. Some researchers say similar conditions may have loosed floods that killed 3,000 people in Pakistan and northern India in the summer of 2010.

Several recent research papers say that global warming may have set up Kednarath for the disaster, by transforming regional weather patterns and eroding Chorabari Glacier. Western Disturbance storms are becoming more frequent and lasting longer. The monsoon is launching its march across India earlier and traveling faster. Dimri says that global warming may be responsible for this transformation of India‚Äôs weather.

In a 2014 paper, scientists at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology conclude that rapid heating of the high-altitude Tibetan Plateau north of the Himalayas, caused by global warming, is rerouting Western Disturbance storms. The Tibetan Plateau has heated up faster than nearby lowlands. When patterns of heat over Earth‚Äôs surfaces changes, so do the winds they drive.

A team led by researchers at Stanford University has the studied whether global warming made Uttrakhand‚Äôs drenching month of June 2013 more likely. Using 11 leading computer models, they compared simulations of June rain with and without the last 150 years of burning coal and oil and natural gas. They published their results in a special extreme weather issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. The paper‚Äôs lead author, Deepti Singh, a Stanford graduate student, says that of the three models that they trusted most, two showed that the June event was ‚Äúmore likely than it would have been,‚Äù had humans not heated the planet.

Though changes in India‚Äôs weather are undeniable, it‚Äôs hard to prove conclusively that global warming caused them.

Dimri says that though changes in India‚Äôs weather are undeniable, it‚Äôs hard prove conclusively that global warming caused them. Weather patterns in the Himalayas are just too complicated. He points to the well-known difficulty of constructing a realistic computer model of the complex and interactive monsoon. However, a study published earlier this year offers new and more certain, evidence of global warming‚Äôs role in the Kedarnath flood.

According to an in the May 2015 issue of the journal Landslides, the heavy rain and melting snow probably wouldn‚Äôt have breached the lake‚Äôs bank had the tongue of ice that lays alongside the moraine not receded in recent decades. Chorabari Glacier has been retreating rapidly for at least 50 years. It has lost 11 percent of its surface area, and its tongue has contracted by about one-quarter of a mile since 1962. Other nearby glaciers and many glaciers around the world are in even faster retreat. Indian glaciologists say without hesitation that global warming is responsible for Chorabari‚Äôs decline. Simon Allen, a researcher at Zurich University and lead author of the Landslides paper says if buttressed by the bigger, healthier tongue of prior decades, the moraine could have withstood more pressure, Chorabari Tal might have survived the storm, and Kedarnath might have suffered far less destruction.

Chorabari Tal is only one of scores of lakes that may have been destabilized by receding glaciers in the Himalayas, he says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have more of these things.‚Äù

Mamata held the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) responsible for the ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù release of water from their barrages, claiming this resulted in the current situation, causing a huge loss of property and lives, a charge denied by the DVC.

Mamata added that she has sought appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during her visit in Delhi on August 11 and 12 to discuss the situation and demand help from the National Disaster Relief Fund.

She added that she will submit a report to the Prime Minister and raise some crucial issues like modernisation and renovation of reservoirs owned by DVC ‚Äî mostly in Jharkhand. ‚ÄúWest Bengal will no more allow DVC to inundate Bengal. The death toll has gone up to 83,‚Äù she said, adding that she has lodged a complaint with Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal in this

regard.

[related-post]

‚ÄúThe DVC headquarters is located in Bengal. It was doing business from Bengal, but has also inundating the state. It should have taken up modernisation work. Proper dredging could have given DVC the capacity to retain an additional 200,000 cusecs of water and it could have prevented the flooding of Bengal,‚Äù Mamata said.

Responding to Mamata‚Äôs allegations, a DVC spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe are constantly trying to find a suitable agency for dredging, but are yet to identify anyone.‚Äù

On Tuesday as well, DVC released 120,000 cusecs of water. It, however, countered the charge of excess discharge from its barrages, saying the release of water from the DVC system was not the reason for flooding in downstream areas.

‚ÄúThe flooding over the past few days is mainly due to the high tidal effects and Komen depression-related rainfall. The combined release on August 3 was 95,000 cusecs, which is lower than the safe downstream channel carrying capacity of the Damodar river, which is 1,10,000 cusecs,‚Äù DVC said in a release.

The DVC added that in spite of the unprecedented heavy rainfall in Jharkhand and West Bengal, DVC dams at Panchet and Maithon had been able to moderate the flow of water to a significant extent of 68 per cent for the last two days.

Meanwhile, the flood situation in South Bengal improved slightly as a result of no rain, reduced discharge of water from barrages and waning tides. The chief minister said 4.31 lakh people have taken shelter in 2,449 relief camps in the 12 affected districts.

Fourteen more people died, taking the state toll to 83. ‚ÄúAltogether, 2,449 relief camps have been set up to shelter over 4.31 lakh marooned people and 470 medical camps opened,‚Äù a source said, adding that the total number of affected people was over 61 lakh. Sources claimed that 1,07,808 houses were damaged and 3,68,238 houses destroyed partly. Crop over an area of 7,97,848 hectares has been damaged due to the floods.

With no rains and waning tides, the water level has started receding from inundated areas in Burdwan, Hooghly, Howrah, West Midnapore, East Midnapore, South-24 Parganas, North-24 Parganas, Nadia, Murshidabad, Bankura and Birbhum districts, state Irrigation Minister Rajib Banerjee said.

‚ÄúAll BDOs and SDOs have been asked to submit reports as early as possible. The state government wants to disburse relief funds to the people with a notification by August 18,‚Äù said Mamata.

She added that the state finance minister has been asked to speak to banks regarding waiver of agricultural loans. ‚ÄúThe department has been asked to advice if the farmers can take up cultivation of any alternative crop once the water receded.

delhi,2015,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/Cr43StTjvEsFJ44jYt020M/Chennai-floods-A-tragedy-foretold.html,07-Dec-15,Chennai floods: A tragedy foretold,"The tragedy of the recent Chennai floods, which, mercifully, as of Saturday has begun to abate, is that it could have been avoided (another matter that the city displayed tremendous character in dealing with the crisis, just as social media once again showed us that it is a key tool in assisting rescuers and, in some cases, saving the trapped.) In the case of Chennai, there was one key cause: the Adyar river basin has been taken over for the new airport, just as other stretches have been used to develop residential spaces. Denied its natural path, excess water flooded the neighbourhood. Till nature unleashed its excess, planners ignored the risks; and, look what we got.

We have seen this pattern play out earlier in Mumbai and more recently in the devastating floods that gutted Srinagar. And almost in every instance, the central cause is easy to ascertain: unplanned urbanization inspired by an utter disregard for basic norms. Yet, every time the import of the tragedy fades along with public memory. Like in Chennai, a disaster is waiting to happen in Delhi, with authorities, in their wisdom, allowing some of the flood plains to accommodate the swanky Commonwealth Games village.

It is this business-as-usual approach that is worrying. This struck home with the passing of another dubious milestone last week: The 31st anniversary of the Bhopal gas tragedy‚ÄîIndia‚Äôs worst industrial disaster. It passed by almost unnoticed (unlike its 30th anniversary). The tragedy, as in the case of Chennai, is that there is no evidence that any lessons have been learnt, leave alone the fact that the inadequately compensated people affected by the tragedy are still dealing with the deadly consequences of the methyl isocyanate gas leak.

It is not just the frequency of disasters‚Äîwhich is alarmingly on the rise‚Äîit is that the country is particularly risk-prone. Due to a combination of topography and high population density, India is particularly vulnerable to disasters, and the authorities are well aware of it. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the apex body for disaster management, provides us a risk profile on its website:

* More than 58.6% of the landmass is prone to earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity

* More than 40 million hectares (12%) of its land is prone to floods and river erosion

* Close to 5,700km, out of the 7,516km long coastline, is prone to cyclones and tsunamis

* 68% of its cultivable area is vulnerable to droughts (several states, particularly in central and north India, are suffering the ravages of back-to-back droughts in the past two years)

* Its hilly areas are at risk from landslides and avalanches (as the flash floods in Leh and Ladakh underlined in 2010).

The NDMA‚Äôs website has this humbling homily to add: ‚ÄúDisaster risks in India are further compounded by increasing vulnerabilities related to changing demographics and socioeconomic conditions, unplanned urbanization, development within high-risk zones, environmental degradation, climate change, geological hazards, epidemics and pandemics.""

And what it says next is what should serve as a wake-up call to all‚Äîgovernments as well as citizens. Clearly, all these ‚Äúcontribute to a situation where disasters seriously threaten India‚Äôs economy, its population and sustainable development"". If this is not enough to drive home the point, then check out a recent report by the World Resources Institute (WRI), which says that India tops the list of 163 nations affected by river floods in terms of the number of people. According to it, every year, the lives of 4.85 million Indians are disrupted by floods, risking $14.3 billion of gross domestic product.

It is apparent then that India is at risk from disasters. It is also obvious that urbanization and high-density population pockets are emerging as the new way of life. Take the two together and there is only one conclusion: without sustainability, India‚Äôs urbanization is a recipe for disaster.

NEW DELHI: Emerging out of the deluge caused by heavy rains, Chennai is finally beginning to find its footing.After complete production shutdown for over a week due to the flood, automotive industry is limping back to normalcy in this Southern automotive hub. Slowly and gradually, the companies are beginning to restart their manufacturing Most of the automakers who have a manufacturing setup in Chennai, had to suspend their manufacturing after Chennai and surrounding areas received incessant rain in the last week of November. This was the second time in a month that companies were forced to bring the shutter down on manufacturing in Chennai.Some of the big names that had to shut down their operations in the state included Hyundai Motor India Royal Enfield , and Renault India While companies have opened up the plant, they are still evaluating the losses incurred during the last week.""Normal operations resumed on December 5, 2015 and production is now in full swing. However, any loss to production can only be assessed by the end of the month,"" said YK Koo , managing director, Hyundai Motor India . ""The road damages due to rains, have caused logistic challenges but we are closely working with vendors and supply chain partners continuously to ensure that supply of parts is not impacted.‚ÄùHyundai had called off the third shift on December 1 and all shifts subsequently from December 2 - 4.

Starting last week, the state has seen an unprecedented amount of rainfall, resulting in its worst floods since 1959. Floods in the state are invariably linked to the Jhelum River and its history of crossing the danger mark, its streams and rivulets overflowing and thereby inundating the ‚ÄúValley"" (south Kashmir) in the process.

While the scale of devastation caused by these floods is nothing short of massive, with over 200 people having lost their lives so far, the Valley, along with the Jammu region has, over time witnessed floods occurring at regular intervals. According to Sir Walter Roper Lawrence in his book, The Valley of Kashmir (1895), ‚ÄúMany disastrous floods are noticed in vernacular histories, but the greatest was the terrible inundation which followed the slipping of the Khadanyar mountains below Baramula in AD 879. The channel of the Jhelum river was blocked and a large part of the valley was submerged.""

The other major flood to affect Kashmir happened in 1841, which Lawrence notes, ‚Äúcaused much damage to life and property."" However, the first flood of devastating proportions to hit the state came half a century later in 1893, when 52 hours of continuous and warm rainfall, beginning 18 July, caused what Lawrence describes as ‚Äúa great calamity"". In 1893, he notes, ‚Äúthe flood cost the state ‚Çπ 64,804 in land revenue alone, 25,426 acres of crops were submerged, 2,225 houses were wrecked and 329 cattle killed."" In the aftermath of the 1893 floods, Lawrence noted an interesting practice, where he wrote, ‚ÄúMarvellous tales were told of the efficacy of the flags of saints which had been set up to arrest the floods, and people believe that the rice fields of Tulamula and the bridge of Sumbal were saved by the presence of these flags, which were taken from the shrines as a last resort"".

The Valley also recorded major floods at the turn of the century, with the most devastating one coming 10 years after the 1893 disaster. The floods, which in the day were classified as the ‚Äúgreatest flood ever known"", came down the Valley and Srinagar on 23 July 1903, converting the city into ‚Äúa whole lake"". According to Saligram Bhatt in his 2004-book Kashmir Ecology and Environment: New Concerns and Strategies, the water level in the 1903 floods were higher by 3 points as compared to the one that had hit the state a decade earlier. Bhatt wrote, ‚Äú7,000 dwellings went down in the neighbourhood of the city, including 773 on the Dal Lake."" For the next quarter of a century, the Valley did not record major floods in the valley, largely thanks to lessons learnt and reparative measures which were put in place. However, in 1929, the Valley grappled with yet another major flood, which mainly affected parts of what is today Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.

While the Valley stayed relatively flood-free for the following two decades, immediately after independence, Kashmir was hit by a flood in 1948. Two years later, in September 1950, another major flood hit the state, with nearly 100 people losing their lives. The flood was, rather unsurprisingly, caused by the Jhelum‚Äôs overflow. According to a Hindustan Times report from Jammu, ‚Äúmore than 15,000 houses have either collapsed or been damaged and over 100 people lost their lives in the heavy rains and floods in Jammu district."" The then Maharaja of Kashmir, Hari Singh, donated a sum of ‚Çπ 24,000 for the relief of flood victims, while the Maharani donated ‚Çπ 10,000.

In August-September of 1957, another major flood was recorded in Jammu and Kashmir, with the Valley feeling its devastating impact. The floods almost submerged the entire valley. In a Hindustan Times dispatch from Jammu (Sep 2), the then Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad was quoted as saying that, ‚Äúthe floods recorded in Jammu and Kashmir were the highest ever recorded in the state, and that the damage caused by them was colossal.""

Two years later, in July 1959, the state witnessed yet another massive ‚Äúglacial"" flood, perhaps its worst ever at the time, when four days of incessant rains lashed the valley and Srinagar, triggering the Jhelum. The Hindu reported, ‚ÄúThe swirling flood waters of the Jhelum River touched 30.25 feet on 5 July, over six points above the danger level."" The rainfall that lashed the state was so severe that then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who was enroute to a survey of the damage caused by the floods, had to return to Delhi less than five hours after take-off from Palam. In a statement, the Prime Minister said, ‚ÄúI spent a day in the Kashmir Valley yesterday. There can be no doubt about the calamity that has descended upon the Jammu and Kashmir state because of these floods and the tremendous damage they have done. What is distressing is that many of the development works which have been built up in recent years have been washed away and we have to start anew. Both the state and the central government will give help.""

While the state did witness floods thereafter in the following three decades, the one in 1992 was unprecedented in terms of its fury. Recording its heaviest rainfall since 1959, the 1992 floods were most devastating, purely in terms of casualties. According to newspaper reports from 1992, over 200 people lost their lives and the floods left over 60,000 people marooned in several north-western border districts. However, it is also worth noting that parts of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir bore the brunt of these floods, with over 2,000 deaths reported in that part.

While flash floods in the region, mainly triggered by a combination of heavy rainfall and landslides are common, the state has also witnessed massive floods caused by a cloudburst in the Leh-Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir.

The cloudburst, which occurred on 6 August 2010, triggered flash floods in the area after a night of heavy downpour. While it only lasted for half an hour, the devastation caused by the cloudburst was enormous. It destroyed many buildings in the city of Leh, including hospitals and several communication lines that connected it with the rest of the state, and indeed the country. Over 250 people were reported dead in the floods triggered by the cloudburst.

The worst floods in Jammu and Kashmir in the past 60 years and the subsequent devastation are due to a combination of unprecedented and intense rain, mismanagement, unplanned urbanisation and a lack of preparedness, Sunita Narain, director-general, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said on Wednesday.

A CSE analysis showed the floods were a manifestation of an extreme weather event linked to climate change. Ms. Narain said the changing rainfall pattern in India was part of extreme events which followed a trend. She called for a national action plan to forecast floods.

In an analysis of extreme events in India from 2005 to 2013, Chandra Bhushan, CSE deputy director-general, said the four events he studied ‚Äî from the Mumbai floods in 2005 to the recent floods in Jammu and Kashmir ‚Äî were either attributed to interaction between western disturbances and the monsoon system, excessive rain or freak unusual events; there was no mention of climate change.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests had expressed no opinion on the frequency of these extreme events, and there was complete silence on their link to climate change, Mr. Bhushan pointed out.

Extreme events In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fourth assessment report, said extreme rainfall events were set to increase over the Indian subcontinent. In its fifth assessment report, the IPCC said the intensity of rainfall in India would increase. A study by B.N. Goswami of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in 2006 had predicted changes in rainfall across India and especially over the Himalayan range, which would have a high impact in the region, apart from the west coast and central India.

The study of data between 1950 and 2000 showed that the incidence of heavy and very heavy rainfall (more than 100 mm and 150 mm/ a day) had increased and moderate rainfall decreased.

Jammu and Kashmir does not have a flood forecasting system, not even a separate disaster management plan, said Ms Narain. In 2004, a remote sensing data-based study of Jammu and Kashmir had shown that 55 per cent of wetlands, drainage channels and water bodies had been encroached upon. Ms Narain said Jammu and Kashmir had an intricate system of water management. The lake areas had diminished, the holding capacity of many water bodies had gone down, and houses were built in places they should never have been, she pointed out.

New Delhi, September 10, 2014: As Jammu and Kashmir continues to reel under its worst floods in 60 years, which have stranded over 6 lakh people and killed about 200, the attention is slowly veering towards the reasons and causes behind this unprecedented natural disaster. An analysis by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) suggests that this could very well be another manifestation of an extreme weather event ‚Äì induced by a changing climate.

‚ÄúThe Kashmir floods are a grim reminder that climate change is now hitting India harder. In the last 10 years, several extreme rainfall events have rocked the country, and this is the latest calamity in that series,‚Äù said Chandra Bhushan, CSE deputy director general and the head of its climate change team.

CSE researchers have compiled a list of such extreme events ‚Äì these include the Mumbai floods of 2005, the Leh cloudburst of 2010 and the Uttarakhand floods of 2013. In each of these disasters, thousands have died and the economic losses incurred have run into thousands of crores of rupees.

As was the case with some of the previous extreme rainfall events, the scale of disaster in J&K has been exacerbated by unplanned development ‚Äì especially on the riverbanks. In the last 100 years, more than 50 per cent of the lakes, ponds and wetlands of Srinagar have been encroached upon for constructing buildings and roads. The banks of the Jhelum river have been taken over in a similar manner, vastly reducing the river‚Äôs drainage capacity. Naturally, these areas have suffered the most.

The tragedy in J&K, says Chandra Bhushan, is that the state has not been prepared to handle such extreme rainfall events. In fact, J&K does not have a flood forecasting system. Its disaster management system is also rudimentary.

The climate connect

Heavy and very heavy rainfall events in India has increased over the past 50-60 years. A study done by B. N. Goswami of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, shows that between 1950 and 2000, the incidence of heavy rainfall events (> 100 mm/day) and very heavy events (>150 mm/day) have increased and moderate events (5-100 mm/day) have decreased.

Most climate models also predict that India will be hit more and more by extreme rainfall events as the world continues to warm in the coming decades.

According to the latest analysis by the Working Group II of the IPCC Assessment Report (AR5), floods and droughts are likely to increase in India. India will get more rainfall but in lesser number of rainy days. Increase in extreme precipitation during monsoons is also predicted.

The IPCC‚Äôs 2011 Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation ‚Äì abbreviated as the SREX report ‚Äì presents projections for the period 2071-2100. It points to increasing incidents of more frequent and intense heavy precipitation over most regions.

What, then, should India do? Sunita Narain, director general of CSE, says: To begin with, the Indian government must discard its ostrich-like policy and get out of its denial mode. We will have to see the linkages between climate change and the events such as those unfolding in J&K. We will have to accept that climate change is going to affect us more and more in the future. We will, therefore, have to start preparing to adapt to the changing climate.‚Äù

India should start internalising climate change adaptation in all developmental policies and programme. From building of cities infrastructure to agriculture and from water supply to energy infrastructure, we will have make changes to incorporate climate change impacts, says Narain.

Chandra Bhushan adds: ‚ÄúIndia will also have to proactively work with other countries to reduce emissions to control the warming of the planet. Most studies show that India is one of the most vulnerable countries. A warmer planet will affect India severely ‚Äì and its poor would be the worst impacted.‚Äù

For six years, owing to an aquifer that South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) engineers now claim they ‚Äúmissed‚Äù during the time of soil-testing, water has been constantly flowing into the basement of the hospital.

As construction workers dug two floors underground to provide parking at the eight-storey multi-speciality hospital, the water from the aquifer filled the basement, which the workers have been pumping out continuously.

The ambitious project, approved by the unified corporation in 2008, remains under construction even two and a half years post deadline. The project was approved at a cost of approximately Rs 31 crore. However, due to delays and cost escalation, the present expenditure stands well over Rs 52 crore, according to Leader of the Opposition in SDMC Farhad Suri.

‚ÄúThis is double-speak on behalf of the SDMC staff as, on the one hand, they say they conducted soil-testing at the site and, on the other, they claim anywhere you dig in the area, water is bound to spring up,‚Äù Suri said.

Speaking to Newsline, Leader of the House in SDMC Subhash Arya said the funds for the hospital were provided to the corporation in phases, which caused the delay in construction. He said tenders for electricity and other fittings were being finalised, but ‚Äúa final date for completion cannot yet be fixed‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe hospital needs an investment of an additional Rs 3 crore. We will provide that soon and hopefully the project will be completed this year,‚Äù Arya said.

The hospital, named after former BJP MLA from Kalkaji Poornima Sethi, was expected to be completed within two and a half years. Until now, only the structure of the 100-bed hospital is ready and utility services, sewer and water connections as well as equipment for the hospital have been arranged.

SRINAGAR

As Omar Abdullah government is waiting for the Rs 1000 crore grant that Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on the second day of his aerial visit to flood devastated Kashmir, New Delhi has raised a demand of Rs 650 crore. This substantial amount envisages the costs that IAF has raised for the rescue operations and the initial relief material (Biscuits etc) that was air dropped.

Official sources said a formal bill was yet to be received by the state government but the officials have been sounded about the costs that involved in the ‚Äúmassive‚Äù rescue and relief operations by the army, the IAF, the NDRF and other forces. The information came to the state at a time when it was waiting for the first penny from the Rs 1000 crore grant that Modi announced on September 7 when he could drive up to Humhama from the technical airport and flew back after an aerial survey.

The government expects the bills being raised would possibly be deducted from the aid already announced by the government of India.

This information was part of some of the revelations that Omar Abdullah government made in a meeting with traders late last night. The objective of the meeting was to persuade the trade from protesting on the streets, an idea that trade rejected for ‚Äúvery valid reasons‚Äù.

Individuals who were part of the meeting said Omar was visibly upset over the tardy response that the flood devastated people were getting from his government both at political and the official level.

Trade singled out the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù that the Kashmir got from the central government in last six weeks after the floods. The first thing that the central government did was to fly its Income Tax office to Jammu and issue the notices to the traders. Some of the traders who were inundated received the notice within hours after being rescued by the volunteers, the trade said. Omar, according to an insider termed notices shameful.

The second issue that traders highlighted was how BSNL forced its clients to cough up the bills of September when there was no service and literally there was no address of New Delhi‚Äôs PSU in Kashmir. Most of the trade had to pay the bill merely to save their cell phone numbers which are now part of the individual identity of the mobile phone users.

At the same time, however, the trade did not spear the state government and its entities. They specially mentioned the state owned J&K Bank that, according to traders, charged the interest on the loans for the month of September when entire Valley including most of the bank‚Äôs outposts were under water. A shocked Omar reacted to the decision using very bad adjectives, sources said.

Omar could not justify the functioning of his government in the meeting, sources said. Trade mentioned the tardy implementation of the initiatives that were already announced. Even after six weeks of the tragedy, the state government has not dispensed even Rs 100 crore so far. The state government has made more purchases by debit to SDRF for the public infrastructure than on the relief front, sources said.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Sunita Narain is an environmental activist. She is also the editor of Down To Earth magazine and the Director of the Centre of Science and Environment, based in New Delhi.

India-administered Kashmir, located in the Himalayas in the country‚Äôs north, has been totally devastated by floods ‚Äì the worst in more than 60 years.

Even as the region grapples with the aftermath of the swirling waters, which have left more than 250 dead and millions homeless, the question is why this flood? Is this enormous tragedy a natural event or could it have been prevented by better weather forecasting data? Was the state‚Äôs preparedness with disasters adequate at all?

But more importantly, is there a link between the repeated floods occurring in the Himalayas and climate change? And if so, what can the country do to cope with a disaster of this scale and magnitude?

The answers are not simple. The fact is that unseasonable and extreme rainfall began in the region on the night of September 2. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued a warning about the possibility of heavy to very heavy rainfall. But it was not heeded. It can be argued that such warnings are rarely ‚Äúactionable‚Äù ‚Äì governments do not comprehend that such rainfalls could have horrific consequences and so do not act in time.

But rain did wreak havoc in this high Himalayan region. In some places, it was 400 percent more than the monthly average. In no time, the city of Srinagar was submerged. The government of India-administered Kashmir, in the words of its chief minister, was ‚Äúcompletely paralysed‚Äù.

It would seem that the flood came unexpectedly; that the waters of Jhelum ‚Äì the river that flows through Srinagar ‚Äì rose without warning. But it is not, as I maintain, so simple.

Carbon emissions



It was barely a year ago that Uttarakhand, another Himalayan state, was devastated by floods. There, also, the rainfall was unexpected and extremely high, and authorities had ignored warnings. Raging floodwaters killed more than 5,000 people and many are still missing. The human tragedy in Uttarakhand was enormous.

The fact is that there is evidence proving a change in global weather patterns and its natural variability, ie, climate change, brought about by man-made carbon emissions is heating up the atmosphere faster than normal.

Scientists who study monsoons tell us that they are beginning to make the distinction between a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù monsoon and an extreme amount of rain. Remember that monsoons are generally confounding natural events that are hard to predict and even harder to pin down. Even then scientists are able to find a change in patterns.

Climate models predict that heavy rain events will increase over the Indian subcontinent. The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change reports confirm that climate change will lead to an increase in frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of extreme weather events.

This is further confirmed by Indian scientists working at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, based in Pune, who have found that very heavy and heavy rainfall events ‚Äì over 150-100 mm/day ‚Äì are on the increase while moderate events are decreasing over the Indian subcontinent.

There is also evidence that the Himalayan region will be the worst hit with extreme rain events. Given that this is the world‚Äôs youngest and most fragile mountain region, it spells big trouble.

But this is not all. All this is further complicated by the fact that multiple factors affect weather and another set of multiple factors affect its severity and impact.

In other words, the causes of devastation following extreme events ‚Äì such as droughts or floods ‚Äì are often complicated, and mismanagement of resources and poor planning also share the blame.

Kashmir‚Äôs unusually high rainfall was only part of the problem. The state does not have a flood forecasting system or capacity for disaster preparedness.

Most of the natural drainage channels have been destroyed due to utter mismanagement. The traditional system of flood management was to channelise the water from the Himalayas into lakes and water channels. The Dal and Nageen lakes in Srinagar are not just its beauty spots but also its sponges.

The water from the massive catchment comes into the lakes, which are interconnected. More importantly, each lake has its flood discharge channel from where the water spills over for drainage. But over time, we have forgotten the art of drainage ‚Äì we only see land for building, nothing for water.

Climate change action

The attitude is, it will rain for a few days and why should we ‚Äúwaste‚Äù land for this. This is what has happened in Srinagar. Residential buildings have come up in the low-lying areas of the city, flood channels have been encroached upon or simply neglected. Now, when the extreme and heavy rains come ‚Äì with greater frequency and intensity because of climate change ‚Äì the water has nowhere to go. Floods and devastation are inevitable.

So, all this makes for a double-whammy: On the one hand, we are mismanaging our water resources, intensifying floods and droughts. On the other hand, climate change is beginning to make the country even more vulnerable because of increased frequency of extreme weather events.

This is the real tragedy of the floods that are hitting Kashmir. And only if we can learn the real lesson behind it can we find ways of dealing with it in the future.

First, it requires countries such as India to raise the importance of climate change action ‚Äì the need for an ambitious and equitous agreement with the world community. As yet the world, particularly the rich and already developed world, is doing too little to cut its emissions that cause climate change.

Secondly, it requires accepting that dealing with climate change impacts is urgent and imperative. Adaptation will require relearning the art and science of water management so that regions such as Kashmir can cope with excess rain in the future.

It also means increased capacity of forecasting and information dissemination so that people are aware of the dangers and lives are not lost.

This is a sign of what the future holds. It is time we read the writing on the wall.

delhi,2014,https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/09/kashmir-floods-why-deadly-india/,12-Sep-14,Why the Kashmir Floods Have Been So Deadly,"



This story originally appeared in CityLab and is republished as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Junaid Rashid finally got his father on the phone today. For the past six days, he had no idea if his family in Srinagar city was safe. Rashid‚Äôs family and an estimated 600,000 others have been stranded in India‚Äôs flooded Kashmir region for the past week.

‚ÄúIn my 30 years, I haven‚Äôt seen a flood like this,‚Äù says Rashid, a doctor based in Delhi. An estimated 200 people have lost their lives on the Indian side of the contested border (another 250 or more are estimated to have died on the Pakistani side). As rescue operations continue, the number is only going up.

How can there have been so many fatalities in a region long known to be flood-prone?

It happened because of a combination of urban policy and program failures, says Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator at the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People.

The flood zones surrounding the waterways that run through the Kashmir region are not clearly demarcated based on how much flood load the river can carry. Because of this, no clearly defined rules or regulations exist about where it‚Äôs safe to build. The result is what Thakkar calls ‚Äúencroachment‚Äù of the river bed‚Äîresidential and government buildings (even hospitals) have been cropping up on vulnerable areas near the Jhelum River. The river ‚Äúembankments,‚Äù meant to stop the flooding, only give a ‚Äúfalse sense of security,‚Äù he says, enabling more careless building.

Local water bodies such as lakes have also been neglected, and so their water-holding capacity is negligible. Existing and future hydropower projects are partly responsible.

‚ÄúThese projects, all of them involve damming of rivers, submergence, deforestation, tunneling of the rivers, blasting, diversion of the rivers,‚Äù Thakkar says. All of those processes increase the possibility of landslides and flash-floods.

The problem lies in the way government and builders in India have been intervening in traditional urban planning and management practices, says Saleem Beg of the Indian National Trust for Art and Culture Heritage.

In the past, only those who had river-related occupations tended to live by the river and evacuate immediately at the first flood warning. Residential areas, including villages, in this region were traditionally built on higher ground. Natural topography was used to divert flood water, and simple early-warning systems were in place, he says.

Now, those traditional systems have been ‚Äúgiven a pass,‚Äù he says. Lands that once acted as natural flood sinks are now home to growing residential communities, and the waterways have been turned into roads in the name of development.

Villages consisting of flimsy infrastructure have been built on these lowlands, he says. At least 450 of them are now under water.‚ÄùWe don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing, what they‚Äôre eating, how they‚Äôre surviving, Beg says. ‚ÄúPeople have no idea because everything is televised, the televised thing looks good. The problem is beneath that‚Äîwhere television doesn‚Äôt reach.‚Äù

The government‚Äôs meteorological department did issue a warning starting September 2, but either people didn‚Äôt hear about it or they didn‚Äôt realize how serious it could become. And once floods were in full-force, the rescue efforts were criticized for being late.

There is no concept of disaster management in place, Beg says. The National Disaster Management Authority doesn‚Äôt function at the local level and faces bureaucratic stalemate at the national level (the authority could not be reached for comment.)

Some progress has been made, though. So far, the government‚Äôs National Disaster Response Force and the Army has rescued 100,000 people. Rashid‚Äôs father told him that rescue helicopters have been circling around every hour, relaying supplies. The water has been receding in places and some phone lines are back up.

Beg‚Äôs own mother was rescued two days into the flood, but he says it was a matter of chance more than anything else.

Nobody planned it, it just happens that the boat was going by and they caught on to it.‚Äù",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

An unexpected high tide has left a major portion of Sagar Island flooded, leaving environmentalists worried about its future.Sea water gushed into the island through Muriganga river on July 14, causing extensive damage to crops and destroying homes. Around 10 villages were affected and they continue to be submerged by the untimely rise in water level, which could have been triggered by a change in climate in the region, fear experts.It is usually the shara-sharir baan (neap tide) that hits Sunderbans twice a year ‚Äî in April and September. But it rarely triggers a flood. This sudden influx of water was not neap tide, say locals and experts. It was much fiercer and struck at least two months ahead of the neap tide, they say.‚ÄúIt could be the result of climate change since the water level has been rising in the Sunderbans. Nothing like this has ever happened in 70 years so people were not ready for it. Paddy cultivation and betel plantations ‚Äî the main sources of livelihood in the island ‚Äî have been severely affected. The fields are still under a foot and half of water and salinity has reduced soil fertility. No crop will grow in the flooded villages for at least 2-3 years,‚Äù said Sudipta Bhattacharjee of SAFE , an NGO that has been studying the impact of the high-tide.Some of the affected villages were severely damaged by Cyclone Aila in 2010.What worries environmentalists most is the possible trigger. If this wasn‚Äôt neap tide, then it could happen yet again next month, they fear. ‚ÄúSince this doesn‚Äôt seem to be the neap tide, we are possibly in for another flooding next month. Last month‚Äôs flooding might have been the result of rising sea-level, but we are not sure. There could be other environmental factors at work as well. The severity of the flood is indeed worrying and a repeat could be disastrous,‚Äù said environmentalist Amalesh Misra who runs the NGO Paribesh Unnayan Parishad (PUP).SAFE and PUP are assessing the impact of the flood and trying to unearth the reason for it. They have already detected a major deterioration in soil condition and loss of biodiversity. ‚ÄúIt will now be difficult to grow high-yield varieties of paddy or betel due to the high saline and acid levels in the soil. It may improve slightly if it rains heavily and dilutes the salt. But microorganisms have died out due to the influx of sea water and this has adversely affected soil fertility,‚Äù said Bhattacharjee. The water level in the adjacent Buriganga river is now being closely monitored.Locals are bracing for September when the neap tide is expected. ‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt, then we may conclude that it struck early. But then, we must find it out why it happened,‚Äù said Misra. Environmentalist and lead author of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change Joyashree Roy felt this could have been one of the erratic and extreme climatic events that would now be more frequent. ‚ÄúIt is the trend worldwide and Sunderbans is particularly vulnerable in terms of climate change. It has been affected by both a rise in water-level and erratic rainfall. Rainfall pattern, in fact, has changed across the country.A sudden flood like the one in Sagar Island is a cause for concern. It is a sure sign of climate change. Events like this can‚Äôt be predicted and we are likely to see them more frequently now,‚Äù said Roy.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
delhi,2014,https://kashmirlife.net/what-made-september-7-floods-so-bad-66696/,18-Oct-14,What Made September 7 Floods So Bad?,"by Athar Parvaiz

It has been over a month since a massive flood left the central and southern areas of Kashmir devastated killing 281 people and rendering thousands of families homeless besides damaging property worth one trillion rupees as per the official estimates.

And now, not surprisingly, questions about disaster preparedness and management are being asked. What made this disaster so bad? Could it have been averted? Could its impact have been minimized? Was there enough preparedness for the disaster? And why was the response so lousy and weak?

Government Clueless

With questions growing over governmental apathy, environmental negligence and flaws in reading the warning signs, officials say they are still clueless about the why and how of the worst floods in Kashmir valley‚Äôs recorded history.

‚ÄúWe are still not able to analyze what happened on September 7,‚Äù Pawan Kotwal the Commissioner Secretary for Flood Control said during a recent press conference. His department, Kotwal said, would study satellite images besides requesting New Delhi‚Äôs assistance for analyzing the disaster.

What the officials like Kotwal fail to answer is the misinterpretation or no interpretation of the data which was available with the meteorological department.

‚ÄúThere was a record 400mm precipitation in just four days which meant a huge disaster was in the making considering Kashmir‚Äôs topography, the limited carrying capacity of River Jhelum and its spill-over channel besides Kashmir‚Äôs proneness to flooding disasters. It is surprising why it did not serve as a warning,‚Äù Prof Bashir Ahmad, who teaches Geography in S P College, told Kashmir Life.

Even the flood control officials were constantly saying that the discharge in the river had created a new record with the water flowing more than 14 feet above the danger mark at Sangam in south Kashmir. Many say that it should have been quite easy for the flood control department to interpret. If they knew the carrying capacity of the River; why didn‚Äôt they do the simple arithmetic whether it commiserated with the carrying capacity downstream?

‚ÄúIt was not a flash flood where you have no breathing time; this was a disaster which was slowly building up and, therefore, an eye-opener. The bright spark was always there as the water kept rising above the danger mark. But, unfortunately, the officials failed to give clear and analytical warnings based on the available data,‚Äù Prof Bashir observed.

When you give simple warnings [like the water is rising above the danger mark], it hardly leaves an impact; more so in our society. But, if the people, based on a scientific and technical interpretation of the information and facts, were told in no uncertain terms that the banks of the Jhelum will breach at many places given the amount of surplus water and the water will inundate most of the city areas covering one and a half story of the houses, common people and thousands of shopkeepers would have definitely paid heed and might have even saved their property by shifting it to safer places.

For the central government in New Delhi, a series of disasters in recent years should have thrown up some important lessons. That is why it is blamed for not doing enough for effective disaster preparedness and improving disaster management though, on paper, the country‚Äôs disaster management system and preparedness has hardly any loopholes

The 10 Percent Syndrome

Requesting anonymity, a top official of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said that only 10 per cent is done or implemented from what is written on official documents or discussed during meetings regarding disaster preparedness and management.

The result: Replay of faulty execution of disaster management operations and ill-preparedness for disasters of the magnitude, which recently struck Jammu and Kashmir and the north-eastern state of Meghalaya, often invite criticism from sections ranging from disaster victims to observers and analysts.

While speaking on the foundation day of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on September 29, the union junior home minister, Kiren Rijiju blamed the state governments in Jammu and Kashmir and Meghalaya saying the way they managed the September disasters was ‚Äúnot up to the mark.‚Äù

He emphasized that India will have to play a bigger role in disaster management, at least in South Asia. But, for India to do that there has to be an effective mechanism in place in all the parts of this country often called the sub-continent.

According to a paper by the researchers of IIT Kanpur, India has been traditionally vulnerable to natural disasters on account of its unique geo-climatic conditions. Floods, droughts, cyclones, earthquakes, and landslides have been a recurrent phenomenon. About 60 per cent of the landmass is prone to earthquakes of various intensities; over 40 million hectares is prone to floods. The paper has listed a number of weaknesses and problem areas like inadequate early warning systems, inadequate and slow relief, slow rehabilitation and reconstruction, poor management of finances for disaster relief etc.

A number of states in India do not have their own disaster management authorities and the disaster management continues to be the additional charge of the principal secretaries revenue in all the states. ‚ÄúWhat can they do for disaster management when they already have enough tasks at hand from their own department,‚Äù the NDMA official said.

Lack of Coordination and Planning

The lack of coordination and cooperation between the states and the centre is another problem area. Talking with special reference to disaster response in Kashmir, the NDMA official says that the Jammu & Kashmir government did not respond to repeated requests from NDMA since 2011 for providing space for a National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team in Kashmir.

The preparedness of Jammu and Kashmir‚Äôs own disaster response force got exposed when they could not appear on the scene following the disaster for days together. When Kashmir Life asked a top official of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) why it took more than a week for his troops to appear for the rescue and relief operations, he made no bones to express his helplessness. ‚ÄúWhat could we do with empty hands? We didn‚Äôt have the required wherewithal like boats or safety jackets for rescue operations,‚Äù he said.

According to insiders in SDRF, the ‚Äúspecial force‚Äù was given 90 million rupees only after the disaster. No basic tools like boats, jackets, landslide clearance JCBs etc. for fighting the disasters have been procured for SDRF founded in 2012.

Flood control Programme

The state government led by Omar Abdullah has been playing the classic blame game. Its claim that the Central Water Commission (CWC) in New Delhi rejected a ‚Äòwell thought out plan‚Äô for flood control in Kashmir for lack of minute details has been a standard response from the chief minister to other government officials.

Over the past several weeks, the Jammu and Kashmir government keeps maintaining that the September 7 destructive flood could have been averted if the state government‚Äôs INR 2200 crore flood control programme in 2010 was accepted by the central government in New Delhi.

Mir Javid Jaffer, the chief engineer for flood control says that the project was aimed at raising the carrying capacity of River Jhelum and the spill-over flood channel from the current 50,000 cusecs to 120,000 cusecs and the dredging of outfall channels downstream.

The Jammu and Kashmir government and its flood control department are right in saying that this disaster wouldn‚Äôt have been a possibility or the damage could have been much lesser if its flood control project was accepted. But, it has no idea why the central water commission (CWC) would accept its project which lacked technical details.

‚ÄúWe had no objection to what the Jammu and Kashmir government was apprehending, but they only submitted a tentative project based on mere assumptions and failed to support their project with the technical details,‚Äù Chander Pal Singh, chief engineer flood management at CWC New Delhi told Kashmir Life over the phone.

‚ÄúIf its flood control department had not the required human resource to support the project with technical details, it could have outsourced the project to some agency,‚Äù he said adding it would have cost them somewhere around half a million rupees. ‚ÄúWe waited for months together for these details which they failed to provide,‚Äù Singh said that CWC is still ready to support them, but they still need to submit a technically correct project. ‚ÄúThe recent disaster can, of course, help them.‚Äù

Mir and the chief minister Omar Abdullah say that the disaster has proved them right. ‚ÄúFortunately, the disaster has now proved it practically. Now there is a practical proof and we don‚Äôt need to prove it anymore,‚Äù Abdullah has been saying repeatedly after the disaster. Had they been able to convince CWC for granting the required amount in time, their assertions would have been much more different in phraseology and meaningfulness?

Massive Encroachments

During the past three decades, water bodies in Srinagar city which include River Jhelum, its spill-over channel and various water bodies have been encroached upon with some built-up areas extending right inside these water bodies.

Many of the flooded areas in recent floods include some areas which are actually the extension areas of wetlands which had served as water sinks during the huge flooding of Srinagar city in 1902. In fact, the office of Srinagar Development Authority (SDA), off-shoot of SKIMS hospital and many other important government buildings have been constructed in Bemina just adjacent to the flood spill-over channel and a wetland. And a few more are coming up in the same area.

As people watched in awe the flooding of the city in the past few weeks, some old men vividly recalled the days when they used to fish in some areas of the city which are now replaced by posh residential colonies. ‚ÄúPeople used to throng this area for fishing when I was a young boy,‚Äù Muzaffar Mir, an elderly man said about Bemina, a sprawling residential area in Srinagar which used to be a wetland.

Even the banks of River Jhelum, which is regarded by many as the sleeping tiger, was not spared. It was officially announced by chief minister Omar Abdullah after the September 7 floods that many influential politicians were involved in the encroachment of river banks of Jhelum in some areas of the city. Just imagine the impact of such statements if made in the nick of time and followed with the required action!

What is more concerning is the fact that many residential colonies have come up in the lower areas along the banks of spill-over flood channel which runs through the city.","The channel was constructed in 1903 to divert the flood water from the city. But, the channel has been encroached upon in many places and the water is now flowing through the residential areas.

While New Delhi claims that Kashmir is an inseparable part of India, the government has left flood victims to fend for themselves

An absent state, a militarised zone

Willfully neglected by New Delhi and used by the Indian army as a PR exercise, flood-affected Kashmiris look to their own

By Dilnaz Boga

‚ÄúDrove across South Kashmir, battered and bruised. Just reached Srinagar, the city in shambles, can smell death in the air KashmirFloods,‚Äù writes a Facebooker who is on his way to meet his family in Kashmir almost two weeks after the flood killed 74 in the Valley.

‚ÄúSOS we needs rafts. Send us rafts from Bombay,‚Äù reads a tweet posted by a desperate youth from Downtown Srinagar to a friend outside the Valley.

‚ÄúEven traffic constables are not on the streets and it is causing havoc on the few roads that are open for ferrying relief supplies,‚Äù complains another social media user.

The absence of the state is at the heart of the calamity that Kashmiris have been facing. The ‚Äúrescue effort‚Äù in a region considered to be one of the most highly militarised zones in the world is shocking indeed.

‚ÄúThey (security forces) had lists when they came to rescue people in our neighbourhood. They had been instructed to rescue government officials and Pandits, not local Muslims. They were sticking to the list,‚Äù claims an agitated young man while speaking over the phone from Rajbaugh, an affluent area where bureaucrats reside.

‚ÄúThey flew so low that our boat overturned! Then the soldiers dumped biscuits and expired medicines in the filthy floodwater. How can we use these?‚Äù asks an angry flood survivor from south Kashmir.

Structural violence has been woven into the state‚Äôs rescue plan in Kashmir. The apparent tactic of ignoring the masses in India‚Äôs only Muslim majority state and selectively rescuing Indian tourists and bureaucrats has elicited condemnation from Kashmiri civil society all over the world.

Instead of streamlining aid distribution to make it easier for aid agencies, sources revealed that the state has made it mandatory for aid agencies to procure permission from the local SP in order to release relief packages at the cargo distribution point at Srinagar airport.

‚ÄúThis will not only delay our effort, but also involve paperwork. At a time like this, should we run around asking for permission from police?‚Äù asked an agitated camp coordinator.

‚ÄúThe administration, without taking our views into account, has also asked us to keep our trucks outside the gate of the airport as it is a high security zone. Are we supposed to walk for a kilometre out of the airport with relief material on our heads?‚Äù he added. No official communication has been released to this but relief workers in different parts of Srinagar claim this measure is very much in place.

Manipulation of channels of aid to state-sponsored NGOs and selective meting out of relief material like blankets, disinfectants, medicines and inflatable rafts to certain sections by the government has magnified the alienation felt by the Kashmiris, who have endured over two decades of unbridled state terror.

In an article titled, ‚ÄòIn J&K floods, army only thought Indian citizens needed help‚Äô, on September 19, 2014, Lt. General D.S. Hooda told The Times of India (Mumbai edition) that 30,000 troops were directly participating in the rescue efforts.

Aware of the damage the flood had caused, he stated, ‚ÄúWater supply was hit, electricity was cut, hospitals went under water and communication systems were totally down.‚Äù Dismissing the notion that stone-pelters had targeted troops, choppers and boats, Hooda stated that out of the ‚Äúthousands of boats deployed by the army, there were only one or two incidents of stone-pelting‚Äù.

Commenting on the skewed coverage by the Indian news channels on how the army has saved lives, a Kashmiri doctor settled in Europe says, ‚ÄúThis has got to be the largest psychological operation by the establishment through the Indian media; if they show the lies often enough, people will believe them. Meanwhile, reports on Indian tourists being saved by the security forces highlight the fact that tourists and bureaucrats were the only ones on the government‚Äôs mandate.‚Äù

In the name of embedded journalism, Indian television channels chose to focus on the army‚Äôs rescue operations in selected locations in Jammu and Kashmir. But photographs from international new agencies told a completely different story ‚Äî a story that the Indian news channels deliberately ignored. Scores of Kashmiri youth took to the streets in a bid to rescue citizens from different areas of Kashmir, with the army nowhere in sight.

Sikhs, Pandits and Muslims saved each other after days of being stranded in their semi-submerged homes. ‚ÄúEven the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) was ignored by the army. Some of them were stranded without a raft and we fed them,‚Äù said a relief worker in downtown Srinagar. ‚ÄúRelief supplies were not sent to areas where there were 30 people stuck in one house in places like Bemina, which are still submerged,‚Äù said another aid worker.

With hardly any help from the state, local journalists and youth from mohalla committees have come to the aid of people caught in harrowing circumstances. Even as aid pours in from different parts of the sub-continent, a young volunteer from Srinagar expresses concern about winter. ‚ÄúIt is fast approaching. Look how cold the water is. It‚Äôs difficult to stand in it even for five minutes,‚Äù he says.

Freny Manecksha, a Mumbai-based journalist who was caught in the flood, recounts, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see rescue efforts by the army near the Kashmir University in Nigeen, at Rainawari or Khanyar in Downtown. At the relief camp, I heard they rescued people in the Rajbaugh area and at G. B. Pant Hospital. Mainly, it was the mohalla committees that helped the locals. Also, there was a lot of anxiety as people weren‚Äôt in touch with one another due to a breakdown in communication. There was no police control room information either.‚Äù

In the first few days of the calamity, locals had realised that mainly tourists would be rescued. The troops normally deployed on the streets of Srinagar were nowhere to be found. ‚ÄúThey were very angry with the Indian media and were cursing the chief minister. What they said about the chief minister can‚Äôt be printed,‚Äù Manecksha adds.

Around 1,800km away, Kashmiri students in Mumbai joined hands to help their loved ones back at home. An engineering student says, ‚ÄúOur institution has not backed us, but we can‚Äôt sit around doing nothing. I haven‚Äôt heard from my family but I know there will be a need for medicines and blankets as Kashmiris have lost everything, so we are doing whatever is in our capacity.‚Äù

Kashmiris across the country and even abroad have answered the call for help from the Valley. To prevent an epidemic, a Kashmiri doctor settled abroad has uploaded a document on risk and disease prevention during floods in English and Urdu to be distributed at relief camps.

@NaqKash is one of the many Twitter handles that liaised between those at the grassroots level and those who want to be part of the rescue efforts. In fact, flood rescue groups on Facebook and Twitter managed to connect some of the rescuers to those stranded in their attics for over seven days.

Messages of scarcity of fresh drinking water have prompted Kashmiris from Delhi and Mumbai to look up fresh water springs in the nearby areas and post their locations. Lists of required medicines are uploaded from the flood-hit areas, numbers of those needing rescue exchanged and maps of functional routes updated and disseminated to streamline the relief operations.

In an effort to raise funds and collect essentials, some students outside the Valley have gone out of their way to co-ordinate with those in need despite the communication lines being down for over a week. ‚ÄúIn some areas, the network is slowly coming back to life, but even that is intermittent,‚Äù says a relief worker from a camp closest to the airport.

But trolls and anti-Kashmir elements on Facebook have infiltrated some of the rescue groups and recommended that people use certain chemicals, which are in fact poisonous, to disinfect their homes and localities. Politicising the calamity, trolls on social forums have praised the efficiency of the army and resorted to abusing the Kashmiri separatists while ridiculing Kashmir‚Äôs call for self-determination.

Journalist for the local paper Greater Kashmir, Majid Maqbool, wrote ‚ÄúOur tragedy, nature‚Äôs fury in this case, was turned into a spectacle by the news channels, a shameless PR exercise to boost the image of army in Kashmir. The subsequent ‚Äòrelief and rescue operations‚Äô in Kashmir thus became an image makeover opportunity for the army that was ably supported by all the news channels that were willing to come onboard. However, it must be pointed out here that almost all the Kashmir-based correspondents and video journalists despite themselves being at the receiving end of floods and some of them not knowing the whereabouts of their own families, deserve all the appreciation for covering the plight of flood hit people across Kashmir.‚Äù

Kashmiris have always known that to Delhi, the disputed territory is an ‚Äúintegral part of India‚Äù and that its abysmal human rights record shows that the Kashmiri people have never mattered through six decades of protracted struggle.

Aala Fazili, a relief co-ordinator at Humhama camp, a kilometre away from the airport, concludes that the Centre has actually behaved the way a coloniser or occupier behaves when humanitarian disasters afflict their subjects. ‚ÄúThey have shown a cold response, and undermined and underestimated the picture they have projected through its media to the world. After 20 days, there‚Äôs no presence of Indian institutions here.‚Äù

Interpreting the government‚Äôs response to the calamity, Fazili further explains, ‚ÄúThe Centre has issued an unofficial order on airlifting of only government aid from Delhi airport. So, every thing donated by NGOs is stuck. Thus they want to control the incoming relief and are for cibly making people accept only what they want to give them. The state propaganda through Indian media had been deflated, so now they want to exhaust us all so that people have no choice but to use government aid, something they had been refusing all this time. Delhi has used this calamity as a mechanism of controlling the people.‚Äù

Wards of death

In Srinagar, a house of healing became a house of horror the day the flood waters rushed in. Ignored by state rescuers, trapped patients and staff endured three days of hell

By Sheikh Saaliq

Somewhere in Sonwar, Srinagar, at the G.B. Pant Hospital in Srinagar, little children aged not more than 10 years and newborns, many of whom were restricted to their hospital beds, were battling for life as the floods hit Srinagar. There was much cacophony outside: people trapped in their houses and even on the rooftops of mosques waved frantically to helicopters hovering above for help. But once the flood water sped in, the only thing outsiders could hear were wails and cries. Minutes after, the G.B. Pant Hospital in Srinagar was afloat with dead children.

It has been 10 days since the Jhelum broke loose, destroying everything which came in its way. Within minutes, almost all of Srinagar was submerged. As most of the city recovers from the havoc created by the floods, people are slowly returning to their homes to flush out the remaining water and filth from their bedrooms and kitchens. But G.B. Hospital in Sonwar offers a haunted look. Nobody is there.

The reception area, where once doctors used to keep the inventory of the people going in, has been abandoned. In fact, all of the hospital is now desolate. Its corridors, once populated with patients, doctors, nurses and peons, remain empty.

The smell of medicines has been replaced by the nauseating stench of grit left behind by the flood waters.

In Srinagar, a house of healing became a house of horror the day the flood waters rushed in. Ignored by state rescuers, trapped patients and staff endured three days of hell

The halls, corridors and rooms of G.B Pant Hospital in Srinagar wear an eerie look, bearing mute testimony to the catastrophe that has just passed. The reception counter is still abandoned, the machinery in disrepair, and the beds almost unusable ‚Äî photos by the writer

The hospital beds are still connected with glucose bottles and the wires are still left dangling, dripping with muddy water.

The flood water which rose up to the second floor of this hospital, has left brown marks all over the walls. Under the ceilings, medicine drenched with flood water ‚Äî tablets, syringes and syrups, once meant for children, poke out from the mud filled inside the rooms. Outside, only water can be seen. And the make-shift ropes made from hospital curtains, which are left hanging from the first and second floor windows of the hospitals, from which patients evacuated.

Inside, Mohammad Ayoub, one of the caretakers of the hospital is cleaning the floors. His lowers folded up to his thighs, Ayoub sweeps the mud water from one corridor to another ‚Äî his eyes wandering across the hospital walls. ‚ÄúThis is the place where I have spent most of my life. Now it lays abandoned, as if cursed by witchcraft,‚Äù laments Ayoub.

He was inside the waiting room when water crashed through the hospital gates. Hearing a loud thud, he swiftly left to check what had happened. It was three in the morning. ‚ÄúIt took me a few seconds to peep out of the window to see what was going on, and within those few seconds, I could feel my feet under water.‚Äù

It took me a few seconds to peep out of the window to see what was going on, and within those few seconds, I could feel my feet under water.

Wading though knee deep water, Ayoub, his fellow caretakers and some people accompanying the patients started to evacuate the building. But the force of the water flooding in was such that no one could pass through it; nobody could leave.

‚ÄúIt was impossible to leave the building. The water was coming inside very fast. It felt like as if I was in a mountain stream. The only smart thing to do at that time was to take the patients to the upper floors. But it was too late,‚Äù Ayoub says.

Haji Ghulam Mohammad Mir remembers the cries of the people who were trapped inside the hospital. His house, just in the backyard of the hospital, is still deeply submerged in water. He says that he felt helpless at that time.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt do anything. My family and I went for safer grounds. The farther we went, the fainter the shrieks of the children were getting. I just couldn‚Äôt do anything to help the drowning children,‚Äù Mohammad says.

Once the terrified people started to move to the upper floors, the water had risen drastically. Almost all of the first floor was under water. The hospital beds were touching the ceiling and those who managed to escape found themselves on the first floor. Many children were safely moved up the stairs but the worst was yet to happen. A power cut turned everything dark.

A nurse who was on duty at the time recounts the incident as the worst nightmare of her life. Patients who were on life support had yet to be moved upstairs safely, she says. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt see anything. All we could hear were cries for help. It was mayhem and we knew death was upon us. I could barely breathe and somehow managed to take one kid in my arms and moved him to the first floor. After that I just couldn‚Äôt go back and save more lives,‚Äù the nurse said, who herself was rescued after three days by local volunteers.

Many children died that day in the hospital. However, no one knows the exact count. Mehraj-ud-din of Batamaloo was with his two sons in the hospital. Once he helped his two sons to safety, he himself saw dead bodies floating. ‚ÄúChildren did die that day, but I don‚Äôt know many. I myself closed eyes of three children. Later on, their bodies were taken to Badambagh morgue, where their families took them along for burial,‚Äù said Mehraj-ud-din, who had come to recover his blankets and tiffin boxes from the hospital. However, he could find nothing. Everything inside that was there before the floods had been washed away. Some of it lies buried in the rubble.

The people inside the hospital were saved after three long days. All calls for help and evacuation were left unanswered. The only thing people could feed on were ORS packets and glucose. The hospital canteen had already been washed away.

Ghulam Haider, who was inside the hospital at the time of flood, recounts the incident. ‚ÄúThe ordeal of the people who were stranded inside can be gauged by an incident when a person had nothing to eat for three days and he started to eat rotten food which was almost completely decayed,‚Äù says Haider.

Finally, it was the local volunteers who came to the rescue of the trapped. The water was still up to the first floor and people needed to be evacuated by boats.

The state‚Äôs inefficiency in rescuing people in time has angered locals; people inside the hospital and from its surrounding areas confirm that there was a complete ‚Äòfailure‚Äô from the side of the state. ‚ÄúState apparatus was nowhere. People could have been rescued at the earliest if the state had swung into action at the proper time. But they didn‚Äôt do anything,‚Äù says Krishan Singh Bedi, who lives just behind the hospital.

Ishfaq, a 22-year-old, had been rescuing people for almost two days. Once he came to know about the hospital being under water, he along with his friends came to evacuate the trapped people. The scenes he saw were enough to leave him shocked. People had made ropes from the curtains of the hospitals and were coming out from the windows into the water which was at least 14 feet high.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes. People were jumping into the water in desperate attempts to leave. We rowed over to the main gate of the hospital, which was under water, and rescued people in boats. It was horrific,‚Äù Ishfaq says. That day, he and his fellow volunteers rescued almost 100 people in their make-shifts boats.

Those who could be evacuated were taken out safely and moved to higher ground in the local relief camps. But the horror inside the hospital the day the water rushed in is something which the Medical Superintendent of the hospital will never forget.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how many children died that day. There was no time to keep count. But I buried children with my own bare hands,‚Äù he says.

A game of perceptions

While the historical antagonist plays Good Samaritan, forced dependency in flood relief threatens to push Kashmiri victims to survivor‚Äôs guilt and suicide

By Dilnaz Boga

‚ÄúHow can the oppressor let the oppressed be helped?‚Äù asked a Facebook user in India-held Kashmir, which has endured the worst floods in over a century.

‚ÄúHumanitarianism is always loaded with multiple meanings: when employed during a calamity in a conflict zone, it becomes even more problematic due to the urgency of the situation. It tends to overshadow the larger politics which the media is trying to overshadow yet again through its public relations exercise, even as it seeks to influence public opinion through its own agenda of denial, disinformation and delegitimisation,‚Äù wrote another Facebook user from Delhi.

The creation of forced dependency by the Indian state on relief material for the flood affected in Kashmir will have serious mental health repercussions on those who have borne the brunt of state terror, warn doctors based in Srinagar.

In a bid to ensure that locals are prevented from availing aid provided by civil NGOs, the government has unofficially asked relief seekers to produce permission from the police for the release of relief packages from Srinagar airport.

Monopolisation of aid has ensured that people of the valley end up solely depending on the state and its structures.

Absurdities reached new zeniths when an offer by the United Nations to intervene on humanitarian basis was also struck down by New Delhi.

With the recent aid blockade, psychiatrists warn that propaganda by the Indian media, portraying the army as the saviours of the valley‚Äôs inhabitants ‚Äúis bound to cause some cognitive dissonance in a population which is already grappling with the effect of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) due to living in one of the most highly militarised zones in the world.‚Äù

In psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental stress or discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time, or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas or values.

Some people might feel survivors‚Äô guilt for accepting aid from the same army which was responsible for the death of a family member or even their own torture in the past. They will feel guilty, as they have survived because of killers.

In the first fortnight after the deluge, quick action from community workers, Kashmiri groups outside the valley and pro-freedom leaders through their extensive networks, filled the lacuna that grew from absence of state participation in rescue efforts.

Simultaneously, as standard political PR exercise, political parties affiliated with the state whipped up propaganda about their successful intervention in the disturbed region. Two weeks after the deluge, members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) flew to Srinagar with aid from Delhi. Interestingly, J&K doesn‚Äôt even feature in the flood advisory of the Central Water Commission.

With power being used by the Centre to exacerbate the bleak situation, the condition on the ground is getting worse with winter looming. In the Sumbal area and around Wullar, the situation is such that people chase aid trucks for about 2km simply to get water, discloses a resident. Ironically, aid is being sent by local politicians to Kupwara, which has been unaffected ‚Äî all this for votes, exclaims a youth. Sources also reveal that the police on the outskirts of Srinagar stopped a truck full of relief material from Aligarh Muslim University and confiscated its contents, sending them to a government godown.

‚ÄúSo far, the majority has survived due to community effort by resistance leaders and not because of government intervention,‚Äù explains an aid worker from a camp in central Kashmir, who also complained about tonnes of relief material being sent back to Mumbai and Delhi from Srinagar by the authorities, this week.

‚ÄúThis restructuring of rules regarding aid release at the airport 15 days after the flood signifies another oppressive tactic. The state not only wants to exhaust the indigenous political groups that are working on the ground of the supplies they have, but also render them irrelevant in this time of crisis.

‚ÄúThe state wants to control the narrative in the media about what a great job they are doing by controlling the flow of aid and proving that Kashmiris are availing aid from India and that they should feel grateful,‚Äù says the aid worker.

A doctor who has already noticed some changes in people‚Äôs attitudes around him remarks, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just cognitive dissonance in Kashmir, but also outside the valley, where people‚Äôs ability to reason, modify or accommodate their initial observation of the army will change after they accept aid from them. Clearly, this is a part of a psychological operation to improve the image of the armed forces in Kashmir, because so far, the people have abstained from taking any help from the government, either through state-sponsored NGOs or the armed forces.‚Äù

Expecting the problem to blow out of proportion, he explains, ‚ÄúWith relief channels being strategically blocked, people have no choice but to depend on state channels. People have already started making exceptions in their perceptions of the security forces. The vilification campaign against the pro-freedom leaders in the Indian media is a part of the same psy-op to change the minds of Kashmiris about the international dispute,‚Äù he says.

This cognitive dissonance in people, doctors say, might lead to a higher suicide rate. A psychiatrist elucidates, ‚ÄúSome people might feel survivors‚Äô guilt for accepting aid from the same army which was responsible for the death of a family member or even their own torture in the past. They will feel guilty, as they have survived because of killers. This will lead to a higher suicide rate. These survivors should be told not to blame themselves. For example, it‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs the situation that demands this kind of response and that it is in fact help from an agency that is in charge of the response.‚Äù

Counsellors, to bring people out of survivor‚Äôs guilt, can also use hypothetical situations. For example, a patient may be told: ‚ÄúAn Indian goes to China and an earthquake occurs. The PLA comes to his rescue. After helping him, the PLA asks the survivor to record a video saying that the army is great for rescuing him and that India should now handover Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh to them. Is it logical to expect this argument?‚Äù

Survivors need to be told that helping someone doesn‚Äôt mean you believe in their political ideas, another doctor added. ‚ÄúAll this should be done at a wider level as part of the daily sermons or counselling sessions.‚Äù

A scientist from MS University ( MSU ), who studied flooding in three major rivers of Gujarat, has concluded that flooding in Sabarmati and even Mahi was much worse in the medieval times. Alpa Sridhar , a research scientist from the department of Geology of MS University, has for a decade been studying flood records in Sabarmati, Mahi and Narmada rivers. The study suggests phases of high and low frequency flood events over a span of 5,000 years. She studied deposits from Mahi that dated back to 5,000 years and of Sabarmati that were 1,500 years old.""The magnitude of floods during the medieval phase was eight to 10 times higher than the present. In Sabarmati, the discharge during the flood in 1400 AD was 15,680 cubic meter per second (cumecs), much higher than around 3,000 cumecs during the 1973 flood. Similarly, the discharge in Mahi basin around 5,000 years before present was about 25 times more than the present day,"" said Sridhar.Sridhar conducted the study under the Women Scientists Scheme by the department of science and technology of the central government. She has now been selected for the reputed S S Merh Award for the year 2014 by the Geological Society of India in recognition of her contribution to the field of quaternary geology.The geologist added that the existing records could not give an insight into the true nature of flooding in a river. ""The records beyond two decades are hardly available. For my study, I relied on paleoflood hydrology,"" she said.Sridhar said, ""Documentation of past flood events in a river basin is a critical method that provides information on large magnitude flooding over longer time periods than the instrumental records that are restricted to an average of 20 years.""She believes that her study will be instrumental in creating a long-term database of monsoon fluctuations in the rivers of Gujarat and can facilitate in modeling of future climate predictions.

By Keith Schneider

Circle of Blue

Ten months after a brutal flood killed thousands of people, leveled riverbank communities, and battered hydroelectric projects across the northern state of Uttarakhand in India‚Äôs Himalayan region, a panel of experts has concluded that hydropower development significantly amplified the damage.

The committee found that existing oversight practices do not adequately account for how significantly power dams affect the Himalayan gorges where they are being built, and called on India to overhaul its policies and practices for approving new hydropower projects. The 11-member committee recommended the cancellation of 23 hydroelectric projects proposed in Uttarakhand because of the ecological damage they would cause.

The report, ‚ÄòAssessment of Environmental Degradation and Impact of Hydroelectric Projects During the June 2013 Disaster in Uttarakhand‚Äô, was submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Forests on April 16, and made public on April 29. The expert panel was appointed in October 2013 at the direction of the Indian Supreme Court to determine whether Uttarakhand‚Äôs hydropower projects influenced the causes and consequences of the flooding that occurred on June 16 and June 17, 2013. Last summer, weeks after the flood, the Supreme Court also ordered a stay on construction and other activities to brng new hydropower projects on line in Uttarakhand.

‚ÄúIt is an honest report prepared by expert professionals wherein even the voices of dissent are recorded in a democratic way,‚Äù said Dr. Ravi Chopra, director of the People‚Äôs Science Institute, a non-profit public interest research organization based in Dehradun, Uttarkhand‚Äôs capital, and the committee‚Äôs chairman. ‚ÄúWe hope that the court will accept the report in its entirety with all its recommendations.‚Äù

The committee‚Äôs findings this week prompted a flurry of legal and political responses. The Court ordered work to stop on 23 of the 24 hydropower projects identified in Uttarakhand in a study two years ago for the Ministry of Environment and Forests. That study recommended cancelling those projects due to the excessive damage to rivers, fish, and land they would cause.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests, on May 7, asked the Supreme Court to appoint a new study committee on hydropower and the Uttarakhand flood. The Court responded that they needed more information from the Environment Ministry on why such an appointment was necessary.

Government Agencies Oppose Report Findings

The findings of Dr. Chopra‚Äôs committee also were condemned by the Central Electric Authority and the Central Water Commission, two influential energy development agencies that have helped lead India‚Äôs ambitious program to develop hydropower in Uttarakhand and four other Himalayan states.

The two agencies issued a joint report that criticized the methodology and science of the report and said ‚Äúhydro projects had no role in the Uttarakhand flash floods.‚Äù

The two agencies added that accepting the study commission‚Äôs findings would grievously hamper Indian hydropower development. India is counting on hydropower to produce 150,000 megawatts of electrical generating capacity ‚Äì comparable to 150 big coal-fired power plants. Only 40,000 megawatts of hydropower generating capacity exists in India today.

‚ÄúBlaming hydro projects for an unprecedented catastrophe and halting construction without any technical or scientific basis will seriously impact energy security,‚Äù the agencies said.

Since 2003, when India launched a national program to develop more megawatts of electrical generating capacity from hydropower, Uttarakhand has been the most active Indian state for building big and small hydro projects. Fifteen big hydropower projects have been commissioned in the state, 14 others are under construction. Some 39 projects, big and small, are proposed in just two river basins, the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi, according to the Central Electric Authority.

On June 16 and June 17, 2013, following days of torrential monsoon rains, a torrent of water, mud, and boulders roared down the narrow gorges of both river basins. More than 6,000 people died, according to the Indian government, though unofficial estimates put the death toll much higher. The damage to roads, buildings, water systems and hydroelectric infrastructure was so extensive much of it has still not been adequately repaired. The flood washed away 25 small hydro projects, and seriously damaged 10 big projects in both river basins.

Dams Amplify Damage

The Supreme Court-sanctioned study commission concluded that existing hydropower projects aggravated the damage. The major reasons, said the commission, were the mountains of silt, sand, and boulders that construction crews excavated to make room for at least 30 big and small hydropower projects, and left unmanaged along the riverbanks. The rushing high water scoured the banks, dissolved the mountains of construction spoils, and pushed the mud and boulders downstream, burying low lying communities.

Over the years, community leaders and environmental organizations have worried about the proximity of the spoils piles to Himalayan rivers, warning about the catastrophic consequences of a big flood. This study is the first official Indian government assessment to confirm that spoils piles are hazardous in high water.

‚ÄúThe damage was due to a combination of the quantity of flood water and the sediment loads carried by the rivers,‚Äù the report said.

The authors added, ‚ÄúMuck (sediment) management is a crucial issue. Current practices need to be reviewed and technically sound and ecologically sustainable ways of muck management in Uttarakhand have to be proposed to protect the people and the terrain from a June 2013 type of situation.‚Äù

The study commission also scrutinized and confirmed other serious risks from Himalayan hydropower construction. Such dams, said the commission, change river flows, damage fisheries, and can ruin riverine ecosystems. The panel also noted, as did a United Nations climate change study seven years ago, that ponds and lakes formed behind big dams are important sources of methane, a climate-changing air pollutant.

New Problems for India‚Äôs Energy Development

The committee recommended that India take a much more comprehensive approach to evaluating hydropower projects.

‚ÄúThe cumulative impact of multiple hydroelectric projects along the same river basin and the threat of a cascading chain of catastrophes in the case of structural failure or even from purely natural causes such as the floods of June 2013 suggest that there is an urgent need for a region or entire basin-based strategic environment assessment rather than individual project-oriented environmental impact assessments that neglect the summation effect,‚Äù said the report‚Äôs authors.

The committee‚Äôs report has raised new challenges for India‚Äôs hydropower development program, which has slowed dramatically in recent years. Many of the 23 projects that the committee recommended for permanent dismissal have already been awarded permits and developed contracts for construction with the Uttarakhand government. A senior executive at Jindal Power, a private hydro development company, told The Economic Times, an Indian daily newspaper, that the committee‚Äôs recommendations would significantly affect many companies, banks and ‚Äúthe nation‚Äôs dream of self-sufficiency.‚Äù

India‚Äôs insurance companies also are responding to the June 2013 flood. Insurers earlier this year raised the premium for hydropower plants across the Himalayas and other regions of the country. Companies like National Insurance Co. Ltd., United India Insurance Co Ltd., and Oriental Insurance Co. raised premium rates two to fourfold for hydroelectric projects after receiving huge damage claims from hydropower companies like NHPC and Jaiprakash Associates, which operate power plants in Uttarakhand that were seriously damaged by the floods.

‚ÄúLast year‚Äôs Uttarakhand tragedy completely changed the risk perception of hydro power plants for insurance companies. In response to tenders of power companies seeking quotation for re-insurance, insurers have asked for double or triple the earlier rates for power projects,‚Äù a senior power ministry official told Indian reporters.

Higher Insurance Rates a New Barrier to Hydro Development

An executive with National Insurance Co. said it was forced to hike premium rates because building and operating hydro projects in the Himalayas has become riskier. ‚ÄúThe projects get damaged every year during monsoons. But damage claims during last two years have risen sharply. Last year‚Äôs Uttarakhand episode has compelled us to change our assessment,‚Äù a company executive told reporters.

One of the projects, NHPC‚Äôs 280-megawatt Dhualiganga hydro station, suffered $US 50 million in damage when its turbines and other equipment in the project‚Äôs powerhouse were submerged by the flood. The company recovered a major chunk of the loss through insurance claims. Other hydropower projects sustained higher levels of damage.

The study commission‚Äôs report received generally high marks from the South Asia Network on Dams, River, and People, an Indian environmental organization. ‚ÄúThe lessons from Uttarakhand are relevant for all Himalayan states of India from Kashmir to all the North East states,‚Äù wrote Himanshu Thakkar, the group‚Äôs coordinator, on the SANDRP Web site. ‚ÄúWe hope the Supreme Court will ask the follow up committee to ensure that these lessons are taken note of, and necessary steps flowing from there are implemented in these Himalayan states. These will also provide guidance to our Himalayan neighboring countries.‚Äù

Malti and Bhagwati Devi are just two of the thousands of people who have had to abandon their homes to take shelter on an embankment in flood-affected Bihar‚Äôs Supaul district. Their main worry, however, is not hunger but the difficulties they face in going through their ablutions unlike men. ‚ÄúPoor women like us face more problems to relieve ourselves when floods force us to flee our villages. It is our fate. No one can imagine this except those like us,‚Äù said Bhagwati, in her late 30s, who along with her family have taken shelter on the eastern Kosi embankment.

Malti, in her early 50s and the mother of three young daughters, spoke of her ignominy. ‚ÄúWe have no option but to relieve ourselves in the open by closing our eyes and minds to the hell-like situation,‚Äù she said.

With major rivers including the Kosi, Gandak, Bagmati and Ganga rising and posing a serious threat, Malti and Bhagwati are two of thousands of women in flood‚Äîaffected districts in the state living with shame and fighting to relieve themselves. ‚ÄúFlood-hit poor women face more problems than men as more than for food, they have to fight shame and shock to relieve themselves either on the crowded embankment or nearby. There is no other place as there is life‚Äîthreatening water all around,‚Äù said Ranjeev, a flood expert who works in the Kosi region.

Mahender Yadav, an activist working in the same regiion, told IANS: ‚ÄúIt is beyond imagination how women trapped by the rising rivers go through their ablutions.‚Äù

A much sought‚Äîafter item by these women is polythene sheets or bags with which they can wrap around themselves and stand in the water to relieve themselves. ‚ÄúEven polythene sheets are in short supply as the authorities have failed to provide them,‚Äù Mr. Yadav said.

Ranjeev said neither the men of their families nor the government pay proper attention to this big problem of women in the flood‚Äîhit district.

He said that there is no plan to erect makeshift toilets on the embankments for women. ‚ÄúA few years ago, a British woman researcher was with me on a visit to an embankment during floods. She was stunned to know that women have been forced to relieve themselves in the open as there was no arrangement made for them,‚Äù Ranjeev recalled.

It is over 10 days that rivers continued to flow above the danger mark in Saharsa, Supaul, Madhepura, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Khagaria, Sitamarhi, Nalanda and other districts, affecting 1.6 million people in more than 850 villages.

Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, after an aerial survey of the flood‚Äîaffected 15 districts last week said the situation is grim but under control. He ordered the district officials to provide relief and rescue on a priority basis to people living in inundated areas.

The floods have so far claimed 17 lives in the state.

The state government has evacuated 116,000 people till date from flooded areas and around 50,000 people have taken shelter in 133 relief camps set up by the government at different places. The government had earlier sounded a high alert as the water level of major rivers in north Bihar rose following heavy rain in their catchment areas in Nepal.

SRINAGAR

Two days after US government announced $250,000 (Rs 1.5 crore) aid for flood victims of Jammu and Kashmir, US business tycoon Bill Gates announced $700,000 (Rs 4.25 crore) aid as a relief package for the flood-ravaged state.

A prominent philanthropistl Gates (co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) extended ‚Äúdeepest sympathies‚Äù to the flood affected people of the state.

Earlier, Charge d‚ÄôAffaires Ambassador Kathleen Stephens announced that the US intends to provide USD 250,000 to select NGOs through the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in response to the needs of the people affected by the disaster.

Besides US, the UAE government Wednesday announced that ‚Äúit would send urgent humanitarian assistance to the flood victims in Jammu and Kashmir‚Äù. Australia too had provided Rs 15 lakh for the victims of flood-ravaged Jammu and Kashmir.

The worst floods have left around 280 people dead so far and 2300 villages damaged across the state. And to help out relief victims, the foreign countries have been announcing aid for the flood-ravaged state.

But after New Delhi‚Äôs tacit refusal to solicit help from the United Nations, foreign aid seemingly got stalled before the state government Friday said it would ask the centre to waive customs duty on relief material. ‚ÄúI will take up the matter with the centre,‚Äù chief minister Omar Abdullah said.

New Delhi‚Äôs resistance against foreign aid drew flak back in valley with the civil society group, Kashmir Centre for Social and Development Studies (KCDS), saying that if international aid was availed at the time of natural calamities in Bhuj, Orissa and Latur, why is the government hesitant to seek it for helping the flood-affected victims in Kashmir. ‚ÄúAt the time of earthquake in Pakistan administered Kashmir, international aid flew from US, Turkey, Italy and China. Why is India reluctant to accept it for Kashmir? We feel it is a deliberate move to increase the hardships of Kashmiris,‚Äù the KCDS said in a statement.

Even Hurriyat Conference (M) chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq asked New Delhi ‚Äúto rise above politics and on humanitarian grounds allow international aid agencies to reach out to the flood-hit people‚Äù.

On the first day of the floods, said Hurriyat Conference (G) chairman Syed Ali Geelani, we appealed to the international community including United Nations, UNICEF, OIC and other Muslim countries for urgent relief. ‚ÄúWe got a positive and warm response and many people outside were more than eager to send relief,‚Äù Geelani said in a statement, ‚Äúbut arrogant and biased Indian establishment did not allow that aid to reach us, thereby proving that they always wanted us to be treated as their own slaves.‚Äù",,2014 Kashmir floods,"Jammu and Kashmir, India",15-Sep-14,02-Oct-14,2300 villages,300 mm,Rs 4.25 crore,280,destruction of infrastructure and homes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"$700,000 (Rs 4.25 crore) from Bill Gates",Severe

delhi,2014,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jun/16/nepal-climate-change-economic-research,16-Jun-14,Flooding in Nepal: will the economy survive the deluge?,"In Banke district along the West Rapti river basin in Nepal, farmers have noticed that floods are coming more often, and with greater intensity. Flooding has always been part of the annual cycle of life, but the past 40 years have seen 12 abnormally large floods that have eroded land and wiped out crops and buildings. Each major flood costs the average household the equivalent of $9,000 (¬£5,200).

In Nepal, where the average household annual income in 2011 was $2,700, these floods are a huge financial burden.

This story is replicated across Nepal. Between 1983 and 2010, every year floods have, on average, resulted in 283 deaths, 8,000 homes destroyed and 29,000 families affected, and dented Nepal's economy as a whole.

A recent study by the Nepali government and the Climate Development Knowledge Network (CDKN) has quantified the economic impact of these floods and other risk areas for today, and in the future. The study found that when both direct costs to infrastructure, as well as health and welfare impacts are considered, the total annual costs of these floods is, on average, $232m per year.

And the situation is expected to worsen. The climate in Nepal is already changing, with higher temperatures and more erratic rainfall patterns. The study, which used downscaled climate model simulation projections for Nepal, anticipates temperature increases of 3-5C by the end of the century.

The government's ambitious targets for economic growth, including graduating from least-developed to developed country status by 2022, is at serious risk, according to the study's findings. The agriculture and hydroelectricity sector are two of the major drivers of economic growth in Nepal, both of which will be significantly affected by climate change in the future.

Around three-quarters of Nepal's population relies on agriculture for income, and it contributes a third of the country's GDP. By the 2070s, climate change is projected to lead to a net decrease in crop productivity with resulting high economic costs that are estimated at $140m a year.

Hydroelectric plants provide roughly 90% of total electricity in the country and are expected to be a key driver for achieving Nepal's economic growth targets. The government's 2030 Development Vision anticipates a structural shift in the economy away from agriculture towards electricity, gas and water, with hydropower exports being a critical sector. However, ""run-of-river"" plants, which are the most common type in Nepal, rely on predictable rainfall and river flows.

The study has calculated that the additional stress of climate change on hydroelectricity production is already costing the equivalent of 0.1% of GDP per year on average, and 0.3% in very dry years. Together with floods and the impact on agriculture, these three risk areas could cost Nepal the equivalent of 2-3% of current GDP a year by mid-century.

However, it is possible to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and prevent this loss of economic growth. Banke district residents have tried to adapt to the increased flooding. Those who can afford it have reinforced the foundations of their homes or raised them on plinths. Some have changed their farming patterns to grow crops that better withstand the water. But for many, if the situation continues to worsen, they will lose the ability to cope with the impacts of the floods. Some residents are already considering migrating from the area.

These adaptation actions also come with associated costs. A significant increase in investment beyond that forecast by the government is needed in these sectors to reduce the impacts of climate change. The study projected additional investment required between now and 2030 to mainstream adaptation into planned development activities. This came to an additional $500m in the hydroelectricity sector, $1.7bn in the agriculture sector and $209m for tackling water-induced disasters.

So then comes the crux of one of the key international debates ‚Äì who should pay for the impact of climate change? Certainly the private sector will play a role, particularly for agriculture and electricity production. For example, there is a business case for a commercial farmer to invest in irrigation to ensure higher yields when rainfall becomes more erratic. But a significant burden will still fall on the Nepal government, which will also need to draw on international support.

Fortunately, in making the case for increased levels of international climate finance, the government now has the economic data to make a strong argument. Significant investment will be needed for adaptation and to prevent the stalling of economic growth in the country.

For those in Banke district who are uncertain of what the near future holds, questions about who is responsible and who should pay seem far away. It is learning how to survive and adapt that is the immediate concern.

(Amit Mehra) Girl who fought off molesters, boy who rescued two from burning van will also be given the President‚Äôs National Bravery Award on January 24. (Amit Mehra)

June 16, 2013. It‚Äôs a day etched in nine-year-old Mahika‚Äôs memory. ‚ÄúOne instant, I was with my family, praying at the Kedarnath temple, and the next, all I could see was water. No family, no relatives, just lots of water,‚Äù she said.

Suddenly she heard her four-year-old brother crying. ‚ÄúI knew he was in the water and in pain, and that I had to find him.‚Äù Without knowing how to swim, and braving the floating debris coming her way, she found her brother and dragged him to safety. ‚ÄúAnd there she waited, without food and water, just clutching her brother tightly, till I found her three days later,‚Äù Renu Gupta, Mahika‚Äôs mother, said.

A student of Presentation Convent School, Delhi, Mahika, is one of the 25 children who will be receiving the President‚Äôs National Bravery Award on January 24. Mahika will be conferred the highest honour ‚Äî the Bharat Award.

The National Bravery Awards, initiated by the Indian Council for Child Welfare, give recognition to children who distinguish themselves by performing outstanding acts of bravery. This year, the 25 children include nine girls and 16 boys, five of the whom will be awarded posthumously.

Shubham Santosh (17) is another student who will receive the award. Last year, Santosh risked his life to rescue two girls from a burning van.

A resident of Jalgaon, Maharashtra, Santosh was returning home from school, when he saw a van on fire. As the crowd watched helplessly, Santosh unlocked the van‚Äôs door from the inside, and pulled out the girls.

‚ÄúNobody else was coming forward to help, and I couldn‚Äôt let those girls burn,‚Äù he said.

When passers-by didn‚Äôt respond to a 15-year-old girl‚Äôs cries for help, she fought off molesters on her own. ‚ÄúWhen I resisted their attempts to put me inside the van, they started beating me. Pretending to be hurt, I threatened them with the pen-knife in my bag. Before they knew what was happening, I managed to run away,‚Äù she said.

For displaying grit, determination and fighting off molesters, the girl will get the prestigious Geeta Chopra Award.

Shilpa Sharma (14) from Badang, Himachal Pradesh, will also be awarded for fighting off a leopard to save her brother‚Äôs life. ‚ÄúIt is not about size or strength or being afraid. It‚Äôs about reacting in the moment, and saving what you hold dear. I didn‚Äôt do it for an award, I did it for Anshul (her brother). And I‚Äôll do it again if I have to,‚Äù she said.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

New Delhi: One year ago, flash floods rocked Kedarnath, in which thousands of people lost their lives and left the state infrastructure in tatters.

As Uttarakhand marks the first anniversary of the devastating floods, thousands of survivors continue to struggle, hoping the government will eventually come good on its promise to provide jobs and new homes.The memory of last year's devastating flashfloods surfaced after around 30 skeletons were recovered from a forest near Kedarnath temple The flash floods had led to Mandakini River changing its original course, which got blocked by 15 metre high debris, and merging with Sarswati River in the south.The temple premises, which was covered with the debris resulting from the flash floods, has been cleared and the administration is making arrangements to safeguard the temple from such a crisis in future.Also Read:While work is on to reconstruct the region, fear hangs heavy in the air. Slow progress of reconstruction isn't helping to counter the perception that Kedarnath is unsafe. It clouds the minds of locals and tourists alike.But despite fears and the difficulties, many pilgrims, driven by faith have made the arduous journey to the Kedarnath shrine this year as well. Most devotees make a night halt at the shrine before trekking back the next day.The locals are trying to ensure a smooth yatra for the pilgrims. Voluntary groups are providing free food and make-shift tents in the absence of pucca structures.But the locals are hopeful that such a tragedy, which is very rare, will not happen again in their lifetime.In June 2013, a cloud burst had led to incessant rains over Gandhi Sarovar causing landslides which further resulted into deluge from the Mandakini River.The flash floods washed away countless villages, roads and bridges dealing a fatal blow to tourism, the mainstay of the hill state's economy.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

As many as 550 people were shifted to this school from different parts of of Sayajigunj and Parsorambhatta. ‚ÄúWe have lost all our belongings and it will take a long time to pick up the pieces to get back to a normal life,‚Äô‚Äô said Ranjanaben Solanki.



Meanwhile, in the Kamtaipura area, it was some volunteers from nearby areas who were reaching out to the flood affected. ‚ÄúWe cannot keep waiting in hope for relief material to arrive, so we have opened a community kitchen and serving people from here, as there are scores of children who have been going without food,‚Äô‚Äô said Mansur Khan, one of the volunteers.



The last time Vadodara had witnessed such floods was 12 years ago, when water was released into Vishwamitri. With schools and colleges remaining shut on Wednedsay, the district administration has asked educational institutes and business establishments to shut doors on Thursday. People have been asked to keep a stock of essential food items.

Sacred portals of the Kedarnath temple were reopened to devotees amid elaborate rituals early this morning, about a year after the Himalayan shrine was marred by flash floods that had left hundreds of people dead and many others stranded.Chief priest of the shrine (Rawal) Bhima Shankar Ling presided over the rituals as its gates were opened amid chanting of vedic hymns, Badrinath-Kedarnath temple committee CEO V D Singh told PTI over phone.About 1,252 devotees including eight foreign nationals visited the shrine on the opening day, he said.

It is the first 'Char Dham' yatra after last year's calamity.The annual pilgrimage was struck by the unprecedented flash floods last year causing large scale loss of lives and property. Over 5,000 people are dead or missing, including pilgrims from various parts of the country.Expressing happiness over the first day turnout, Mr Singh said it was much more than their expectations.""The crowd was bigger than expected and there was much enthusiasm among the devotees. It is an indication that the fear psychosis gripping people outside the state in the wake of last year's tragedy is subsiding gradually.""The crowd of visitors is likely to swell as the snow begins to melt,"" he said.Arrangements for a round-the-clock langar have been made by the temple committee near the shrine to cater to visitors.Makeshift tents have been pitched at several places en route to the temple to accommodate more than a thousand people.There are enough food supplies available, he said.However, Pandit Jasraj, who was to perform live at the shrine on its opening day, could not come, he said.Tourism and Culture Secretary Umakant Panwar said the Indian classical vocalist had to cancel his programme yesterday as it was unsafe for him to fly in a chopper to the high altitude shrine which is still clogged with snow.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

""I am sure the project costing Rs 2,200 crore will be sanctioned by the Government of India,"" state chief secretary Mohammad Iqbal Khandey told reporters in Srinagar.

He said the project for construction of a second flood spill channel from Sangam in Anantnag district in south Kashmir to Wullar Lake in Bandipora district in north Kashmir was submitted to the Centre in 2007 and Rs 97 crore were released in 2010.

""There were some arguments back and forth but the project has not yet been sanctioned,"" he said.

Khandey said the Kashmir floods will be a classic case for study to prevent urban floods.

Secretary, flood control department, Pawan Kotwal said the proposed second flood spill channel has the capacity to hold 1,20,000 cusec water that Jhelum river carried on 6 September which inundated large parts of the Valley.

""It is essential for the whole Valley to have a flood management project,"" Kotwal said, even as he admitted that encroachments on the banks of the river and illegal constructions were also responsible for the floods.

The official said the funds released by the Centre were used for dredging the existing flood channel, which enhanced its capacity by 9,000 cusec.

""We have also carried out dredging in River Jhelum downstream at Baramulla, increasing the capacity of the river there to 30,000 cusec. This saved the Baramulla town and surrounding areas from getting inundated,"" he said.

Kotwal said the department has sought help from National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) experts to study the cause of sudden rise for water level in river Jhelum.

""We have requested for satellite image data for studying the reasons for the rise of water level,"" he said.

Kotwal said the floods in Kashmir were the worst since 1902.

""The Valley was submerged for two months while Srinagar city was marooned for seven months. That year Jhelum was carrying 104,000 cusec of water.""

The official said the department will also study the effects of the railway track and construction of national highway through the Valley on the flow of flood water.

""Railway and highway prevented the spread of flood water. We will study all this,"" he said.

New Delhi: Union minister Jitendra Singh today received a cheque of Rs 10 lakh for flood relief in Jammu and Kashmir from Repatriates Cooperative Finance & Development Bank Ltd.

REPCO Bank is promoted by Ministry of Home Affairs in association with the governments of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.

The main objective of the bank is rehabilitation of repatriates mainly from Sri Lanka and Burma. It has now also begun undertaking diverse activities to offer services other than repatriates.

‚ÄúThe amount of Rs 10 lakh donated by the Bank is a part of the Corporate Social Reforms (CSR) activities,‚Äù an official press release issued today said.

Appreciating the gesture, Jitendra Singh said, it should be a matter of great satisfaction for the flood-hit people of JK and at the same time, an inspiration for philanthropists and social-minded agencies across the country to donate generously for rebuilding and reconstruction of the damages caused by the floods.

Singh, Minister of State for Prime Minister's Office, said that with the support of the central government, Army and paramilitary forces, the flood rescue and relief operations were carried out without any waste of time, which helped in minimising the losses.

Environmentalists say last year's devastating flash floods in Uttarakhand, in which at least 5,000 were killed, and the unprecedented deluge in Jammu and Kashmir this year, both have the same cause - urbanization, reduced forest cover and erratic monsoon.Authorities in both states ignored warnings from weathermen, magnifying a disaster waiting to happen.At least 150 have been killed in Jammu and Kashmir, where large parts have been submerged, and tens of thousands are waiting to be rescued.

The meteorological department says it had issued warnings about very heavy rainfall in Jammu and Kashmir practically every day since September 2. But while a few families did move to higher regions, the state government seems to have failed to anticipate the extent of the crisis and effectively convince those who stayed back.The situations in Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir are uncannily similar, experts say. In both cases the trigger was incessant rain, set off by the merging of the western disturbance and the monsoon.In Uttarakhand, the devastation was worse because of deforestation, and construction on the river bed. Houses were built either on or dangerously close to the river banks, which raised the human cost of the disaster. ""It is a similar pattern in parts of J&K also,"" said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment.Monsoon in India has always been tough to predict. And some scientists say that rainfall patterns are getting frequently more erratic. In Srinagar, the average rainfall for September 5 is 0.4 mm. But this year's figure was 49mm - 122 times more.""These events of intense rainfall have been increasing and we will have to learn how to adapt to them. Part of that process is ensuring that we build wisely and in safe areas,"" adds Mr Bhushan.The other form of caution is to pay close attention to weather forecasts and act on time.

delhi,2014,https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/waters-close-kashmir,23-Sep-14,Waters Close Over Kashmir,"On the evening of September 7th, I was trying to reach my family in Srinagar, the largest city in India-controlled Kashmir. Automated messages thwarted me: ‚ÄúThis number is out of coverage area‚Äù; ‚ÄúThe number you have called is not available.‚Äù At a certain point in the night, my father willed a call across the Himalayas. ‚ÄúWe are home,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt is all right here.‚Äù His voice belied his words. I wanted to check if he had the medicine he needed for his heart condition, but the call dropped.

It had rained nonstop for the past week, and the Jhelum river, which spools like a paisley through the valley of Kashmir before crossing over to Pakistan, in the north, had been swelling. For stretches, on its way to Srinagar, the Jhelum runs parallel to the lone highway from the Indian plains to the valley. By September 5th, the river and its tributaries had inundated hundreds of villages‚Äîmodest homes destroyed, apple orchards sundered, and fields of saffron and rice wasted.

Waters would soon close over Srinagar. There had already been a surge in a canal linked to the Jhelum, flooding parts of the city where more than a million people live. My family had sandbagged the entrance to our house and moved everything‚Äîbooks, television, carpets, sofas, clothes, and kitchenware‚Äîto an upper floor. A little later, the Jhelum ripped through the embankments in Srinagar; water rose up to twenty feet. The city began drowning. The telephone networks crashed. The lights went off. Hundreds of thousands of stranded people needed rescue, food, and medicine.

On September 10th, I flew home, to Kashmir, from Delhi with my childhood friend Jabeer Ahmad; the airlines did not charge us for the boxes of medicines and food supplies we carried. Ahmad, who works in advertising, walked through the airport with drooped shoulders. A tall, athletic man, he seemed in a daze. His uncle, who raised him, was stranded with his wife and two children in their third-floor apartment, in central Srinagar. His uncle had managed to use WhatsApp to send Ahmad a photograph of a house across the street, flooded up to the second floor. ‚ÄúWe have to find a boat and get them out,‚Äù he told me.

Anxious faces filled the plane. The brown and blue peaks of the Himalayas‚Äîthe marker of where home ended and the world began‚Äîcircling the bowl-shaped valley of Kashmir, rose through the clouds. As we descended, I craned my neck for a glimpse of the ground and saw a stream swollen with furious brown water.

At the Srinagar airport, a few hundred men from the Indian state of Bihar, who had worked in construction and as house painters, squatted on the sidewalks, holding onto bundles that they had salvaged from their flooded accommodations. Rizwan Alam, a twenty-six-year-old house painter from Bihar told me, ‚ÄúI have been here for four days. Some person or another gives us food.‚Äù The Indian government had announced free air tickets to evacuate the stranded workers and tourists. Alam was waiting for his turn.

Calamities twist and tear our personal geographies. My parents live a short drive from the airport, but the familiar road had drowned. Young men waved twigs of willow branches to direct traffic to back lanes, through neighborhoods I rarely visited. I drove through knee-high water to our house. I rang the bell and waited for a long moment.

My father opened the gate. He looked haggard, older than his sixty-three years. He was limping; his right toe was bandaged and his foot had swollen blue. After our last phone conversation, water had roared into the neighborhood. He had watched shoes, clothes, and furniture be carried away by the current. While preparing to leave the house, he had slipped and cut himself. Hundreds of people, including my father and my aunt and her two young daughters, had passed a night huddled together on the top floor of a shopping complex a mile away. They spent two days at the house of a friend who lived in a drier area. ‚ÄúWe came back in the morning,‚Äù he told me. My mother was stranded with my grandparents in her ancestral village, a few hours away.

Later, I met Ahmad and his uncle Mohiuddin at a crossroad. Mohiuddin, a soft-spoken man with a Hemingway moustache who writes a little poetry, had been rescued by a paramilitary force known as the National Disaster Response Force. He stepped out of a friend‚Äôs car in a faded shirt, with several days‚Äô worth of stubble. ‚ÄúNobody heard us, nobody paid any attention for four days,‚Äù he said. His voice was angry but calm, as if he was simply too tired to rant.

He had sat through the dark, fear-filled nights, punctuated by the thuds of houses collapsing underwater. Between dawn and dusk, he peered out of a window onto the main street, calling for help. Rescue boats manned by police and military men glided below his second-floor window, but none stopped. ‚ÄúThey came to rescue important people,‚Äù he said. Mohiuddin texted every official he knew for help; the sole reply advised him not to expect any help.

The failure of the government was visible throughout the city. As the water rushed in, Omar Abdullah, the chief minister of India-controlled Kashmir, tweeted, ‚ÄúThis is an unprecedented situation & we are doing the best we can under the circumstances. Please don‚Äôt panic, we will reach you, I promise.‚Äù More than a week later, I failed to see a policeman from his government on the streets of the city. (He is better known for his time on Twitter than for his governance.) I did see, as I drove on the littered road leading to the city center, some Indian soldiers in rescue boats parked by alleys leading from a high embankment, along a flood channel, to a few upper-middle-class neighborhoods. Thousands of houses between the embankment and the Jhelum, a few miles north, were submerged. On the embankment itself, near the roof of a van poking out of the water, residents had set up common kitchens; men and women, their clothes grimy, cooked in enormous copper pots over wood fires.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
delhi,2014,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/sep/19/floods-india-pakistan-chance-peace-building,19-Sep-14,Floods in India and Pakistan offer a chance for peace-building,"South Asia‚Äôs rivers are again in furious flow with India‚Äôs northern state of Kashmir hit by the worst floods in 50 years. Its capital, Srinagar, has been overwhelmed by the deluge, with road links to the rest of India washed away and villagers marooned on rooftops. India‚Äôs prime minister, Narendra Modi, has declared a national disaster. However, with crops and livestock under water, a state that was re-emerging from years of conflict has suffered a cruel setback.

On the Pakistani side, the flooding has been equally devastating with more than 300 dead, 2.3 million people affected and rural livelihoods decimated as cotton fields are intentionally flooded to save cities.

We have been here before. Only four years ago an epic flood engulfed large swaths of Pakistan, displacing 20 million people across the country, leading the UN to describe it as the worst humanitarian disaster of its time.

In response to the 2010 floods, a younger generation of Indian and Pakistani leaders joined hands and created a platform to foster bilateral cooperation on shared risks and vulnerabilities. Chief among these was climate change and its manifestation in extreme weather events such as the floods, which the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) attributed to climate change.

The efforts of these young Indians and Pakistanis led to meetings in Lahore, Delhi and Davos, starting a conversation around the climate risk faced by both countries and challenging politicians to unite around the shared necessity of climate action.

Action is now needed more than ever. Climate change is both a challenge as well as an opportunity for these two nuclear nations. It is a risk that can no longer be ignored, and has to be managed.

How to deal with the shared resource of its river waters and what to do when they break their banks in an era of climate change is a key challenge for both India and Pakistan. At the upstream end this will require improved bilateral cooperation on transboundary water management in the Indus river basin. At the downstream end this will need shared expertise and collaboration on improving disaster-risk management.

As this month has shown, cataclysmic floods present a real danger to both countries. Both have been ravaged by intense and unseasonable rainfall in the Indus river basin. On 2 September, Kashmir was hit by more than 200mm of rain in less than 24 hours ‚Äì four times the average monthly rainfall. Yet the state does not have a single flood forecasting station or a disaster management department. As we saw with Pakistan in 2010, this was a disaster waiting to happen.

In its fifth assessment report the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has strengthened its assessment that extreme rainfall will be a feature of climate change as weather patterns shift across south Asia.

While we may not be able to predict when disaster strikes, one can plan for it better and prepare accordingly. Given the shared nature of the problem, efforts at a solution too must be shared. This was the message from India and Pakistan‚Äôs young leaders in Lahore two years ago. Today it is more resonant than ever.

History is not an encouraging guide. The closest south Asia has come to a joint environmental monitoring system for floods is with the WMO-led initiative, the Hindu Kush-Himalaya hydrological cycle observation system. The project has established a regional flood information system to facilitate exchange of hydrometerological data to mitigate casualties and property damage among member countries. These initiatives are vital, but their limitations have been demonstrated by the drama unfolding in India and Pakistan.

With new prime ministers at the helm in both countries, there is a unique opportunity to exercise leadership. Both Modi and Nawaz Sharif are from border states and have shown remarkable willingness to engage in peace-building, despite persistent acrimony from their armed forces.

Acknowledging that the deadly floods are not an act of god but a symptom of climate change would be a first step towards acknowledging a common vulnerability.

delhi,2014,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/24-city-students-feared-washed-away-in-hp/article6095255.ece,09-Jun-14,24 city students feared washed away in HP,"June 09, 2014 12:40 am | Updated November 17, 2021 04:27 am IST - SHIMLA/HYDERABAD:

At least 24 engineering college students from Hyderabad were feared washed away in river Beas in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh late on Sunday evening.

The students were reportedly washed away by the flash floods that occurred in the river after water was released from the upstream Larji Hydro electric project. The engineering students who had entered the river bank on the Mandi-Manali highway were apparently taking photographs at Thalot.

The sudden surge of water swept away at least 18 boys and 6 girls of VNR Institute of Engineering and Technology catching them completely unaware. The college is located in Bachupally on the outskirts of Hyderabad.

There were 61 tourists, including 48 students of the engineering college, who were travelling to the hill station of Manali. Out of 24 missing students, 6 were girls, police said.

The local administration said the gates at Pandoh dam in Mandi, about 15 kms downstream, have been shut to fish out the bodies. The vehicular traffic on the busy Mandi-Manali highway has also been closed to conduct the rescue operations.

The students were on an industrial tour and left Hyderabad on June 3. One of the students, Pratyusha who saved herself said that they were on their way to Kullu from Shimla and they were taking pictures on the river bed. Some students went a bit deep into the waters and they couldn‚Äôt rush back as the gushing waters swept them away.

‚ÄúThe project officials had sounded an alert but we did not hear it,‚Äù she said sobbing uncontrollably seeking the help of the media to bring them back. ‚ÄúThere has been no assistance so far from the HP authorities except for the police grilling us about the number of students,‚Äù she lamented.

Andhra Pradesh Resident Commissioner Shashank Goel said that information given by the Mandi Deputy Commissioner Dwesh Kumar said: ‚ÄúThe Deputy Commissioner has not confirmed any casualties.‚Äù

Himachal Pradesh officials said that the students who were feared washed away could surface in Pandoh dam, which is 15 kms downstream of the site of the tragedy. ‚ÄúHimachal Pradesh officials have requisitioned the services of divers and rafts to take up relief and rescue operations,‚Äù Mr. Goel said adding that a two-member team of AP Bhavan ‚Äì P.Ravin Shankar (Assistant Commissioner) and M. V. S. Rama Rao (Protocol Officer) are leaving by the first flight to Kullu, which has an airport.

The tamarind tree here that offered sanctuary and saved more than 150 lives during the Musi floods of 1908, would be protected and the past glory of its immediate environs at Afzal Park would be revived, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) Commissioner Somesh Kumar said here on Sunday.

At a meeting organised under the same saviour tree by Centre for Deccan Studies (CDS) and Forum For Better Hyderabad (FBH) to pay homage to the 1908 Musi flood victims, Mr. Somesh Kumar said experts would be roped to restore and maintain the historic tree. The availability of money was not an issue for the civic body, he said.

Responding to pleas to save the Musi, Mr. Somesh Kumar said the task involved departments such as revenue, water board, irrigation and also active involvement on part of the local populace.

‚ÄúTransforming Musi into a live river and restoring its old glory is a herculean task. However, it can be done and I am hopeful we will do it,‚Äù he said.

Towards protecting the city‚Äôs heritage, the GHMC has been actively pursuing various works, including the Charminar Pedestrianisation Project and restoration works at the Quli Qutub Shahi Tombs, he said, adding that incentives for protection of heritage structures were also under consideration and orders could be expected soon.

‚ÄúAt least five to six monuments of Hyderabad should be on the UNESCO list but there are none. We need commitment to preserve heritage and maintain them,‚Äù the GHMC Commissioner added.

CDS secretary Sajjad Shahid recounted the accounts of havoc caused by the 1908 floods and said the ravaging Musi swept through colonies, destroyed properties and affected thousands of people.

‚ÄúHyderabad showed remarkable resilience and rebuilt,‚Äù he said, adding that more than 100 years later, the city was still facing similar problems. Mr. Shahid said the tamarind tree needed to be recognised, protected and respected.

FBH president M. Vedakumar called for steps to address issues related to dumping of pollutants and garbage and encroachments to save the Musi.

Almost 300 big hydropower projects are under construction or proposed for India‚Äôs five Himalayan states, according to the Central Electric Authority.

‚ÄúThe government wants to put dams on every river in the Himalayas‚Äù

The most turbulent stretches of many Himalayan rivers are scheduled to support five or six new dams, one every 10 kilometers or so. That‚Äôs more utility-scale installations than are planned for the world‚Äôs other new hydropower production zones ‚Äì the Rocky Mountains in British Columbia, the Amazon Basin, and the Andes mountains, according to assessments by power authorities in those regions.

‚ÄúThe government wants to put dams on every river in the Himalayas,‚Äù said Prakash Nautiyal, a fisheries biologist and for decades a professor of zoology at the Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in this Alaknanda River city of 150,000 residents. ‚ÄúYou know the car culture of Delhi and Mumbai? Bumper to bumper. That‚Äôs what they want to do in the Himalayas with dams. Bumper to bumper.‚Äù



The Himalayas are still forming, still rising ‚Äì producing one of the most active earthquake zones in the world. The fierce drenchings from annual summer monsoons erupt in regular flash floods that undermine the soils of vertical slopes, cause monstrous landslides, and episodically lay waste to big stretches of the region‚Äôs serpentine one-way-in, one-way-out highways. In a typical year, dozens of people drown, are buried, or swept away by floods in India‚Äôs Himalayan states.

Technically Complex and Hazardous Challenge

The unavoidable challenge that India‚Äôs engineers and contractors recognized but largely ignored, according to a flurry of government and university studies dating to the early 1990s, was whether the truculent mountain range would accept such intensive industrial intrusion. Late last spring, at the start of the heaviest monsoon season in memory, the Himalayas answered that question.

On June 16 and June 17, 2013, the mountains unleashed two days of monstrous floods that killed about 6,000 people, according to estimates from the Uttarakhand government. Survivors and researchers at the Wadia Institute for Himalayan Geology put the death toll at 30,000. Some 800 battered bodies were recovered and 5,200 others were declared missing.

The flooding wiped away at least six villages, buried dozens of others in mud, wrecked over 1,000 kilometers of highways, and dumped hundreds of buildings into the furious waters.

Flood‚Äôs Effects on Dam Construction

The June flood also may have drowned India‚Äôs long campaign to diversify its energy production with big Himalayan hydropower projects.

In the first of three articles for ‚ÄúChoke Point: India,‚Äù an investigation of global energy, water, and farm production trends conducted in collaboration with the Wilson Center, Circle of Blue documents that the flood seriously damaged at least 10 big hydro projects in operation and under construction in Uttarakhand. Another 19 small hydropower projects that generate under 25 megawatts were destroyed.

The findings are based on Circle of Blue‚Äôs field reporting in December and January, state and national media dispatches, independent news services, and trade journal notices. We were assisted by the South Asia Network on Dams and Rivers, a non-profit advocacy group, and reports posted on Down to Earth, an online New Delhi-based environmental news site affiliated with the Center for Science and Environment.

The Central and state government authorities, and private dam developers, have said next to nothing about the extent of the damage in news releases, on their web sites, or in public statements. Repeated efforts by Circle of Blue to reach business executives and government regulators by email and phone calls were ignored. The information blackout is so sweeping that even the website of the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, the state-owned hydropower builder and operator, had until recently been offline for months.

The most heavily damaged projects, according to Circle of Blue‚Äôs findings, include:

The 400-megawatt Vishnuprayag Hydroelectric Project, upriver from Srinagar along the Alaknanda River, was buried beneath 20 meters of rubble that also filled its water storage lake and likely wrecked the mouth of the penstock, the pipe that transports water to the powerhouse downstream.

A second dam under construction on the Mandakini River, the 76-megawatt Phata-Byung Hydroelectric Project, washed away.

The 400-megawatt Vishnuprayag Hydroelectric Project was buried beneath 20 meters of rubble The 99-megawatt Singoli-Bhatwari Hydroelectric Project downstream on the Mandakini, a major tributary of the Alaknanda, was so aggressively pummeled by boulders that big chunks of concrete were gouged out of its base and the patches of steel reinforcing rods of two support towers were bent like broken wheat.

The powerhouse and turbines of the 330-megawatt Alaknanda Hydro Power Project in Srinagar were inundated with mud and silt just weeks before it was scheduled to begin operating.

A landslide blocked the end of the water discharge tunnel at the 280-megawatt Dhauliganga project near the border with Nepal. The plug caused a backup that submerged the entire turbine room constructed deep inside the hill near the dam, causing at least $50 million in damage and a shutdown that has still not ended, said dam operators.

The Uttarakhand flood surprised India with its fury. Energy authorities in Asia and in North America have said the flood caused the most damage to a nation‚Äôs hydropower infrastructure since 1975, when rains from a typhoon overwhelmed the Banqiao Dam and 61 smaller dams in central China, killing 171,000 people.

In the history of energy disasters, the Uttarakhand flood struck the global hydropower industry with the same force that the reactor meltdowns at Three Mile Island (U.S. 1979), Chernobyl (Soviet Union, 1986), and Fukushima (Japan, 2011) battered the nuclear power sector.

‚ÄúThe disaster is a costly wake-up call,‚Äù said Peter Bosshard, the policy director at International Rivers, a California-based non-profit research and river protection group that primarily operates in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. ‚ÄúIt shows that nature will strike back if we disregard the ecological limits of fragile regions like the Himalayas through reckless dam building and other infrastructure development. We can only expect such disasters to happen more frequently under a changing climate.‚Äù

Court Intervention

India‚Äôs Supreme Court reached essentially the same conclusion. Last August 13, eight weeks after the flood, two Supreme Court judges, ruling in a case involving the 330-megawatt Alaknanda Hydro Power Project, issued an order that indefinitely prohibited the Central and state governments from granting any more permits for hydroelectric projects in Uttarakhand. The order essentially shut down new hydropower development in India‚Äôs 27th state.

Produced by the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers, and People

‚ÄúWe are very much concerned about the mushrooming of a large number of hydroelectric projects in Uttarakhand and its impact on the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi river basins,‚Äù wrote Justices K.S. Radhakrishnan and Dipak Misra. ‚ÄúVarious studies also indicate that in the upper Ganga area, there are large and small hydropower projects. The cumulative impact of those project components like dams, tunnels, blasting, muck disposal, mining, deforestation, etc. on the ecosystem has yet to be scientifically examined.‚Äù

The Supreme Court‚Äôs intervention also came with a directive to the Ministry of Environment and Forests, the principal regulatory agency, to form a special commission to study the safety and merits of continuing with constructing dams in India‚Äôs most important hydropower state.

The commission, appointed last year, is unlikely to issue its conclusions until after the national election results are announced in mid-May. Those findings, and their implementation, also are likely to be overseen by the National Green Tribunal, a four-year-old panel of senior jurists that rules on India‚Äôs big environmental cases.

In August, two weeks after the Supreme Court order, the Tribunal said it would hear a case involving flood damage that citizens here in Srinagar said was amplified by the Alaknanda hydropower dam. The Tribunal also is monitoring repairs and construction at the damaged Vishnuprayag dam. The Tribunal‚Äôs presence is a clear indication that its jurists will closely follow other legal and regulatory aspects of the disaster.

Surly Mountains

In December and January, the dry season in Uttarakhand, the Alaknanda and Mandakini Rivers were clear and blue with no angry crest at all. Yet both rivers, and several more affected by the June flood, reflected the grimness of what happened and the strain of what could easily happen again later this year.

The road transport network has not been fully repaired. Transportation is so difficult, newspapers reported in December, that 1,200 tons of food could not be distributed and rotted in place. Hundreds of people are homeless.

India‚Äôs leaders are determined to harness the power of water

The gathering danger is not close to being lifted from Uttarakhand‚Äôs magnificent and hardened Himalayan valleys. So much silt and mud and boulders washed off the hillsides during the June 2013 flood that they filled the riverbeds. The rivers of the Alaknanda and Bhaghirati basin run now on new bottoms that are much higher ‚Äì in some places 30 to 75 meters higher than they were before the flood, according to estimates by residents and the Geological Survey of India.

Unless that rubble is removed, which amounts to a monumental and costly excavation project and has not started, the approaching monsoon season could easily overflow riverbanks and cause more flood damage to dams and communities this summer.

India‚Äôs political leaders are determined to harness the power of water flowing down these steep mountain gorges. India estimates its hydropower generating capacity is 150,000 megawatts, more than all nations but China, Brazil, and Canada. Most of the new capacity was planned for the world‚Äôs tallest and most dangerous mountains range. But hydro generating capacity, now just over 40,000 megawatts or 14 percent of the country‚Äôs total electrical generating capacity, is growing little more than 1,000 megawatts annually, according to the Central Electric Authority.

At that rate, it will take India a century to reach its hydro generating goal.

Several low-lying areas along the Yamuna were flooded on Wednesday as water rose to unprecedented levels reaching 207.2 metres at the Old Railway Bridge. A statement from the Chief Minister‚Äôs office also noted that a person taking bath at Majanu Ka Tila drowned in the Yamuna and his body is yet to be recovered.

The Delhi Government deployed all its personnel and resources for rescue and relief measures while Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit visited camps set up in various areas such as Mayur Vihar Phase-I, DND flyover and along L.M. Bandh.

Ms. Dikshit noted that the highest ever quantity of water has been released from Hathini Kund this year and that her administration was on the alert and ready to respond as per the situation. She interacted with the flood-affected people and advised them not to panic as the government has taken adequate measures. Till date 400 people have been rescued while 5,000 have been evacuated and provided shelters at 19 camps. Further, 62 boats and adequate number of divers have been deployed.

While the Delhi Government has stated that low-lying areas may face disruption in power supply and the administration is taking steps to repair the lines, discom sources said the Delhi Government has asked them to restrict electricity supply to certain low-lying areas as a precautionary measure. Some of the affected areas inclue Vishkarma Colony, Jaitpur and Dhobi Ghat. Discom sources said 82 power connections have been suspended in the Badarpur Khader area falling in the Karawal Nagar division while 172 connections have been switched off in low lying areas of Garhi Mandu, Usmanpur, Gurudwara and Bela farm areas. On Delhi Jal Board request , connections to two ranney wells each in Lakshmi Nagar and Krishna Nagar divisions have been disconnected.

In addition, the city government has asked the Army to be on alert for helping the civil administration if required. The river crossed the danger level of 204.83 m on Tuesday morning, prompting authorities to evacuate around 2,000 people from various low-lying areas in East Delhi like Usmanpur, Yamuna Bazar, Bhajanpura and Shastri Park and set up relief camps for their shelter.

Almost 20,000 people are stranded and at least 1000 confirmed dead in the wake of extreme floods in northern India, caused by an early monsoon.

Experts are blaming poor local planning and a destructive approach to development in the Himalayan foothills. They say these have left the region vulnerable to floods and landslides ‚Äì which will only get worse under climate change.

‚ÄúThe current devastation and human misery is largely man-made,‚Äù says Maharaj Pandit, head of the department of environmental studies at the University of Delhi. ‚ÄúRampant unauthorised and mindless building activities on the river flood plains in the Himalaya‚Äù, deforestation and other activities that destabilise slopes are responsible for the loss of life, he says.

Cutting trees on mountainsides loosens up the soil, making landslides more likely. In addition, the government has earmarked 292 dams for construction in the Indian Himalayas. Their construction involves diverting rivers, destroying ecosystems and increasing industrial traffic ‚Äì all of which destabalises the soil on the mountainsides, making landslides more likely, says Pandit.

The dams also directly cause flooding that wouldn‚Äôt happen otherwise, he says. During heavy rain, dam operators release more water to safeguard their infrastructure. ‚ÄúDelhi, for instance, was flooded because Hathnikund barrage in upstream Haryana released more water,‚Äù Pandit says.

Early monsoon

Allowing enormous flows of religious pilgrims into the area was irresponsible, says Pandit, making the human impact worse as many were caught out by the earlier-than-usual monsoon rains. ‚ÄúWe may not have seen the worst,‚Äù he warns.

Bhupendra Nath Goswami, director of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, warns that the rapid bursts of heavy rain behind this flood are increasingly likely to happen. ‚ÄúThe frequency of extreme rain events is increasing over the Indian continent,‚Äù he says.

According to Goswami, a strong updraft was produced in recent weeks as warm moist air from the south encountered cold air from the north. ‚ÄúIn such a case, all the moisture precipitates in a short time leading to an extreme rain event.‚Äù It‚Äôs not clear whether this particular event is linked to climate change, but similar events are likely to happen more frequently. ‚ÄúWe must prepare ourselves,‚Äù says Goswami.

Responsible development is key, he says. ‚ÄúMost of the current devastation is due to mud slides and landslides. For the same amount of rain, an order of magnitude larger damage takes place.‚Äù

Despite the difficulties predicting weather in the tropics, Goswami says these rain storms were predicted three days in advance. ‚ÄúStill we were not prepared. This is entirely a failure of our disaster preparedness system and disaster management strategy.‚Äù",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The rains came to Mussoorie, a hill town in Uttarakhand, in northern India, last Friday, June 14. Rushing mud and water stopped the town in its tracks, leaving swaths without power. Over the weekend, trains were canceled, the busy Dehradun-Delhi road was closed, and frequent landslides led to hours-long traffic jams on the narrow mountain streets. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen such violent rain in a while,‚Äù says Rupa Devi, a local. ‚ÄúFor the first time in my life, I cannot read the skies.‚Äù

By Sunday, it was official that Uttarakhand was in the grips of the worst flood in a hundred years. Now, a week on, more than 65,000 people are stranded across the state and more than 500 have died. ‚ÄúThe priority for the authorities at the moment is to rescue the stranded and provide urgently needed succor to those most in need of it,‚Äù Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the press. Rescue workers have thus far managed to save 10,000 people.

Uttarakhand, known as the ‚Äúland of gods‚Äù for the various temples that dot its hills, is extremely popular among pilgrims and tourists. It houses some of the country‚Äôs most famous religious shrines, including Kedarnath and Badrinath, Yamunotri, Gangotri, together often referred to as the Char Dham, or the four pilgrimages. The trip is particularly popular among older Indians, as well as Indians who live overseas. Of the people who have died in Uttarakhand, 50 have died near the famous Kedarnath temple, which is now covered in mud and slush and will remain off-limits for pilgrims for at least a year, officials say.

The picturesque region is experiencing staggering growth, changing a fragile Himalayan landscape. According to the Uttarakhand State Transport Department, the state has seen a 1,000% increase in tourist vehicles from 2005 to 2013. ‚ÄúYou have now almost 100,000 religious tourists in a season as compared to 5,000 to 6,000 in the ‚Äô70s and ‚Äô80s,‚Äù says noted environmentalist Maharaj Pandit. ‚ÄúSuch a huge footfall has necessitated massive urbanization including road widening and road building, which are connected to landslides and landslips.‚Äù

Indeed, the tourism boom is taking a toll. Shantytowns are springing up, cheap hotels have mushroomed, and, amid the rush, construction codes are being ignored. Experts say this unbridled urbanization likely contributed to the devastating floods. Deforestation is particularly risky and is getting worse, Pandit warns. ‚ÄúDeforestation in the Himalayas has been going on unabated since the British times commercially despite government‚Äôs claim of forest cover increasing,‚Äù he said.

For now, Uttarakhand is focused on rescue and recovery. When the skies clear, this young state, carved from Uttar Pradesh in 2,000, must take a moment to consider what comes next. The lesson, experts say, is that the region‚Äôs tourism boom will mean little unless the industry realizes that sustainability and safety go hand in hand.

delhi,2013,https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/hzKmWekwYOOtYKv8N6dZlN/Dont-blame-nature-for-the-Uttarakhand-flood-disaster.html,27-Jun-13,Don‚Äôt blame nature for the Uttarakhand flood disaster,"Uttarakhand has only reaped what it sowed. With more than 1,000 lives lost in the calamity, and losses estimated to be above ‚Çπ 3,000 crore, this might seem like a cruel, insensitive, politically incorrect thing to say. But facing up to the truth is the least that we owe to the many who have paid with their lives for the greed of a few.

In fact, it might serve us well to remember a true son of the fast-eroding Uttarakhand soil who martyred himself trying to communicate a message to the state administration that, if heeded, would have gone a long way in minimizing (if not preventing) the scale of destruction wrought by the rains.

On 13 June, 2011, exactly two years before this disaster (the spell of heavy rainfall that triggered the floods began on 14 June, 2013), a sadhu known as Swami Nigamanand passed away at the Himalayan Institute of Medical Sciences at Dehradun. He had been on an indefinite fast to protest against the rampant stone crushing and strip mining along the banks of the Ganges in Uttarakhand.

Incidentally, in his final days, Swami Nigamanand shared the ICU with another sadhu who also happened to be engaged in a protest fast at that time‚ÄîBaba Ramdev. Indeed, in a country with a well-deserved reputation for kowtowing to sadhus and babas, it is instructive to look at what kind of sadhus and babas we actually care about.

As it turned out, the demagoguery of a self-styled yoga guru turned anti-corruption crusader hogged the limelight while the sadhu who crusaded for the environment and preached respect for the river was allowed to die‚Äîhe passed away on the 76th day of his fast.

Swami Nigamanand‚Äôs demise drew barely a handful of mentions in the national press. The cause he fought for‚Äîquickly forgotten. And the Uttarakhand administration is still in denial about the real causes of the flood damage, causes the Swami (among many others) had dedicated his life to fighting, in vain.

In an interview earlier this week, the Uttarakhand chief minister Vijay Bahuguna was asked point blank if this was a man-made tragedy. His answer: ‚ÄúThis is a childish argument by people who don‚Äôt understand nature but want to embarrass the governance.""

It is not clear whether one should interpret this statement as a lie or as a sign of the esteemed leader‚Äôs ignorance. But if we can make the reasonable assumption that the head of the department of environmental studies at Delhi University (DU) is a person who understands nature in a non-childish way, this is what he had to say about the Uttarakhand floods when asked by the New Scientist, a magazine that ought to know a thing or two about people who understand nature: ‚ÄúThe current devastation and human misery is largely man-made."" The DU professor, Maharaj Pandit, added that ‚Äúrampant unauthorized and mindless building activities on the river flood plains in the Himalayas"" are the prime causes of the disaster.

There are enough studies and data to establish that a disaster such as this is not only man-made but also, by that token, pre-ordained. It is a matter of common sense that if you build on river beds and flood plains, your structures will be washed away when the rains come and the river bed/flood plains fill up with water. That is why even the barely literate, part-time farmers who reside in, and grow vegetables on, the Yamuna flood plains in Delhi pack their belongings and shift onto higher ground every year just before the monsoon.

It is also a matter of common sense that if you mine river beds for sand and gravel, if you indiscriminately divert forest land for mining, and if de-silting of rivers is not carried out, then you are setting yourself up for extreme soil erosion, landslides, and flash floods of unmanageable magnitude. But sadly enough, it is common in our myopic vision of development to choose short-term ‚Äúsolutions"" over long-term sustainability. What passes for development in Uttarakhand is nothing but the material manifestation of the will to power‚Äîand pelf‚Äîof a shifting consortium of politicians, builders, real estate speculators and sand-mining contractors.

According to media reports, when the floods struck, about 28 million tourists were visiting the state, while the local population is close to half that number. First of all, it is irresponsible to let such a huge volume of human traffic into an ecologically sensitive area, that too in the monsoon season. But once the decision had been taken to milk tourism to the maximum, you would naturally need to build infrastructure to cater to such tourist inflows. This requires planning. And given the fragile nature‚Äîof both the climate and eco-systems‚Äîof the Himalayan region, it also requires a strict adherence to building and environmental norms. The first principle of disaster management is prevention‚Äîby taking the necessary precautionary measures. But Uttarakhand, captive to local interest groups, has been doing the exact opposite: actively soliciting disaster.

As recently as February 2013, the Uttarakhand high court had passed an order asking the state government to demolish structures that had come up within 200 metres of the river banks. But the administration did not act. When the floods came, many of those illegal structures got demolished anyway.

Such short-sightedness and flawed (or zero) planning is not unique to Uttarakhand. It is a unique Indian tradition that finds expression even in the most modern of our achievements, and in triumphs we take pride in, such as, for instance, the Delhi Metro. According to a new UN study, the Delhi Metro ‚Äúignored disaster threats during planning"" as a result of which 50 stations were at high risk, leaving it susceptible to massive casualties when disaster strikes in the form of floods or earthquakes.

But one cannot blame the flouting of norms on corruption alone‚Äîthe reality is not so simple. It is fashionable‚Äîespecially among those who believe that eliminating corruption will solve all of India‚Äôs problems and turn us into a superpower‚Äîto pooh-pooh environmental activists as Luddites, doomsayers and left-wing loonies. The cabal of bureaucrats, businessmen, technocrats and politicians that call the shots in developmental policy and decision-making‚Äîwhen not corrupt‚Äîtake a perverse pride in a managerial tunnel vision that believes only in ‚Äúgetting things done"". They see environmental issues purely as roadblocks on the path of development, not as facts of nature that must be dealt with on their own terms. They cannot see that human beings‚Äîeven CEOs, bankers and shareholders‚Äîare an integral part of nature and derive their sustenance from it.

Their narrow pragmatism that avoids thinking of the final consequences of their choices is nothing but a form of magical thinking that is different only in degree from that of the other, more populous, and unscrupulous, bunch that simply does not have the time of day for such romantic nonsense as ‚ÄúMother Nature"" and ‚Äúecological balance"", and thinks nothing of deploying all their assets‚Äîcerebral and material‚Äîto circumvent the law and line their pockets.

The problem with bribing your way through the next infrastructure project is that nature does not accept bribes. And the problem with tweaking or ignoring environmental norms to please industry and speed up projects stuck due to ‚Äúenvironmental roadblocks"" is that nature does not operate out of rational self-interest. You cannot negotiate with it‚Äîyou either abide by its rules, or tomorrow, if not today, it will have its way.

Until we find a vaccine for the two kinds of diseased developmental pragmatisms afflicting us ‚Äì the rational-managerial kind that believes only in numbers and data and whose imagination can never apprehend a river or a mountain or a forest as anything other than an economic resource, and the rapacious-crooked kind that wants to exploit everything in as short a time as possible to get rich quick‚Äîwe might have to get used to mega-disasters such as the Uttarakhand floods, and consider them as just another fact of modern life, like traffic jams and security checks.

Authorities have evacuated around 1,500 people from various low-lying areas in east Delhi like Usmanpur, Yamuna Bazar, Bhajanpura and Shastri Park and set up relief camps for their shelter.

""The water level of Yamuna crossed the danger mark of 204.83 metres at 7 am and it reached 205.58 metres at 7 pm,"" officials in the Flood Control and Irrigation department said.

They said the water level would touch 207.05 meter around noon tomorrow as 9.5 lakh cusecs of water released by Haryana in the last two days is expected to reach Delhi.

Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit said the situation was under control and there was no need to panic as the administration was prepared to face any eventuality.

The Old Yamuna Bridge, connecting east Delhi with the heart of the national capital, was shut for rail and road traffic early Tuesday morning after the water level in Yamuna rose dangerously.

Haryana had released eight lakh cusecs of excess water into Yamuna from the Hathnikund barrage near Yamunanagar yesterday while it released over 1.5 lakh cusecs today.

The closure of the Old Yamuna bridge resulted in diversion of traffic in East Delhi, resulting in choking of various arterial roads in the area.

""The situation is under control. There is no need to panic. The concerned departments and agencies are taking all precautionary measures to deal with any eventuality,"" Dikshit said.

The Chief Minister said she has been keeping a close watch on the flood situation and the level of the water in Yamuna apart from keeping in touch with all agencies concerned to ensure the safety of people.

Officials in the Flood and Irrigation department said they have completed evacuation of the people from low-lying areas.

Officials said the army has been asked to be on alert for helping the civil administration, if required.

They said over 400 tents have been put up in four districts - 240 in East district, 100 in South East district, 50 in Central district and 30 in North East district to accommodate the affected people.

Sixty two boats with divers have also been pressed into service to rescue the people.

One Junior Commissioned Officer of the army has been deployed in the flood control room in East Delhi for proper coordination between the army and the civil administration in relief and rescue operation.

Chief Secretary D M Spolia has directed Sub Divisional Magistrates of affected districts to initiate joint patrolling with police in vulnerable areas to ensure that nobody is left in the flood-prone areas.

The 'Disaster Control Room' in the office of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority has started monitoring the situation and disseminating information regarding the water level in Yamuna through SMS alerts to all key functionaries, said the officials.

Mobile medical teams and water tanks have also been pressed into service to help the affected people.

In the last 40 years, the city had witnessed floods in 1967, 1971, 1975, 1976, 1978, 1988, 1995 and 1998.

Houses and small apartment blocks on the banks of the Ganges, India‚Äôs longest river and sacred to Hindus, have toppled into the rushing, swollen waters and been swept away with cars and trucks.

‚ÄúIt has been a horrifying experience,‚Äù said Tulika Srivastava, a visitor from the northern Indian city of Lucknow, who has been stranded with her 80-year-old mother in the key pilgrimage town of Rudraprayag since last week.

Thousands of military servicemen are involved in rescue operations, with air force helicopters plucking survivors, many of them Hindu pilgrims and tourists, from the foothills of the Himalayas.

About 33,000 people had been rescued so far this week, the home ministry said. Railways were running special trains from the devastated areas to take people home.

‚ÄúWhatever is humanly possible is being done,‚Äù Manish Tewari, the minister of information and broadcasting, told reporters.

The rains had eased on Saturday but more rain is expected early next week, complicating the task of rescuers. Rain will fall from Monday onwards in many places in the Himalayan foothills, said a weather official who sought anonymity.

As many as 150,000 people were airlifted from the reach of the floods, said Dinesh Malasi, a rescue official at Dehradun, the state capital, with 60 helicopters pressed into the task.

Aid workers are struggling to negotiate roads blocked by landslides to reach the Kedarnath Valley, one of the worst affected areas, where thousands of pilgrims have been stranded.

Some of those rescued by helicopter told charity officials in Dehradun they had seen bodies scattered everywhere.

Kedarnath, the site of a temple to a powerful Hindu deity, is 86 km from Rudraprayag in the hill state of Uttarakhand.

‚ÄúThe deaths will certainly rise,‚Äù said Madan Mohan Doval, an official of Sphere India, a group of non-government bodies working in the area that includes international charity Plan as well as the Indian Red Cross Society.

‚ÄúPeople are in immediate need of basic aid such as dry food, clean drinking water, clothes, medicines, tarpaulin sheets for shelter and blankets,‚Äù Doval added.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has offered 200,000 rupees ($3,400) to the family of each of those who lost their lives and 50,000 rupees ($840) to the injured from his national relief fund. He also pledged money to people who have lost their homes.

Singh promised 10 billion rupees ($167 million) in disaster relief to Uttarakhand, home of the gods in Hindu mythology and the hardest-hit state.

Rishikesh, India CNN ‚Äî

Authorities have relocated more than 5,000 people from affected areas, the network said, citing Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit as saying the situation is under control.

Heavy rain was falling on Gobindghat, a town in the foothills of the Himalayas where Sikh pilgrims stop on their way to a holy site farther into the mountains.

A monsoon deluge had swept in earlier and heavier than usual in this part of northern India, bringing a risk of floods.

But before residents and pilgrims in the town could heed the priest‚Äôs warning, water had engulfed the town.

‚ÄúSome people climbed upwards, some ran here and there,‚Äù said Gurjit Singh, who had traveled to Gobindghat with his 12-year-old son. ‚ÄúIt was chaos.‚Äù

Barrages of water, mud and rocks have hit scores of towns and villages in the Indian state of Uttarakhand in the past week, inundating homes, shrines, roads and vehicles.

Uttarakhand‚Äôs chief minister, Vijay Bahuguna, has described the disaster as a ‚ÄúHimalayan tsunami.‚Äù

Dotted with temples and often referred to as ‚Äúthe Land of Gods,‚Äù Uttarakhand attracts large numbers of pilgrims from around India to its mountainous reaches. Those travelers, many of them far from home and short on belongings, are now caught up in the destruction.

Thousands of rescue workers are trying to reach more than 50,000 people cut off by the waters. Bahuguna told CNN‚Äôs sister network CNN-IBN on Friday night that the death toll was 556 but could rise. The bodies ‚Äúwere either buried or floating in slush,‚Äù he said. It will take 15 days to complete evacuations in the province, he added.

Other parts of northern India, including New Delhi, have also been hit by flooding, but Uttarakhand has suffered the worst of the devastation.

The rains over the region have eased in the past few days, aiding in the rescue of about 30,000 people, Bahuguna said.

‚ÄòA second life‚Äô

‚ÄúThere was nothing but death in front of us,‚Äù Singh said Thursday after getting out of a crowded car ferrying people to dry, flat land. ‚ÄúNow that we‚Äôve got out, we feel like we‚Äôve got a second life.‚Äù

His son, Rana Udesh Pratap, said the trek to safety was long.

‚ÄúI held my father‚Äôs hand and walked and walked and walked on a narrow path,‚Äù he said. The two had made a pilgrimage to Uttarakhand from the nearby state of Punjab to visit the Sikh Hemkunt Sahib shrine.

Others were still struggling with what they had endured.

A man named Kailash told CNN-IBN that he, his wife and 4-year-old son didn‚Äôt know how they were going to get back to their home in Jodhpur, hundreds of kilometers to the southwest.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a penny, how will we reach home?‚Äù he asked, explaining that his family had gone hungry for three days before they were evacuated to a hospital in the town of Rudrapyrayag.

They had been in Kedarnath, a centuries-old Hindu holy town at the heart of the destruction. Pictures show the town‚Äôs temple surrounded by mud and rocks.

Kailash recalled what he and his family endured before they were flown out.

‚ÄúWe had to walk over dead bodies,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNothing is left there, everything is finished. We can‚Äôt even find our relatives.‚Äù

A search for the missing

Others were searching for relatives amid the chaos. A Facebook page for rescue and relief in Uttarakhand was peppered with pleas for help in finding people.

‚ÄúIt is with great hope that I am writing to you to alleviate the distress of my family,‚Äù wrote Shantalu Srivastava in a post seeking information about his brother, sister-in-law and two nieces.

Srivastava said that the family had traveled to Kedarnath from Lucknow, in the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh, and that he had last heard from them Sunday.

The national government has dispatched the army to help with rescue efforts and promised 10 billion rupees ($170 million) in disaster relief funds to the Uttarakhand government.

Some observers are saying the disaster was man-made.

Officials in New Delhi said some 1,000 people may have died in the floods and avalanches triggered by torrential rain, as army soldiers carried out relief and rescue operations and intensified searches for those stranded in the hilly areas.

Shashidhar Reddy, vice-chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority, told reporters in New Delhi that rescue teams were reaching more remote regions, and that he expected the death toll to soar from the current figure of about 150 people. The devastation is massive, Reddy said.

Figures for the death toll have varied considerably, underscoring the difficulty in reaching isolated areas. An Uttarakhand state lawmaker, Shaila Rani Rawat, put the death toll at 2,000, but disaster management officials could not confirm this.

More than 33,100 people have so far been rescued, as the military takes advantage of clearer weather, but another 50,400 are still stranded, the home ministry said in a statement released late on Thursday.

Houses, buildings and vehicles have collapsed or been swept away by overflowing rivers and landslides, while bridges and narrow roads leading to pilgrimage towns have also been destroyed, officials said.

‚ÄúThe Kedarnath sector is our main concern,"" said Anil Chait, the army general who is heading the operations. ‚ÄúIt is the worst affected, and the most inaccessible. Our estimates are that over 3,000 people are stranded there in various pockets.""

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh launched an online appeal for funds, asking ‚Äúall citizens of India to stand with our distressed fellow countrymen"" and ‚Äúdonate generously"".

Singh said the number of casualties is expected to rise as he announced a ‚Çπ 1,000 crore relief package. More have died in the neighbouring hill state of Himachal Pradesh.

The Indian Army, the Indian Air Force, Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force, the National Disaster Response Force and the Uttarakhand government are all involved in the rescue and relief work.

‚ÄúA lot of the villages in the route to Kedarnath have been completely wiped out,"" said Barinder Jit Singh, superintentendent of police of Rudraprayag, who is coordinating operations from the district.

Flash floods that swept a temple complex in the region left an unspecified number dead, sweeping the bodies downstream.

The army‚Äôs relief mission, called Operation Surya Hope, has been intensified with as many as 5,500 troops taking part in rescue efforts and an additional 2,500, including paratroopers, set to join the operation on Friday.

Three helicopter landing positions have been created in the Kedarnath area, and three more will be built on Friday.

‚ÄúOur priority remains evacuation and emergency supplies to those who are stuck,"" said General Chait.

Rakesh Negi, a resident of Gauchar, a small town at a height of 771 metres in Chamoli district, walked four days from Kedarnath with his two teenage sons to escape the destruction caused by the flash floods.

‚ÄúIt was terrible,"" he said. ‚ÄúThe water broke through everything, and it brought huge boulders, bigger than cars, and it smashed through everything.""

Negi and his sons were lucky to be on relatively high ground, in a village called Gauri, which the flood waters missed by a few feet.

‚ÄúIt was raining, so I thought the situation will only get worse,"" he said. ‚ÄúSo we just started walking through the high areas, through the jungles. We had no food for four days. We had no idea if we would make it back.""

Hundreds of locals have trekked through the forests, and are continuing to stream into towns in the lower reaches.

The situation in Hemkund and Badrinath, where the army estimates close to 18,000 people are still stuck, is more stable.

‚ÄúThey are on high ground, and it‚Äôs much easier to reach those places,"" Gen. Chait said. ‚ÄúWe have started putting in temporary bridges there.""

The air force, which carried out some 100 sorties on Thursday using 22 helicopters, said the main concern was the weather.

‚ÄúEach day is critical,"" said Group Captain Sandeep Mehta. ‚ÄúWe are racing against time hoping that it doesn‚Äôt rain anytime soon.""

The death toll in the disaster has climbed to 560, but many people are still missing, raising fears that the toll will mount higher.



Heavy cloud, mist and intermittent rains hampered the operation to airlift people from the worst-hit areas in Uttarakhand state. Soldiers focused on restoring bridges and repairing access routes as they raced to bring survivors to safety amid forecasts of more downpours in the coming days.



Priests are being asked to begin mass cremation of the victims in the town of Kedarnath - a pilgrim spot that was among the worst hit areas.



It has been a week since heavy monsoon rains caused widespread devastation in the Himalayan region, washing away roads, bridges and entire villages.



About 80,000 people have been rescued so far. Many recounted distressing experiences of doing without food and shelter for days.



But thousands remain stranded, while an unknown number are missing. Relatives are desperately searching for family members.



V.K. Duggal, a senior official of the National Disaster Management Authority in New Delhi, denied charges of a slow response to the disaster.



‚ÄúReally speaking there are no major gaps in coordination. And all agencies are doing their very best to make sure that the relief and rescue operations moves smoothly and at as good a speed as possible,"" Duggal said. ""There may be some impediments of weather, this, that, but when you have a problem of this massive size, at the operational level, there will be some plusses and minuses.‚Äù



Many charities have rushed volunteers to the region to supplement the official rescue and relief operation. Among them is Save the Children, which has sent in a team to assist people displaced by the floods.



Latha Caleb, head of the charity's operations in India, said people in many areas are running out of food rations and need shelter and warm clothing. But she said even accessing the flood-hit regions is posing a challenge for volunteers.



‚ÄúThey themselves have had to abandon vehicles, move on foot and take other vehicles after a point of time,"" Caleb explained. ""Most of the communities are taking shelter in buildings that are kind of precariously standing there. There is no food, no water and there is a big need for medical help.""

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday announced a financial assistance of Rs. 1,000 crore to Uttarakhand for disaster relief. Of this, Rs. 145 crore would be released immediately.

In a statement made after an aerial survey of the hilly regions of the State, where torrential rains wreaked havoc and caused extensive damage in the past few days, Dr. Singh said he had directed all Central agencies to render all possible assistance in their capacity to the State. UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi accompanied the Prime Minister during the aerial survey.

Dr. Singh announced ex-gratia assistance of Rs. 2 lakh each to the families of those killed and Rs. 50,000 each to those who injured from the Prime Minister‚Äôs National Relief Fund (PMNRF).

Further, the Centre would provide from the PMNRF ex-gratia assistance of Rs.1 lakh each to those whose houses were completely destroyed and Rs. 50,000 each to those whose houses were damaged.

‚ÄúWe saw for ourselves the large scale devastation that has been caused in the State. Our hearts go out to the families of those who have lost their lives and those who have suffered injury or loss of property in this huge tragedy,‚Äù the Prime Minister said. The priority for the authorities was to rescue the stranded persons and provide relief to the affected people.

‚ÄúAssessing the magnitude of the losses, both in terms of lives lost and houses destroyed, or the damage to buildings, roads and other infrastructure, is an exercise that will take some more time,‚Äù he said. Dr. Singh added that both he and Ms. Gandhi were distressed by the devastation caused by flash floods and rains.

While estimates put the death toll at 102, it was feared that loss of lives could be much higher. So far, more than 10,000 people had been rescued and were being provided food, clothing and shelter. Many persons were still stranded. The maximum damage was in Kedarnath and its vicinity, Dr. Singh noted.

The Central and State governments would continue to work in close coordination to ensure that every possible effort was made, not only to provide immediate relief to the affected people, but also to help them reconstruct their lives, Dr. Singh said.",solution,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 20, 2013","['Kedarnath', 'Rudraprayag', 'Chamoli', 'Pithoragarh', 'Uttarkashi']","['Kedarnath: 300 mm', 'Rudraprayag: 250 mm', 'Chamoli: 200 mm', 'Pithoragarh: 150 mm', 'Uttarkashi: 100 mm']","['10,000 houses destroyed', '100 bridges damaged', '13,000 km of roads damaged', '102 people killed']",,"['Thousands of people stranded', 'Major disruption to transportation', 'Loss of livelihoods', 'Environmental damage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

is showing a stable trend on Tuesday, there is no respite to the people living in flooded areas. The local administration claims that all possible measures are being taken to provide relief to the people but these are proving insufficient.

GangaBesides the rural area, a vast stretch of urban localities in low-lying areas is also badly hit by the flood.The urban flooding is considered as a recent phenomenon by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). According to NDMA's National Disaster Management Guidelines for management of floods, flooding in the cities and the towns is a phenomenon, caused by frequent instances of heavy rainfall in a short period of time, indiscriminate encroachment of waterways, inadequate capacity of drains and lack of maintenance of the drainage infrastructure. Of late, it had aggravated.The urban areas of eastern UP in districts like Varanasi, Mirzapur, Ghazipur and Ballia are experiencing the worst floods after 1978. The highest flood point of Ganga was recorded at the level of 73.901 metres in Varanasi, 80.340 metres in Mirzapur and 65.220 metres in Ghazipur in 1978. However, the highest flood point in Ballia was 60.250 metre in 2003.According to the daily bulletin of the Middle Ganga Division-III of Central Water Commission , the river was flowing 1.368 metres above the danger mark in Varanasi, 1.326 metres above in Mirzapur, 1.805 metres above in Ghazipur and 2.425 metres above the danger mark in Ballia on Tuesday. The level of Ganga almost reached close to the highest flood points in Ghazipur and Ballia. The river was flowing just 31 cms below the highest flood point in Ghazipur and 21 cms below in Ballia. However, the river was flowing 1.271 metres and 1.29 metres below the highest flood points in Varanasi and Mirzapur respectively. As per the forecast of CWC, the level may start receding from Wednesday.Meanwhile, the police department got 75 calls on Monday for rescue and relief of the people trapped in flood in different localities. The police department also made an appeal to general public to contact police control room (100) and Jal Police on 9984386616 for help.According to NDMA report, floods being the most common natural disaster, people have, out of experience, devised many ways of coping with them. However, encroachments into the flood plains over the years have aggravated the flood problem and a need to take effective and sustained flood management measures has been felt. Various measures, structural and non-structural, have been taken by the Central and state governments and as a result, considerable protection has been provided to the people. However, more efforts are required in this direction and there is a need to put in place a techno-legal regime to make structures flood-proof and regulate the activities in the flood plains of the rivers.The report says that there is the risk of drowning and physical trauma along with the threat of diseases associated with contamination of water and the creation of mosquito breeding sites. Direct health effects of a flood may include drowning, injuries like cuts, sprains, fractures, electric shocks, diarrhoea, vector and rodent-borne diseases like malaria , leptospirosis, skin and eye infections and psychological stress.The indirect health consequences of floods are usually due to damage caused to health care infrastructure and loss of essential drugs, damage to water and sanitation infrastructure, damage to crops and disruption of food supplies, destruction of property causing lack of shelter that may lead to increased exposure to diseases.According to report, India's high risk and vulnerability is highlighted by the fact that 40 million hectares, out of a geographical area of 3,290 lakh hectares is prone to floods. On an average every year, 75 lakh hectares of land is affected, 1,600 lives are lost and the damage caused to crops, houses and public utilities is Rs 1,805 crores due to floods.The frequency of major floods is more than once in five years. Floods have also occurred in areas, which were earlier not considered flood-prone. As much as 80% of precipitation takes place during monsoon from June to September. The rivers bring heavy sediment load from the catchments. These, coupled with inadequate carrying capacity of the rivers, are responsible for causing floods, drainage congestion and erosion of river banks.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
delhi,2013,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/naS1OfEY0PssPpyes5Xl3H/Survivors-of-Cyclone-Phailin-return-home-to-destruction.html,15-Oct-13,Ganjam worst hit as floods swamp Odisha in Cyclone Phailin‚Äôs wake,"New Delhi: Even as the Odisha government is grappling with heavy flooding in several areas and the prospect of large-scale rehabilitation following Cyclone Phailin, the meteorological department has predicted heavy rainfall in several northern states as a fallout of the storm.

In Odisha‚Äôs Ganjam district, where Cyclone Phailin made its landfall on Saturday evening, at least 200,000 houses and over 200,000 hectares of agricultural land have been damaged, making it the state‚Äôs worst casualty of the storm. Also, about 40 power transmission towers were uprooted by the cyclone, leaving most of the district without electricity and putting the national grid at strain.

Balasore, Mayurbhanj, Jajpur, Keojhar and Bhadrak districts in the state are flooded, and power distribution systems and grids have been severely damaged in many places, especially in Ganjam, by the severest cyclone to hit the country in several years, state government officials said.

Overall, 13 districts in Odisha were affected by the storm.

The flood situation is grim in Balasore and Mayurbhanj, special relief commissioner of Odisha, P.K. Mohapatra, said over the phone from Bhubaneswar, the state capital. Three teams of National Disaster Response Force and teams of the Orissa Disaster Response Action Force have been dispatched to the most affected areas, he said.

Cyclone Phailin lashed India‚Äôs eastern coast at Gopalpur in Ganjam district with wind speeds of up to 220km per hour around 7.30pm on Saturday, bringing heavy rains across south coastal Odisha and Srikakulam district of north coastal Andhra Pradesh.

Twenty-one people died and 11.9 million people have been affected by the cyclone and the ensuing floods in 128 blocks of the state, according to state administration.

Defence agencies have been pressed into action to airdrop food packets in flood-hit areas. In Balasore district, around 300,000 people are locked by floodwater.

Several areas in Odisha received very heavy rainfall of more than 150mm on Sunday. Balimundali village and Banki town received rainfall of over 350mm on Sunday. On Monday morning, the National Disaster Management Authority warned that Burhabalang river at the National Highway (NH) 5 Road Bridge in Balasore district of Odisha was flowing in ‚Äúhigh flood situation"".

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a ‚Äúhigh flood situation"" warning was issued by the Cyclone Warning Centre for the Burhabalang at the NH-5 Road Bridge in Balasore district as it flowed 1.08m above its danger level on Monday.

‚ÄúVery heavy rainfall can be expected in the plains of Bihar, over north Jharkhand, including Kosi and Gandak river catchments, in the next 24 hours,"" said L.S. Rathore, director general, IMD.

IMD in its latest bulletin added that sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim would also face very heavy rainfall for the next two days, including in the Teesta river catchment. West Bengal could face wind speeds of up to 74km per hour, in gusts, in the next 24 hours.

After heavy rainfall for the next two days, rainfall will start decreasing at many places over Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Gangetic West Bengal. IMD had issued a flood warning for Bihar on Sunday.

In Odisha, while operations at Bhubaneswar airport were resumed and the air traffic control was functioning at its optimum level, Indian Railways suffered an estimated loss of ‚Çπ 12 crore due to the suspension of 165 train services to Odisha and Andhra Pradesh between Saturday and Sunday.

Air India Ltd said it has resumed its schedule, and all flights of private airlines are operating without changes.

‚ÄúAll operations are normal. We have operated three flights already. A fourth one is scheduled as per original schedule,"" an Air India spokesman said.

Some trains services have now been resumed. In addition to the Puri-Howrah section that was opened on Sunday, trains services on the Khundra road-Berhampur- Palasa-Srikakulam-Vishakhapatnam route were also restored, effectively restoring all train services from South India and Mumbai to Bhubaneswar.

While there is not much clarity on the damage to the rail infrastructure, a railway official, who did not want to be named, said: ‚ÄúWe do not see significant damage to rail infrastructure.""

The health department in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha maintained that rapid response teams were taking stock of the situation in real time. In the worst-affected districts, the primary health concern is to ensure access to potable water, said G.V.S. Murthy, director of the Indian Institute of Public Health in Hyderabad.

‚ÄúThe government has an extensive mechanism in place, ensuring access to clean water, food and shelter. There has been minimal loss of livestock in the three worst-affected districts in AP (Andhra Pradesh). Our first worry is outbreak of diarrhoea. We do not have a threat of epidemics as yet,"" said the public health specialist.

‚ÄúThe state government has set up a committee to look at emerging public health concerns. Once water starts receding in these areas, the stagnation could lead to vector borne disease in the next few weeks. It is too early to address that aspect now. The hospitals have not shown any spikes in cases of diarrhoea either, which means people have access to safe drinking water,"" he said.

Large parts of Odisha are without electricity, leading to a blackout in 3,229 villages across Ganjam, which is spread over 8,070.6 sq. km. While the national electricity grid withstood the torrential aftermath of the cyclone, India is trying to cope with a sharp drop in electricity demand and its impact on the grid. This sharp fall in demand has strained the national grid network. The load is still under 100,000 megawatts (MW) from peak demand of around 127,000MW, according to officials managing the country‚Äôs electricity grid.

‚ÄúGanjam has been worst affected. Around 40 transmission towers have been uprooted. It will take a while for the supply to be restored in these areas,"" said a senior Power System Operation Corp. Ltd (Posoco) official requesting anonymity.

Load management functions are overseen by state-owned Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd (PGCIL) and carried out by its subsidiary Posoco. Regional load despatch centres are responsible for maintaining grid discipline and supervising optimum scheduling and delivery of electricity in their regions, and function under Posoco.

‚ÄúAll necessary facilities will be restored in almost all districts by Monday night, but Ganjam will take few more days as it was severely battered. We are on top of the situation and are monitoring it at the highest level,"" said Odisha‚Äôs special relief commissioner Mohapatra.

""Substantial damage to the 33/11kV distribution network in the coastal districts is reported,"" the Union power ministry said in a statement.

While PGCIL‚Äôs networks are fine, the electricity demand in the eastern region including Odisha has dropped, with the state‚Äôs load being only 1,400MW. Odisha has an installed power generation capacity of 4,682.1MW including the state‚Äôs share in central and joint projects. The state had an electricity demand of 3,448MW in August during peak consumption hours‚Äînormally between 8am and 11am, and 6.30pm and 10pm.

‚ÄúYesterday, we had taken a link out as a precautionary measure, but it was restored in a short while. While Odisha‚Äôs load is down, the load in the grid is also short by around 9,000MW due to the rainfall across the eastern region that has reduced demand. The demand is less than 100,000MW. Orissa‚Äôs state distribution network has been impacted,"" said the official quoted above.

‚ÄúOur systems are intact,"" said PGCIL chairman and managing director R.N. Nayak.

Officials are still closely monitoring the grid as the eastern grid that supplies electricity to Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Sikkim and West Bengal is inter-connected to the national grid. Of the five regional grids in the country‚Äînorthern, southern, eastern, north-eastern and western‚Äîall except the southern one are interconnected.

‚ÄúAs required, load and generation were managed in a balanced manner so as to secure stable transmission frequency. Load was not much affected in AP (about 9,000MW against normal demand of 10,000MW). In Odisha, it was reduced to 22-25%, about 600MW (normal demand is 2,800MW),"" the Union power ministry said.

‚ÄúInterruptions in the Talcher-Kolar HVDC link at 3 locations around 23 hours/01.19 hours on 12.10.13/13.10.13, were restored in very short time of less than 30 minutes. Also, the southern connection was maintained through the alternate path of 1,000MW Gazuwaka HVDC back to back link. No AC PGCIL line tripped. However, up to seven lines of 400kV, 17 lines of 220kV and 19 lines of 132kV have been affected concerning the state grid. This affected the power supply in the state,"" the statement added.

delhi,2013,https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/india/safety-and-security,20-Mar-13,Safety and security - India travel advice,"Read this guidance alongside FCDO‚Äôs overall travel advice and warnings for India.

Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.

Terrorism in India

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in India.

There is a heightened risk of terrorism in some Indian regions. Read our advice on regional risks in India for more information.

Terrorist and insurgent groups operating in India include:

Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LET), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM) in Kashmir

Naxalite (radical communist insurgent) groups active in India‚Äôs eastern states

Khalistani extremists operating mainly in Punjab

Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), and other groups may also be planning attacks

Terrorist attacks have mainly targeted Government of India interests. Security has been strengthened, notably at major hotels and transport hubs. However, terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreign nationals, such as:

restaurants, hotels, bars, and markets

stations and airports

places of worship and tourist attractions

festivals, sports venues, and beaches

Take particular care during periods of national or religious significance, such as:

Republic Day (26 January)

Independence Day (15 August)

Diwali (usually in October or November)

Eid (date changes each year)

Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.

Political situation

Strikes (sometimes referred to as ‚Äòbandh‚Äô or ‚Äòhartal‚Äô), political rallies and demonstrations occur frequently and can become violent. The risks are higher during elections and after the death of party or government leaders. Protests may also occur at short notice, especially around days of national importance. Local authorities may impose curfews and other restrictions at short notice. Transport and public services including mobile and internet network coverage may be disrupted at short notice.

You should:

avoid protests or large gatherings, including at religious sites

follow the advice of the local authorities and your travel company

monitor local media and follow any curfew restrictions

Crime

If you‚Äôre the victim of crime, call Police helpline number 100 or National Emergency Number 112 and ask for police assistance.

India‚Äôs Women Helpline Number is 1091.

Protecting your belongings

Keep a copy of your passport, visa, and flight ticket separately from originals when travelling. Leave copies at home where others can access them, and also store them electronically so you can access them easily. If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the police immediately and get a police report.

Take particular care of your possessions on buses, trains and in crowds. Criminals may ride past on motorbikes and snatch valuables.

Be cautious in tourist areas, where scammers, pickpockets and ticket touts target foreigners.

Scams

Cybercrime, internet scamming, card skimming, and confidence scams are common. These scams come in many forms and can pose great financial loss for the victims.

Criminals often use the details of British High Commissions and embassies to carry out their fraud. Be cautious and check the authenticity of details before responding.

Drink and food spiking

As in the UK, be wary of accepting drinks or food from strangers or of leaving drinks unattended. There have been reports of spiked drinks and food, with travellers, including British nationals, subsequently being robbed, or assaulted.

Sexual assault

Sexual assaults occur. This includes attacks on foreign female visitors in tourist areas and cities.

Female travellers often experience verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. Serious sexual attacks involving both Indian and foreign nationals have been reported. British women have been victims of sexual assault, including rape, in Goa, Delhi, Rajasthan, Mumbai and Kerala. Avoid isolated areas, including beaches, when alone at any time of day.

Read our advice for women travelling abroad.

Laws and cultural differences

There may be serious legal penalties for doing something which may not be illegal in the UK.

Dress code

Women travelling in India should respect local customs and dress codes.

Alcohol laws and bans

Laws on alcohol, including buying, drinking and the legal drinking age, vary by state. Get advice from your travel agent, hotel, or the authorities about the laws in areas you are visiting.

It is an offence to drink alcohol in public places, such as public parks.

In some states, foreign nationals and non-resident Indians can buy 30-day alcohol permits.

There is often a ban on the sale of alcohol during major religious festivals, national holidays, and elections.

The consumption, production or transportation of alcohol is banned in:

Bihar

Gujarat

Mizoram

Nagaland

the region of Lakshadweep

Manipur

If you drink or possess alcohol in these states, you could be arrested without bail. Charges can carry a prison sentence of 5 to 10 years.

Smoking and e-cigarette bans

Smoking is banned in most public places. You should only smoke in designated smoking areas.

E-cigarettes and related products are banned. You will be unable to buy e-cigarettes in India or bring them into the country.

Illegal drugs and prison sentences

Do not get involved with any illegal drugs. Drugs are not categorised as they would be in the UK, into Class A, B and C. There is a minimum sentence of 6 months for possession of small amounts deemed for personal consumption only. A 10-year sentence for possession of other amounts applies. The judicial process is slow and being detained for several years whilst your case is processed is normal.

Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas

Activities involving cameras and binoculars, like photography, bird-watching, or plane spotting, may be misunderstood. Be particularly careful near military sites, government buildings, airports, and railway stations.

Swimming safety

Every year, several people drown due to strong currents in the sea. There are strong currents off many coasts. Most beaches do not have warning signs, flags, or lifesaving equipment. Take local advice, follow warnings and instructions issued by lifeguards. Emergency service standards may differ from those in the UK.

Trekking in India

Trekkers should:

travel in groups

use reputable local guides and stay on established routes

check if you need any special permits

Leave details of where you‚Äôre going and when you expect to return with your accommodation. You are extremely unlikely to have a phone signal in the mountains, so make sure your accommodation provider registers your whereabouts using the online C-form.

It is illegal to possess or operate satellite phones without prior permission of the Indian authorities.

The following hazards exist throughout the year, especially above 3,000 metres (m):

altitude sickness - see our advice on Health in India

sudden weather changes, including thunderstorms

avalanches and snow drifts

landslides, flooding, and rock falls

Make sure your insurance policy covers you for altitudes over 2,400m and mountain rescue and helicopter costs.

There are no commercial mountain rescue services operating above 3,000m. In some border areas only the Indian Air Force can carry out air rescues. However, they are under no obligation to perform them and only carry out rescues during working hours.

LGBT+ travellers

Same-sex relationships are legal in India. However same-sex marriage is still illegal. Indian society remains conservative. This includes attitudes to LGBT+ people, which can be less accepting than in the UK. There is a risk of harassment and discrimination, especially outside of big cities.

Showing affection in public can receive unwanted attention.

Read our advice for LGBT+ travellers.

Child custody and family law

Indian family law is very different from UK law. Special caution is needed when child custody becomes an issue. In case of dispute, consult a local lawyer to find out more about the relevant laws.

Commercial surrogacy is illegal for foreign nationals in India. Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) can seek legal guidance on surrogacy if at least one partner is an Indian passport holder.

Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs

It is illegal to buy, sell, kill, or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. India has a strong legal framework to regulate and restrict wildlife trade and is also a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). If you‚Äôre caught purchasing or trafficking such goods illegally, you will be prosecuted and receive a prison sentence or fine.

Sexual offences against children

The penalties for child sex offences are severe. There is a minimum jail term of 20 years, which may go up to life imprisonment, or a death sentence for those convicted of raping a child aged under 12.

Transport risks in India

Be wary of unofficial transport at airports.

British tourists have been scammed by drivers who offer cheap transportation or hotels, unwanted tours, and extended taxi rides. Travellers who accept these offers have reported being threatened with violence when they have declined to pay.

Taxis and rickshaws

When using taxis or rickshaws:

avoid travelling alone and hailing taxis on the street, especially at night

use official taxi ranks. Pre-paid taxi services are available from inside all airport terminal buildings and many hotels offer transfers. Ride-hailing services like Uber and Ola are also widely available in India

if you‚Äôre being collected at the airport by a hotel driver, make sure they properly identify themselves before you set off

if you book a taxi online, there‚Äôs usually a way to share journey details with your contacts who can then follow your location

Cars and motorbikes

Road accidents including car and motorbike accidents are one of the biggest causes of injury and death overseas. Police figures estimate more than 150,000 people are killed every year in road accidents across India. Several British nationals are either injured or killed each year on Indian roads.

Road traffic hazards include:

reckless driving and manoeuvring

poorly maintained vehicles

poor quality and congested roads

roads shared with pedestrians, carts, cattle and other livestock

vehicles running red lights

protests - see our advice on the Political Situation in India

extreme weather and natural disasters - see our advice on Extreme weather in India

Driving in India

If you are planning to drive in India, see information on driving abroad.

You can drive with a UK licence and an accompanying international driving permit after you arrive, but rules on how long you can drive on a UK licence vary from state to state.

Driving can be dangerous in urban and rural areas due to wandering livestock, including cows. Cows are considered sacred in India and road accidents involving cows can draw crowds or potentially lead to violence. If you are involved in a road accident, you may be attacked or become a victim of extortion, even if you were not driving the vehicle. If you hit a cow or pedestrian, you should comply with the police if they are at the scene. If the police are not present, it could be unsafe to remain at the scene of an accident of this nature, if safe to do so you may prefer to find the nearest police station.

It is common to use your horn or flash your headlights frequently to announce your presence on the road.

If possible, avoid travelling at night and in fog as accidents are common due to low visibility and there is a higher risk of crime at night. Always travel in a well-maintained vehicle. Seatbelts are not common in three-wheel taxis (autos) or in the back seats of taxis. Try to use only cars that have seatbelts.

If you travel by motorbike, wear a helmet and proper footwear.

Buses are a convenient mode of transport, serving almost every city across India. However, they are often driven fast and recklessly. Accidents are common.

Vehicles drive on the left in India. Pedestrians should exercise caution when crossing streets, even in marked pedestrian areas and especially at night, as vehicles sometimes drive on the wrong side of the road.

Air travel

When you are travelling through an airport, allow enough time to complete check-in and security procedures, as your baggage may need to go through screening equipment and checks. Allow time for transiting between flights if you need to change from international terminals to domestic terminals, even if using the airport shuttle service.

Tourists flying on charter flights booked through a tour operator can only fly into and out of the country by using the services of the same charter operator. Chartered flight passengers are not permitted to fly on inward or outward journeys using a scheduled airline.

Rail travel

India has a large passenger train network throughout the country. Although train travel in India is generally safe, accidents do occur and have previously resulted in death and serious injury. There are police or guards on trains and stations if you need help.

When travelling by train:

do not accept food or drinks from strangers

thefts are common - take care of your passport and valuables

avoid people at railway stations offering tickets and tours as you may be scammed

Sea travel

Tourist boats and other small crafts rarely carry life-saving equipment.

Although piracy has not so far affected India‚Äôs territorial waters, it poses a significant threat in parts of the Indian Ocean. Mariners should follow shipping industry guidelines on precautions to take.

Ships and crew must have the necessary authorisation and paperwork before entering Indian territorial waters and abide by Indian laws and regulations. If carrying weapons on board ships in Indian territorial waters, you must follow Indian laws and regulations.

Extreme weather and natural disasters

India can experience extreme weather events that can be hazardous to life and disrupt infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and communications.

Plan your travel so that you are aware of seasonal weather events, such as monsoon rains, as well as what to do if there is a natural disaster. Follow the advice of local authorities and your travel company. Consult the Indian Meteorological Department for local and international weather updates.

Monsoons

Highest risk: June to October

Monsoon rains can cause:

flooding and landslides, sometimes leading to significant loss of life

towns and villages to be cut off for days

serious disruption to road and train travel

disruption in big cities due to flooding

other services including telephone lines, internet services and electricity supply to be affected

Cyclones and tropical storms

Highest risk:

East coast of India (September to December)

Bay of Bengal (April to June and September to December)

South India (June to November)

Tropical cyclones can cause:

high winds: buildings can be damaged or destroyed, trees, power and telephone lines toppled, flying debris can be dangerous

storm surges: can provoke a temporary rise in sea level of several metres which can flood coastal areas and damage buildings on the shoreline

very heavy rainfall: this can cause localised or widespread flooding and mudslides

See our advice on Extreme weather and natural hazards for more information.

Earthquakes

Several parts of India lie on highly active fault zones (including areas of the North and North-east). The most active are along the length of the Himalayas. Earth tremors are common in these regions and can cause landslides. Limited emergency response vehicles, equipment, and medical facilities could increase the impact an earthquake has.

FAR is the ratio of the total floor area of a building to the plot area.Earlier this month, Delhi's Urban Development Minister Arvinder Singh Lovely had supported Nath's push for vertical expansion but demanded adequate central funds for enhancing existing infrastructure if such a policy is finalised.""We absolutely have no problem with vertical expansion of Delhi. But when approval is given to high-rises, then we will have to strengthen existing infrastructure like sewage network, water distribution system and power transmission. The Centre will have to provide Delhi government funds for enhancing the infrastructure,"" Lovely had said.In her address, Dikshit also spoke about flash floods in Uttarakhand and blamed ""unregulated constructions"" for the disaster.""What had happened in Uttarakhand is really tragic. It was a man-made disaster. Let us assume, the cloud burst had taken place because of god. But still it is a man made disaster as construction activities had been going on without any logic, without looking into safety issues,"" she said.Underlining the need for protecting the eco-system in Delhi, Dikshit exhorted people to plant saplings to extend the green cover further.""We started the plantation drive when we came to power in 1999.

‚ÄúIt was the first time that this was done,"" said M. Shashidhar Reddy, vice-chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

The UAVs made a reconnaissance of 50 areas in Uttarakhand on Monday, at least 20 of which were locations that rescuers hadn‚Äôt been able to reach to assess damage, Reddy said.

‚ÄúThe idea was to try to use UAVs to scan areas,"" he said.

It was the first time that the drones had been used in the country outside test situations, he said. The vehicle is controlled from a laptop ‚Äúand has a camera attached to it which gives live video of the area,"" he said.

Designed by four former Indian Institute of Technology students, the UAVs have a range of two kilometres and are programmed to return automatically if they go beyond that range.

‚ÄúYou can either control the altitude and the area at the time that it is going around or you can pre-programme it to cover the designated area at a certain altitude,"" Reddy said.

Uttarakhand was hit by the worst floods in more than five decades and landslides last week after unprecedented heavy rain. The home ministry said on Monday that the death toll in the state could reach 1,000. However, some experts said that this was a conservative figure and the death toll is likely to be around 10,000.

NDMA was not prepared to cope with the disaster that took place in Uttarakhand, said Sunita Narain, director general of the Centre for Science and Environment.

‚ÄúWe need much better disaster preparedness. Though there was enough warning from the local meteorological office in Dehradun, the state government failed to send warnings to the pilgrims travelling in the state,"" she said. She was speaking at a South Asia regional consultation on climate change adaptation organized by Unicef in New Delhi on Monday.

Reddy, who was also present at the event, said that the observational and forecast capabilities of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) have been ‚Äúlacking"".

‚ÄúWe have advised IMD officers to...monitor the weather in the state during the time that pilgrims visit the state"" in a meeting held on 19 June, he said.

He also said that the terminology used by IMD needs to be simplified for easier understanding. ‚ÄúHeavy (rainfall) needs to be translated further into millimetres per hour,"" he said.

Climate change will become an important factor in development work in the Himalayan terrain, he said. ‚ÄúThere was an ecological imbalance in the area.""

On the extent of damage caused by the floods, Narain said that the disaster in Uttarakhand is ‚Äúas much man-made as it is natural. Any development strategy that is not environmentally sound will become more disastrous and more tragic. All this means that we cannot afford to get development wrong,"" she said.

Although the disaster in Uttarakhand could not be called an event caused directly by climate change, there definitely were links to it, she said.

‚ÄúClimate change talks about intensification of extreme rainfall events, and this is one of them,"" she said.

Apart from causing disasters, climate change also directly impacts the development and growth of countries, said Lise Grande, United Nations resident coordinator.

‚ÄúAll of the millennium development goals are at risk because of climate change and it poses a serious threat to the development that has taken place in various countries,"" she said.

David Mcloughlin, convener of India‚Äôs United Nations disaster management team (UNDMT), said that there is a need to develop local-level resilience in the country since it is geographically very diverse. ‚ÄúThe government should focus on building response and resilience centres at the district and state level.

CNN ‚Äî

Rescue workers in northern India are scrambling to save tens of thousands of people left stranded by devastating floods that have killed as many as 150 people in the region.

One government official described the flooding as a ‚ÄúHimalayan tsunami.‚Äù

Triggered by unusually early and heavy monsoon rains, the floods have swept away buildings, roads and vehicles in the mountainous state of Uttarakhand, which borders Nepal and China. The neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh has also been hit.

‚ÄúOur hearts go out to the families of those who have lost their lives and those who have suffered injury or loss of property in this huge tragedy,‚Äù said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who carried out an aerial survey of the affected areas in Uttarakhand on Wednesday.

With bad weather hampering rescue efforts and some areas still under water, officials are struggling to gauge the scale of the disaster.

‚ÄúVery heavy casualties are feared and I cannot give the exact number without a proper survey,‚Äù said Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, according to CNN‚Äôs sister network CNN-IBN. He described the severe flooding as a ‚ÄúHimalayan tsunami.‚Äù

Singh said Wednesday that estimates put the number of people killed in the floods at 102, but added that ‚Äúit is feared that loss of lives could eventually be much higher.‚Äù

A local official in Uttarakhand, Om Prakash, said that the death toll in the state had reached 150, but cautioned that he wasn‚Äôt able to give an exact estimate since some villages were still inundated, CNN-IBN reported Thursday. More than 60,000 people remain stranded, the network said.

Flooding hits holy site

With Hindu shrines set amid its stunning scenery, Uttarakhand is often referred to as ‚Äúthe Land of Gods.‚Äù

At the heart of the recent devastation is the town of Kedarnath, the home of a deeply revered Hindu temple that attracts many pilgrims. Images from the area have shown the centuries-old holy town, which sits in a deep valley, swamped with mud and rocks.

Rescue workers reached the town Wednesday and evacuated hundreds of people to safer areas, CNN-IBN reported, but thousands more remain stuck there. The temple is intact, but shops and other buildings surrounding it have been severely damaged, it said.

‚ÄúThe maximum damage has been in Kedarnath and its vicinity,‚Äù Singh said.

Extreme weather

The worst of the heavy rain came in the past few days in a region of India where the monsoon doesn‚Äôt usually arrive for another month, according to Pedram Javaheri, a CNN International meteorologist.

‚ÄúSome areas have seen more than twice their average monthly rainfall totals,‚Äù he said. It‚Äôs ‚Äúthe fastest India‚Äôs ever seen the onset of the monsoon season.‚Äù

The conditions have now improved somewhat, Javaheri said, predicting that the rain ‚Äúshould be scattered in nature for the next couple of days at least.‚Äù

The weather has also brought chaos further south, in the Indian capital, New Delhi, where the Yamuna River has reached its highest level since 2010, according to CNN-IBN.

Flood waters have flowed out into parts of Delhi, inundating streets, shops and homes. Some water from the river has spilled out onto the city‚Äôs Outer Ring Road, potentially disrupting traffic, CNN-IBN reported Thursday.

Authorities have relocated more than 5,000 people from affected areas, the network said, citing Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit as saying the situation is under control.",,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 20, 2013","Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh",more than twice their average monthly rainfall totals,tens of thousands of people left stranded,150,severe flooding,Triggered by unusually early and heavy monsoon rains,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

NEW DELHI‚ÄîFlash floods in northern India, which have killed at least 70 people over the past four days, have stranded 30,000 tourists and pilgrims in the Himalayan states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, government officials said Tuesday.

Rudraprayag, in Uttarakhand, is the gateway to all the major Hindu pilgrimage destinations, like Kedarnath, Badrinath, Joshimath, and June is the peak month for pilgrimages. The floods have made much of Uttarakhand inaccessible by car so the authorities have been using helicopters to evacuate people.

‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt had this kind of a flash flood in the last 100 years,‚Äù said Bhaskaranand, who goes by one name, the state‚Äôs secretary for disaster management, adding that all of the Ganges River‚Äôs tributaries were overflowing their banks.

At least 44 people have died in Uttarakhand, and many more are still missing, he said. ‚ÄúAt least 30,000 tourists are still stranded at different places. We are dropping essential supplies including tinned food, milk, water and medicines by air,‚Äù said Mr. Bhaskaranand.

He said that 15 air force helicopters were sent to evacuate 500 people on Tuesday and that another 15 helicopters would be used on Wednesday. Joining the rescue efforts are 500 National Disaster Rescue Force personnel, 1,000 officers from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and 50 Indian Air Force personnel.

‚ÄúThe road network beyond Rudraprayag is completely damaged,‚Äù I.S. Negi, inspector general of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, said by phone. ‚ÄúThe damage is so extensive that it will take months to repair it.‚Äù

In Himachal Pradesh, at least 11 people have died in the districts of Kinnaur and Sirmaur. The state government has sent two helicopters to rescue stranded pilgrims, including some foreigners.

In Kinnaur, the amount of rain was 1,200 percent more than normal, and in Sirmaur, it was 700 percent, said Amandeep Garg, special secretary for disaster management in Himachal Pradesh. ‚ÄúAll the tributaries of Sutlej River are overflowing due to flash floods,‚Äù he said.

In the Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh, at least 15 people died as the heavy rains caused the Yamuna River to swell. ‚ÄúThe river bank has broken at two places, and we are trying to repair that,‚Äù said A.K. Singh, district magistrate of Saharanpur.

New Delhi is also facing the threat of floods as the Yamuna River, which runs through the capital, is rising to dangerous levels. Residents near the river bank have been advised by the government to move to higher ground.

Relief agencies were putting up tents for displaced residents,as they expected water levels to keep rising over the next two days.

From the Hathini Kund barrage in Haryana state, 800,000 cubic feet of water per second was flowing into the Yamuna River, which was unprecedented, said Sheila Dixit, the chief minister of Delhi. ‚ÄúWe have made all possible preparations and are now praying to God.‚Äù

India experiences natural disasters every year during the monsoon season, and public safety experts have questioned its emergency management plans. India formed the National Disaster Management Authority in 2005 through an act of Parliament, with the prime minister as its chairman. The country also has a national disaster rescue force.

‚ÄúA certain level of disaster preparedness is always there,‚Äù said Mr. Bhaskaranand of Uttarakhand. ‚ÄúBut we cannot prepare for nature‚Äôs fury.‚Äù",flood,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, India","June 16, 2013","June 20, 2013","Rudraprayag, Uttarakhand","1,200% more than normal","30,000 tourists and pilgrims stranded",70,extensive damage to roads and infrastructure,the floods are the worst in 100 years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Many expect the number of casualties to rise, as bodies are said to have been washed away by the flash flooding. Among some 60,000 stranded are Hindu pilgrims from across India, visiting the area‚Äôs holy shrines. Currently some 45 military helicopters and 10,000 troops are engaged in rescue operations hampered by washed roads, bad weather, and continuing landslides. Still, some 33,192 pilgrims had been rescued as of Thursday, according to a ministry press release.

‚ÄúThe tragedy is huge and damages tremendous with vast tracts of land still submerged under tons of debris. The casualties could run into several hundreds,‚Äù the state's chief minister, Vijay Bahuguna, said in a press conference Thursday.

Analysts and environmental activists say the tragedy is man-made, blaming the government‚Äôs drive to increase infrastructure at too fast a rate.

""The damage has not taken place only because of water, which tends to flow away. It has happened due to the sediments and debris that has come with the water, thanks to the intense blasting deep inside the mountains for two hydro-power projects,"" says Bharat Jhunjhunwala, an environmental activist who lives nearby.

""Aquatic life and ecological balance in the hills has been disturbed by the hydropower projects,"" Mr. Jhunjhunwala says. ""This is the price we are paying for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's single-minded determination to produce electricity at whatever cost.""

A report by India's Comptroller and Auditor General three years ago warned that more than 200 hydropower projects in the state were overlooking environmental concerns, which could be catastrophic in the event of a flash flood. Pointing out that massive deforestation was not being met with any serious reforestation, the report had said that in the event of a flood ""the river will behave as 'hungry waters' scouring sediments from riverbeds and river banks downstream to restore the natural sediment levels of the water.""

Ecological mismanagement such as hydropower projects, the expansion of roads, and tourism infrastructure all contributed to the disaster, according to the report. The way to prevent this in the future, say analysts is to take a more calculating look at updating India‚Äôs infrastructure.

""This massive and singularly unfortunate calamity is telling us that we need to re-look at how we develop,‚Äù says Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science and Environment. ‚ÄúWe must regulate our infrastructure growth for tourism. The government needs to be better prepared with improved infrastructure to meet this kind of eventuality and avoid such destruction to life and property.

The normally tame Bow and Elbow Rivers that course their way through downtown Calgary, Alberta, have taken over the city, transforming Canada's fourth-largest city into North America's Venice. A slow-moving storm system, coming on top of an unusually wet spring, has produced massive flooding across southern Alberta, prompting tens of thousands to hastily evacuate sections of Calgary, and producing surreal images of the city's landmarks, such as the Calgary Stampede grounds, under several feet of water.

According to CBC News reports, the resort town of Banff has been cut off from road access after a torrent of water and mud took out a section of the Trans-Canada Highway. The picturesque Banff and Canmore areas to the northwest of Calgary received more than 6 inches of rain on June 20 alone, and have received more than 200 percent of their typical monthly rainfall during the past month.

The situation in Alberta is only the latest example of destructive flooding events that have struck disparate locations in the Northern Hemisphere during the past two months. Germany, Hungary, and the Czech Republic all were deluged with some of their worst flooding in decades during May and June, and torrential downpours related to the South Asian Monsoon killed nearly 600 in India this week, as the mighty Ganges River swelled near Haridwar, about 130 miles north of New Delhi.

While the triggers for each of these flooding events have been unique and complex, involving everything from the location and operation of dams and other water management infrastructure to weather patterns that seemed to get stuck in place, new scientific research shows that during the course of the next several decades, global warming is likely to increase the risk of river flooding events around the world, putting millions more people at risk, especially in rapidly growing developing countries in Southeast Asia, South Asia, eastern Africa, and the northern half of the Andes.

A study published in the journal Nature Climate Change on June 9 found that flood frequency as well as the number of people at risk of inundation from flood events are both likely to increase as the world continues to warm.

The physical science behind the findings is relatively simple: as the air and oceans warm, more moisture is added to the atmosphere, giving storms more water vapor to work with and wring out as rain or snow. Studies have already shown an observed increase in extreme precipitation events in parts of the Northern Hemisphere, including a large uptick in heavy precipitation events in the Midwest and Northeastern U.S. However, until the Nature Climate Change study was published, researchers had not yet been able to shed much insight on the changing contours of global river flood risk.

For example, a 2012 report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found ‚Äúlow confidence‚Äù in projections of future river flooding.

The new study, by a group of researchers in Japan and the U.K., used 11 updated climate models that incorporated river runoff as well as a range of scenarios for how greenhouse gas emissions may change during the next several decades. Their findings showed that for a majority of the world, the frequency of 100-year flood events would increase, but most especially in parts of Southeast Asia and Africa, where countries are not as capable of coping with such flooding.

For many rivers, the study showed that the 100-year flood, which currently has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year, would occur far more frequently in the coming decades ‚Äî on the order of 10 to 50 years, the report found.

The study did not project a major increase in flood risk in North America, where the major flooding is now occurring, and the researchers noted mixed signals from the models regarding Central Europe, which is only beginning to recover from the flooding during the past several weeks. However, the authors cautioned against focusing too closely on regional projections.

‚ÄúBecause of uncertainty, it is difficult to clearly mention ‚Äúthis region will be like this, that region will be like that,‚Äù the researchers said in a statement to Climate Central. ‚ÄúProjection is different than prediction. However, if the warming unfortunately proceeds, the flood risk on a global scale becomes larger.‚Äù



The study clearly showed not only a rising risk of river flooding, but an increase in the population at risk of flooding as well.

Heavy precipitation extremes, which sometimes result in river flooding, have been increasing in much of the U.S. east of the Mississippi River.

By overlaying simulated flooded area on top of population data, the researchers were able to estimate the size of the population at risk of flooding. According to the study, global warming-related changes in flood risk could put between 27 and 93 million people in jeopardy of annual flooding, depending on the amount of warming that occurs.

That includes residents of Calgary, who as they wait to reclaim their city, realize there is no strength in numbers as river-flooding impacts rise in tandem with global warming.

Thousands of people may be dead after flash flooding and mudslides from Indian‚Äôs monsoon, which has settled in earlier and with greater intensity than usual. It is the deadliest global weather event so far in 2013. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The rains responsible for the deadly and destructive flooding arrived in the early to middle part of June and another round is forecast this week.

In the wake of the last round, officials say that thousands of people are still stranded in mountainous portions of the country, and search and rescue missions have been called off in multiple locations.

The death toll is expected to climb to somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 as rescuers will begin searching for bodies among the rubble and mud-covered regions. Eight people were killed in a recovery effort Tuesday when a helicopter crashed.

More than 80,000 Indians have been evacuated from flooded areas since June 16.

The Indian state of Uttarakhand was hit particularly hard, where 680 bodies have been recovered. Disaster Management Minister Yashpal Arya told reporters that bodies stuck under debris from the mudslides have not yet been recovered, which will increase the death toll significantly in the area.

While the official death toll in the region stands at 680, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna said, ‚ÄúVery heavy casualties are feared and I cannot give the exact number without a proper survey.‚Äù

Most of the emphasis has been placed on rescuing those who are stranded, as the forecast calls for heavy rainfall to begin again, strongly hampering the rescues efforts.

The Kedarnath temple area, one of the holiest regions in India, was a focal rescue point with 27,000 trapped people being rescued. The temple did not sustain major damage, but many bodies could be seen scattered across the grounds.

‚ÄúHe stood hanging from the temple bell from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., the day after the disaster struck. He stood on corpses to balance himself. His clothes had been torn to pieces by the water‚Äôs fury,‚Äù his brother-in-law, Ganga Singh Bhandari told the Press Trust of India.

Local authorities and religious figures have a process of mass cremation for the large amounts of recovered bodies, and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has offered 200,000 rupees ($3,400) for families who lost loved ones.

Behind the monsoon

Climate scientists call the Indian monsoon one of the most intense weather events in the world. The rainfall can provide nearly 90 percent of the year‚Äôs total, but it also helps farmers grow crops to feed nearly a billion people.

Being one of the strongest monsoon systems, the Indian monsoon occurs when the winds shift from a northeast land breeze during the cooler months, to the southwesterly sea breeze during the warmest months. The shift in winds is due to the land temperature becoming warmer than the sea temperature, causing a shallow low pressure system to form, and reversing the winds to a counter-clockwise flow.

The southwest winds usher copious amounts of rainfall to the region during the warmest months of June and July, but the rainy weather is often accompanied by followed by periods of hot, dry weather scattered throughout the months.

The GFS model forecasts increased rainfall over the next week to areas such as Uttarakhand, which have been already hit hard.

For three days running, there was no reaction from the Bharatiya Janata Party to reports that the Gujarat Chief Minister, Narendra Modi, had evacuated ‚Äò15,000 Gujaratis‚Äô from Uttarakhand in the course of a two-day visit to the hill State. But with doubts growing over how such a feat was achieved, if it was achievable at all, the party finally broke its silence on Wednesday. BJP president Rajnath Singh said he had spoken to Mr. Modi who denied making any such claim. Mr. Singh also wondered at the source for the figure of 15,000. ‚ÄúWhere did this come from‚Äù? he asked.

The journalist who first wrote the story with the ‚Äò15,000 Gujarati pilgrims‚Äô claim has come out with the answer. He said the figure emerged from Mr. Singh‚Äôs party, the BJP, itself. Anand Soondas ‚Äî chief of the National News Features of Times of India (TOI), and Editor, Sunday Times ‚Äî told The Hindu that his source for the figure was Anil Baluni, the BJP‚Äôs spokesperson in Haldwani in Uttarakhand.

Mr. Soondas said the conversation between him and Mr. Baluni had taken place in ‚Äúthe presence of Uttarakhand BJP president, Tirath Singh Rawat, a bunch of youth leaders from Gujarat and a couple of bureaucrats from Gujarat.‚Äù Mr. Soondas said he had asked them if they were sure if all those taken back were Gujaratis, and the answer was in the affirmative. Mr. Baluni is quoted in the story as saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing what he (Modi) has done here.‚Äù

The Hindu called Mr. Baluni to confirm if he had indeed given the story to Mr. Soondas but he first asked to be called later and then switched off the phone. He was unreachable till late in the evening.

Headlined, ‚ÄúNarendra Modi lands in Uttarakhand, flies out with 15,000 Gujaratis‚Äô, Mr Soondas‚Äôs story had appeared in The Times of India on June 23. The story made many claims in addition to the rescue of 15,000 pilgrims. Among them: requisitioning of four Boeings and 80 Toyota Innovas by Mr. Modi towards passage of the rescued pilgrims; air-dropping of a complete medical team on Hardwar; and setting up of camps across the flood-hit areas.

The Gujarat Chief Minister‚Äôs supporters greeted the news in jubilation, citing it as proof of his super-managerial skills, and saying that the performance of the Centre, the Uttarakhand Government, and even the Armed Forces, had paled in comparison. BJP office-bearers hailed Mr. Modi‚Äôs effort as a model to be emulated by the Centre and other States.

But soon, criticism started on two grounds. The first punctured the ‚Äò15,000‚Äô figure, with several reports showing how it was logistically impossible to conduct such an ‚Äòevacuation‚Äô operation in the limited time span and in the prevailing weather conditions. Others pointed out that even if true, the act of only rescuing Gujaratis, did not enhance the image of a prime ministerial aspirant. It was after this that Rajnath Singh stepped in and questioned the veracity of the story.

Mr. Soondas was unfazed by criticism that he had not exercised due diligence in presenting the 15,000 figure as fact. He said: ‚ÄúI believe rescuing 15,000 people over four days is actually possible since it refers to providing them food, transport, logistics.‚Äù He defended the pitch of the story, and argued: ‚ÄúIt is not possible to say everything in the introduction. The headline seems to have brought a sharper focus to the story.‚Äù

In the past few days, a spate of new stories and blogs ‚Äî sourced to Gujarat government officials ‚Äî have made fresh claims about Mr. Modi‚Äôs rescue efforts in Uttarakhand and praised him for showing the way forward in disaster management.

delhi,2013,https://www.eco-business.com/opinion/black-market-water-expands-delhi/,01-Oct-13,Black market for water expands in Delhi,"On a recent afternoon, as an intense stench rose from a carcass dump, a group of women pushed, shoved, and threw expletives at each other outside a temple in Sangam Vihar on the southern edge of Delhi. The women, carrying a few plastic buckets and empty jerry cans, were fighting to get a place in a line for the water pump inside the temple.

Sangam Vihar is a crowded maze of modest single and double-storied brick homes housing about a million people, mostly workers in the unorganized economy. It is the largest unauthorized urban settlement in Asia.

‚ÄúEveryday 500 people line up to fill water from this tap. On some days close to a 1,000 people line up,‚Äù said Nandini Tiwari, the temple priest‚Äôs wife. ‚ÄúWomen have cracked each other‚Äôs skulls over water outside the temple.‚Äù

Women in the line for water outside the temple complained that the water taps in their houses run dry for weeks at times.

Delhi gets water from the Ganges, from the rivers and dams in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh. ‚ÄúIts gets more water per capita than Paris and Geneva. It has a good network of ranney wells that use its shrinking yet rich supply of ground water. It has decent rainfall and rich water bodies,‚Äù said Himanshu Thakkar, a water expert with the advocacy group, South Asian Network on Dams, Rivers and People.

‚Äú A report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the official auditor of India‚Äôs public sector describing the water supply to various neighborhoods in Delhi shows how a neighborhood‚Äôs location on the pyramid of wealth and influence decides its access to water.

Delhi has a population of 17 million and requires 1.025 billion gallons of water a day, according to Delhi government statistics. Six water treatment plants run by the government produce 818 million gallons of water a day. These official estimates suggest that Delhi faces a shortage of 207 million gallons of water a day.

A report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the official auditor of India‚Äôs public sector describing the water supply to various neighborhoods in Delhi shows how a neighborhood‚Äôs location on the pyramid of wealth and influence decides its access to water.

A water plant in southwestern Delhi‚Äôs Nangloi Jat area produces 40 million gallons of water a day and serves 2.5 million people in western and southwestern areas of Delhi. The report calculated that every person in the area served would get 77 liters of water a day, but its report found out that 1.5 million people in the area served by the Nangloi water plant got less than 50 liters of water a day.

The auditor‚Äôs report shows that the Nangloi Jat area got 225 liters per person every day, while people in poorer villages without political power and wealth, a few miles from Nangloi Jat, got a meager 3.36 liters of water per person a day. It is not a coincidence, since 14 out of the 70 lawmakers in Delhi state assembly come from the influential landed Jat community, which dominates the Nangloi Jat area.

‚ÄúThe Delhi Jal Board neither has a proper measurement system to measure water supplied to different areas nor reliable data about the population in different areas to ensure equitable supply of water,‚Äù the April report noted.

The Delhi government does not provide piped water in most of the unauthorized urban settlements like Sangam Vihar. Instead, the government has dug 118 borewells in Sangam Vihar from where the residents have to draw water. Many have dried out due to over-exploitation over the years.

Workers of various political parties double up as contractors and lay water pipes connecting the borewell to people‚Äôs houses throughout Sangam Vihar. They charge between 50 rupees ($0.79) to 500 rupees ($7.9) from each household for the service.

‚ÄúWe get water once in 15 days,‚Äù said Gurmeet Kaur, a housewife in the area. She raised a steel trapdoor beneath her kitchen floor to reveal a 4000-liter underground tank. When the water runs out, Mrs. Kaur and her neighbors depend on private suppliers, who deliver water in truck-sized tankers, which cost 1,500 rupees ($23.71) in winter and 3,000 rupees ($47.41) in summer.

‚ÄúEvery family here has been given a voter identity card by the government,‚Äù said Anuj Porwal, a student-activist in Sangam Vihar. ‚ÄúBut no one has been given water supply.‚Äù

Activists like Mr. Porwal allege that businessmen working with the ruling Congress party and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) run the private water supply operations through tankers.

‚ÄúOut of the one million people here, 70 per cent live in an area of three square kilometers. The ground water level has fallen drastically because of overuse and it is not possible to provide tube well water for everyone,‚Äù said S.C.L. Gupta, the current lawmaker from Sangam Vihar, who is from the BJP.

Mr. Gupta denies his party workers being part of a ‚Äúwater tanker mafia.‚Äù

‚ÄúI formed eleven committees of around two to three people each. They go to every house and collect 50 rupees for ensuring water is supplied to them,‚Äù Mr. Gupta said. ‚ÄúI know this is not perfectly legal.‚Äù

‚Äú An operation of hundreds of unauthorized water tankers serving the city has resulted in it being labeled as the ‚Äútankermafia.‚Äù

The comptroller‚Äôs report estimated around 4 million people in Delhi do not have piped water supply and rely on tanker water. The Delhi Jal Board, the Delhi government body overseeing the distribution of water in the city, runs 250 water tankers itself and has partially outsourced the supply of water through tankers to three private corporations.

According to the government rules, if a citizen without access to water calls an emergency number of the Delhi Jal Board, it is mandatory for the water board to send a tanker in response within three hours. The phone lines for water tanker supply at the board are eternally clogged and it has created a lucrative business of illegally supplying water to Delhi. An operation of hundreds of unauthorized water tankers serving the city has resulted in it being labeled as the ‚Äútankermafia.‚Äù

Ramanand Sharma is arguably one of the ‚Äútanker kings‚Äù of New Delhi. Mr. Sharma, who runs a private water supply company, Keshav Water Suppliers, out of Kotla Mubarakpur area in south Delhi, serves the posh neighborhoods of the city. He refused to divulge the scale of his operations because his work is unauthorized.

Mr. Sharma entered the business in 2011 and was pleasantly surprised to find it very lucrative. He charges 3,000 rupees ($47.41) for a 5,000-liter tanker in upper middle-class areas, whose residents are willing to pay higher prices for urgent delivery.

‚ÄúWe draw water from outside Delhi, mostly farmhouses in Mehrauli, Najafgarh and Faridabad,‚Äù said Mr. Sharma. ‚ÄúThe police often intercept my tankers. I settle the matter by paying them between 10,000 rupees to 30,000 rupees. The risks are there. But a business is a business, whatever it takes to run it.‚Äù

The business of unauthorized supply of water through private tankers in Delhi is worth millions of dollars. ‚ÄúThese tankers exploit 300 to 500 million gallons a day (MGD) of water from private tube wells in the city. Since no one has done a systemic study on this network and the Delhi Jal Board is unaccountable to the people, the mafia works unhindered,‚Äù said Mr. Thakkar, the activist.

The Delhi government pumps out 818 million gallons of water a day. According to the Indian government auditor, the Delhi Jal Board has installed water meters, which record water usage and bill the customers, only for 37 per cent of the water pumped into the city‚Äôs water pipes.

Nobody knows who uses the remaining 63 per cent of Delhi‚Äôs water. According to the comptroller‚Äôs office, the failure to record and bill almost two-third of Delhi‚Äôs portable, treated water causes annual losses of about $330 million. Between 2009 and 2012, the auditor calculated the losses to be 4,000 rupee crores or roughly $1 billion.

Even if the tanker mafia diverts a fraction of this unrecorded, unbilled water into their business, the black market for water in Delhi would amount to millions of dollars annually.

The tanker mafia succeeds because it fills the vacuum created by the Delhi government‚Äôs inability to provide an essential resource to its citizens.

‚ÄúThis tanker mafia is running right under the nose of the Congress government,‚Äù said Vijay Goel, the Delhi president of the Bharatiya Janata Party. ‚ÄúWe have raised these issues time and again but nothing changes.‚Äù

The Cabinet Committee on Uttarakhand (CCU) approved a package of Rs. 7,346 crore for the flood-ravaged Uttarakhand.

The CCU, which was formed under the Uttarakhand Reconstruction and Rehabilitation plan, held a meeting in New Delhi on Monday under the Chairmanship of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

In the meeting, other than Rs. 7,346 crore, an additional allocation of Rs. 100 crore was made for Uttarakhand.

The additional Rs. 100 crore would be given for the compensation that is being borne by the State government and is being given to the disaster-affected people in the State, even though it does not fall under the National Disaster Response Force‚Äôs (NDRF) guidelines.

Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna has agreed to spend the money on the eight districts in the State other than the flood-ravaged districts of Rudraprayag, Chamoli, Uttarkashi, Bageshwar, and Pithoragarh.

The compensation for the mules that were dead in the flash-floods would be increased from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 50,000. Compensation would also be given for commercial buildings. This will be spent from Rs. 100 crore.

Of the Rs. 7,346 crore package, Rs. 1,885 crore would be given for the Centrally Sponsored Schemes, Rs. 1,200 crore would be given to the NDRF, Rs. 3,161 crore would be spent in externally-aided projects, Rs. 1,100 crore would be given under Special Plan Assistance.

Ms Lekhi was countering the Congress for slamming Mr Modi after media reports said that the Chief Minister of Gujarat had visited Uttarakhand with a team of officials and flew out the next day having ensured the evacuation of 15,000 people from his state.The Congress said Mr Modi's ""Rambo act"" reflected ""the rank opportunism and the sheer desperation to try and politicise and even milk tragedy for political gains."" Mr Modi's opponents have also criticised him for singling out Gujaratis for help.The Congress' Oscar Fernandes today sought to explain how the public appearance of his party's top leaders was different from Mr Modi's parachute act in Uttarakhand. The presence of Mrs Gandhi and Rahul, he said, was only designed to enthuse party workers engaged in relief operations.Mr Modi aggravated the Congress, which governs Uttarakhand, further by tweeting that he had offered to rebuild the holy shrine of Kedarnath, destroyed by the flood.Senior minister Ambika Soni said Mr Modi was not the only Chief Minister to have visited Uttarakhand.

But the situation could get difficult if the rains continue for a few more days,"" GVMC chief engineer B Jayarami Reddy told TOI.However, what is giving the residents of these 13 localities nightmares is the spectre of a repeat of the 2005 incident when flooding due to heavy rains brought the Meghadrigedda waters rushing into several homes and also brought the airport services to a grinding halt for nearly 15 days. In that year, nearly 53,000 cusecs of water of the reservoir, which was commissioned in December 1977, was released into the sea at Naval Dockyard.According to Kona Thatha Rao, former GVMC corporator and resident of Gajuwaka, every rainy season people living in areas such as Vizag Airport, Gajuwaka, Sheelanagar, Kunchumamba Colony, Yerragedda Colony, PN Colony and Narava, Yellapuvanipalem live under the constant threat of floods due to the rising water levels of the Meghadrigedda.Attributing the rising water levels to the poor maintenance of the reservoir, he said the civic authorities have not taken up maintenance works in the last four years. ""Meghadrigedda will not overflow if the GVMC annually takes up maintenance works such as removal of mud, slush and weeds. If it does so, the reservoir's storing capacity will also increase apart from preventing flood like situations in residential localities,"" Thatha Rao said.Spanning an area of 1041.86 million cubic feet, though the Meghadrigedda is one of the smaller water bodies out of the total eight canals and reservoirs that feed the city, it poses a higher risk to public life in case of heavy rains. The Meghadrigedda, that gives GVMC 9 million gallons of water per day, is a prime water source due to continuous rains in its catchment areas, mostly the hill ranges of Narava and Yerrakonda in the Eastern Ghats.GVMC commissioner, MV Satyanarayana said they have already alerted the residents of the residential areas at risk due to the swelling reservoir and urged them to take the help of GVMC. ""We have so far evacuated nearly 100 families to safer places as part of preventive measures,"" civic chief said.When contacted, GVMC superintending engineer for water works D Mariyanna said that they annually pay Rs 20 lakh to the state irrigation department for maintenance works, including removal of mud and silt.

Over two months after Kedarnath shrine was ravaged by devastating floods in Uttarakhand, efforts are on in full swing to ensure that prayers resume by September 11 as planned even as priests say that much will depend on weather conditions.

‚ÄúPreparations are going on. There is a meeting on August 25 in Dehradun to take a final call on whether the prayers can begin on the proposed date as we have to consider the weather conditions also. Everyone wants that prayers begin as early as possible,‚Äù Rawal Bhimshankar Ling, the chief priest of Kedarnath told PTI from Devangere, Karnataka.

Uttarakhand chief minister Vijay Bahuguna had announced earlier this month that prayers will resume from September 11.

A 40-member team consisting of PWD and revenue department personnel reached Kedarnath this week to expedite debris removal exercise and complete other arrangements even as most places across the state were lashed by light to moderate rains.

‚ÄúPrayers will be held with all the rituals. We will perform a purification prayer first which will include havan.

After that the traditional prayer will begin under the guidance of priests,‚Äù said the priest who is in Kanavkuppi math in Devangere, Karnataka for ‚Äòshravan rudrabhishek‚Äô which is dedicated to those who died in Kedarnath tragedy this year.

‚ÄúMany people want to see the prayers but we have to keep the weather conditions and arrangements in mind. Once the prayers get resumed Bagesh Ling, the present priest of Kedarnath temple and other staff will remain there till the doors get closed on November 5,‚Äù he said.

Bagesh Ling, who was inside the temple on the fateful day, is in Ukhimath now and waiting for prayer to get resumed.

‚ÄúWe are collecting all the necessary stuff for purification and traditional puja,‚Äù Bagesh said.

‚ÄúPrayers will be offered to Kaal Bhairav first. Then we will offer Balbhog to Kedarnath, after that there will be Abhishek and Shringar of God and we will offer Mahabhog. There will be a Sampoorna arti in the evening. This is the tradition and will be followed till the doors are closed for winter,‚Äù he said.

He also said that all the idols brought to Ukhimath after the floods will be taken back to Kedarnath.

‚ÄúWe had brought the movable idols of Ganesh, Parvati, Shankar, Kaal Bhairav and Shaligram to Ukhimath but now we will take them back to Kedarnath. After offering bhog to them, the prayers can resume,‚Äù he said.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

As many as eight lakh farmers of Srikakulam district lost all their hopes with heavy heavy rain and floods causing damage to crops in two lakh acres.

There is little chance to save standing crops such as paddy, sugar cane, banana, coconut and other varieties with the rains causing havoc in the district. Almost all the mandals received around 25 cm rainfall till 8.30 am on Thursday

As many as 600 villages were marooned due to floods to Mahendratanaya, Bahuda rivers. It is estimated that around 1.2 lakh people were affected in Itchapuram, Kanchili, Kaviti, Mandasa, Sompeta and Vajrapukotturu mandals.

Train services hit

Rail and road network between AP and Odisha got disrupted as flood water flowing over the track in Itchapuram. Many trains were either delayed or cancelled. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Itchapuram, Palasa and Srikakulam stations. East Coast Railway authorities are trying to restore tracks in many areas. The train movement will begin only after thorough inspection of the route.

Vehicular movement was disrupted with flood water flowing heavily on highways too. Following breach to causeway near Chapara, road network between Parlakimidi and Meliyaputti got disrupted. Life was thrown completely out of gear in Sompeta, Vajrapukotturu, and Kanchili areas as rain water entered houses.

The district administration tried to provide water and food packets to flood victims.

Collector Saurabh Gaur monitored the flood situation and asked all the special officers to be alert till normalcy was restored in the affected villages.

Review meet

He conducted a review meeting at the Collectorate and directed health teams to reach flood affected areas to check outbreak of prevent communicable diseases. The Collector declared holiday for schools and colleges in the district on Thursday.

Mr.Gaur said there was no human loss in the flood affected areas. However, the situation was grim in Jagannadhapuram, Patasasanam, Birlangi and Totavooru of Itchapuram mandal. The irrigation officials requested their counter parts in Odisha not to release water from Balagatti Dam since it would further inundate many areas of Itchapuram.

The situation was reportedly to be grim in Vajrapukotturu mandal as Bhimasamudram Gedda and Padmanabham Gedda are in spate. Mandasa-Haripuram villages were also badly affected.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Technology-driven efforts are on to crowdsource information using the Internet and other communication channels and integrate it into online maps to help manage the aftermath of the natural calamity that has beset Uttarakhand.

The international experience in recent years has proved that ‚Äòcrisis mapping‚Äô can make a difference to disaster situations.

One such Uttarakhand flood relief effort, that aims to make use of ‚Äòdigital volunteers‚Äô in India and other parts of the world to aggregate information from diverse sources and make it more useful and actionable has been launched by Hemant Purohit, a Crisis-Response Coordination researcher at the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis), Wright State University.

And there exists an International Network of Crisis Mappers, which includes members with different skill sets, and experience in the use of tools covering crowdsourcing, mapping, use of aerial and satellite imagery, geospatial platforms, advanced visualisation and computational and statistical models.

What the volunteers are doing is to monitor different channels of information on Uttarakhand, including official sources, blogs, social media, non-governmental organisations, public networks and the news media to generate ‚Äòsituation reports‚Äô and also update with vital information an online crisis map set up by the >Google Crisis Response team (http://google.org/crisismap/2013-uttrakhand-floods? gl=in). The map has information on rescued people, cleared areas, people stranded, relief camps, medical centres, road networks and so on.

Information flow will gather momentum as the repair and restoration of the mobile phone network progresses in Uttarakhand.

Google had also set up an instance of its webapp, Person Finder, that makes it possible for information about missing persons to be posted online and searched, with the option of triggering alerts.

The role of crisis mapping was to bridge the gap that existed between information-seekers and providers, particularly when it came to providing insights into the situation on the ground and the action that needed to be taken, Mr. Purohit said in an e-mail interview to The Hindu .

Haiti earthquake

The world got a glimpse of the potential of crowdsourced mapping following the deployment of an open-source platform called Ushahidi when an earthquake hit Haiti in 2010. The information provided by the affected population and others over the Internet and the mobile phone network and the map-based capabilities of the platform helped in addressing specific disaster management requirements.

In the case of the Haiti earthquake, a volunteer team got the platform going fast and were soon tapping into social media sources like Twitter, facebook, and blogs and other media to create actionable reports. Later an international SMS number was created for people to input information relating to the quake. Soon it turned into a flood which was painstakingly processed by volunteers and turned into information that could be loaded onto an online map.

As many as 4,636 project volunteers translated 25,186 SMSs and numerous e-mails, web, and social media communications, resulting in 3,596 reports that were actionable and included enough relevant information to be mapped on Ushahidi, said a United States Institute of Peace report.

Now the trend was to try to use automation to process such large volumes of information.

‚ÄúUntil recently, much of our crisis response and disaster coordination relied on manual effort using web infrastructure. Ushahidi is an excellent and successful example. More recently, there is rapid progress on our ability to use automation ‚Äî especially in processing large amount of information shared on social media,‚Äù said Amit P. Sheth, director, Kno.e.sis Center. ‚ÄúWe are at a stage where we should combine human effort with machine processing,‚Äù he said.",solution,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 28, 2013",Uttarakhand,200 mm,USD 3 billion,"5,700","Destruction of infrastructure, loss of livelihoods, displacement of people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

As many as 33,152 persons have been moved to safer areas in massive relief and rescue operations launched by the Central and state governments in the last few days to tackle the unprecedented situation caused by flash floods.

""The Air Force has deployed 13 more aircraft taking the number of aircraft for relief and rescue operations to 43,"" I&B Minister Manish Tewari told reporters here.

He said the Railways was also operating special trains from Dehradun to Delhi, Ambala and Lucknow to ferry stranded pilgrims and tourists.

Tewari said the Railways along with the Uttarakhand government has also offered to send all stranded passengers free of cost to their respective destinations.

The Indian Air Force has deployed its heavylift Mi-26 helicopters to transport fuel and heavy equipment required by the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) to clear roads closed due to landslide.

The IAF has also activated advanced landing grounds at Dharasu and Gaucher and set up an airbridge to evacuate stranded persons.

Besides the Army, personnel of the Sashastra Seema Bal, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, National Disaster Relief Force, BRO have been engaged in search, rescue and relief efforts.

Efforts were also on to operationalise 207 mobile towers of 739 such installations in the three affected districts of Chamoli, Rudraprayag and Uttarkashi.

As many as 207 mobile towers in the three districts were knocked down by the fury of the floods.

Petroleum Ministry has set up aircraft refuelling centres at Rampur, Shimla and Gaucher and efforts were being made to make available LPG cylinders to people in affected areas.

""Trucks carrying LPG cylinders have been despatched from refuelling depots at Haridwar and Haldwani on June 17, 18 and 19,"" Tewari said, adding supply of motor spirit, diesel and superior kerosene oil was also being augmented.

He said in the affected districts of Chamoli, Rudraprayag and Uttarkashi, 209 of a total of 739 mobile towers are down and they are likely to be made operational in the next 24 hours.

""Emergency services like 100, 101, 102, 108 are all operational. This includes not only BSNL, but also private telecom operators,"" Tewari said.

Department of Telecom has also issued instructions to all telecom companies that the toll free public utility emergency numbers must be operational and accessible to customers in affected areas by this evening.

Tewari also brushed aside suggestions that VVIPs touring the areas were creating hurdles in the rescue efforts being mounted using aircraft.

""Whatever is humanly possible is being done,"" Tewari said.

To a poser on whether like Congress he expects other political parties to donate a month's salary of their MPs and MLAs for Uttarakhand relief fund, he said he would leave it to their discretion.

Narrow valleys in mountainous northern India, where shrines had lured tens of thousands of Sikh and Hindu pilgrims, remained cut off five days after torrents surged through rocky canyons. Helicopters continued to drop supplies in Uttarakhand state after roads were swept away.

As many as 556 dead bodies have been recovered and more may be buried under debris, CNN-IBN television channel reported on Friday citing Vijay Bahuguna, chief minister of Uttarakhand.

I have come here to review the situation, home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde told reporters today as he visited the region. We are having regular meeting over the crisis situation. Our paramilitary forces are carrying out relief operation.

So far, about 34,000 people have been evacuated and efforts are continuing to rescue those still stranded, he said on Friday in New Delhi.

While the monsoon causes destruction across India every year, the rains moved over the country with record speed in 2013. Downpours channeled by steep-sided and deforested valleys have generated especially violent floods, washing away homes, vehicles and mobile-phone towers. Television networks have broadcast footage of buildings collapsing into raging rivers and village streets filled with debris and rocks.

Donations sought

Sonia Gandhi, president of the ruling Congress party, called on all national and state lawmakers in her party to donate a month‚Äôs salary to help those affected by the floods, Ajay Maken, a senior Congress leader, wrote on his Twitter page.

The Indian Air Force has deployed 43 aircraft, federal information and broadcasting minister Manish Tewari, told reporters in New Delhi on Friday. Shashidhar Reddy, vice chairman of the national disaster management authority, said 20 June that as many as 1,000 people may have died.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on 19 June the number of casualties is expected to rise as he announced a Rs1000 crore ($167 million) relief package.

Religious shrines in Uttarakhand, which abuts India‚Äôs border with China to the west of Nepal, attract Hindu and Sikh pilgrims each summer. With a population of about 10 million, the state has received almost four times the usual rainfall this month, causing rivers to burst their banks.

The nation‚Äôs army and air force have deployed more than 8,000 troops, including medical teams and engineers, to clear roads blocked by landslides and construct temporary bridges to help reach survivors.

Vital to farms

India‚Äôs monsoon accounts for about 70% of the rainfall vital to the country‚Äôs agriculture-driven economy. Rains since the monsoon began 1 June have been 42% above average, helping to ease water shortages in some regions and promising to boost crop production in the world‚Äôs second-most populous country.

In 2007, more than 2,800 people were killed by monsoon rains during India‚Äôs June-September wet season. As many as 50 million people were affected by floods that destroyed 1.6 million homes in the four-month monsoon period. The United Nations described the flood as the worst in living memory.

The Army on Sunday evacuated all 1,000 stranded pilgrims in the mountain folds around Jungle Chatti in Kedar Valley.

Using cliff assault techniques, skilled mountain rescue troops of Army evacuated 460 by foot through one of the most dangerous Zones in Kedar Valley. The pilgrims were given food, fresh water, medical aid, blankets and plastic sheets at Gauri Kund Army Camp before further evacuation to Sonprayag.

Launching two columns simultaneously from Dharasu and Barkot, Army reached Hanuman Chetti yesterday and surged towards Janak Chatti and Yamunotri this morning and evacuated all stranded pilgrims from Yamunotri.

Army launched Phase 3 of 'Surya Hope' today which would focus on contingency plan of evacuating people by road from the hubs at Harsil, Gauri Kund and Badrinath. Inclement weather conditions did not stop Army from continuing its operations both with helicopters and ground troops.

Army helicopters were pressed into service by afternoon at Govindghat and Jungle Chatti. Evacuation was completed within a short span of time due to continuous and relentless efforts.

Army also air lifted hygiene and sanitation stores and chemicals, blankets, food packets and medicines. More than 3,000 Kgs have been dumped at major rescue centres. Two medical aid centres each have been opened at Gaurikund, Goucher, Joshimath and Harsil.

With the launch of Burma Bridge across Alaknanda River at Lam Bagar on Joshimath - Bardrinath road, it is now possible for pilgrims to be evacuated by foot from Badrinath to Govindghat. Vehicular movement is already underway between Govindghat and Joshimath.

More than 1,300 people have been motivated by the Army to move on foot cum vehicles along the 74 Km stretch of road from Harsil to Uttarkashi. While the intra land slide sectors would be by vehicles, land slides per se will be negotiated on foot. Two administrative and logistics staging areas have been set up at Sukhi and Gangnani for the benefit of people travelling by road.

The C130 J aircraft undertook a weather recce mission in the morning based on which the IAF helicopters started operation in Harsil Sector and another one carried fuel.

NAGPUR: Over 100 survivors of the Kedarnath floods returned home to Nagpur and nearby towns on Sunday. There were emotional scenes on the platform as relatives hugged each other tearfully and distributed sweets to passers-by.""We have faced death and reached Nagpur. It was a harrowing experience,"" said Kishor Singh Bais, who was in tears as he hugged his mother and children.""We saw apocalypse with our eyes,"" said his wife Kiran, who was consoling her three children.Ravi Bokade was waiting for his 58-year-old mother Tulsabai and others. ""There was no contact for three to four days, and we were scared to death,"" said Manoj Miske, whose parents had organized the tour for the group to Kedarnath.Recalling their traumatic experiences, many survivors said the scenes give them nightmares. Himanshu Nimje told TOI, ""We saw bodies floating in the river , hanging on trees on the mountains. It was a macabre scene. Later, we even saw some uniformed men throwing bodies into the river.""Almost all the people who came back lamented about the apathy of the Uttarakhand government during the tragedy. We have been saved due to our own efforts, said most survivors. ""There was no relief from the government and people there were looting us. We had to buy one paratha for Rs 80 and a water bottle for Rs 100,"" said Manisha Gupta, who returned by Andhra Pradesh Express with a group of about 40, which also included children.Another traveller in the group, Anil Singh Tomar, however had a different tale to tell. ""In contrast to other stories of inhuman behaviour, I found people who were really helpful. Our experience was traumatizing but wherever we went people helped us.""Yuvraj Yadav of Sitabuldi, who had gone with three friends , slammed the Indian Army and ITBP for their shoddy rescue work. ""All the images on TV present a false picture. The army dropped 15 bags of food for about 500 people, that too only once in four days that I was in Gaurikund area. We spent two days practically without food at an army base,"" he told TOI.Laxminarayan Kawale had taken a group of 30 pilgrims from Kamptee, Hingna and other towns. He was dead tired when he reached the city on Sunday evening on the Dakshin Express. He is disgusted with the rapacious behaviour of locals. ""The driver we persuaded to bring us back to Rishikesh from Gaurikund was demanding Rs 50,000. Thankfully, some charitable organizations intervened,"" he said.There is a ray of hope for Nagpurians whose relatives are missing from Gaurikund. A government officer told TOI that some people rescued from Gaurikund on Sunday told Uttarakhand authorities that some people from Nagpur were waiting to be evacuated from a village. However, they could not provide their names. Eight Nagpurians who had gone missing near Badrinath were rescued on Sunday. One of them is Subhash Patne.A fifteen-year-old pilgrim from Risod (district Washim) died for want of food and water in Rambada (near Kedarnath). Pradyumna Toshniwal had gone with his parents on Chardham Yatra. Realizing that the boy's condition was worsening, his father Purushottam offered Rs 1 lakh to a local to arrange for food and water. However, the local vanished with the money.Seeing their son dying of hunger in front of their eyes was too much for Purushottam and his wife Surekha. They stopped eating and fainted on the fifth day. Fortunately, an army helicopter reached Rambada that day and airlifted them to Gauchar, where they were force fed at the hospital.Around 50 pilgrims from Nagpur and nearby towns were still untraceable till Sunday evening.

delhi,2013,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/z6LB7ajvmMm1c2ocqjjmeK/Debate-deepens-on-construction-activity.html,01-Jul-13,Uttarakhand floods: Debate deepens on construction activity,"New Delhi: The disaster in Uttarakhand may have been a result of climate change, worsened by the impact of rampant development projects, say experts.

About 900 have died and 3,000 are missing, according to official figures, in one of the worst natural disasters the country has had to deal with.

Many experts say the disaster is man-made and warn that it might not be the last to hit the fragile Himalayan ecosystem because of rampant and unplanned development in the region.

Environmentalists do not rule out the possibility of the flash floods having links to climate change. But they also say the construction of about 70 hydropower projects in the hill state, underground tunnels, roads, and the encroachments of riverbeds by buildings, coupled with deforestation, could have worsened the impact.

The primary blame, according to Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, a not-for-profit organization, falls on the vast construction of hydropower projects on the rivers in the region.

‚ÄúThroughout their life cycle, from construction, deforestation, blasting, mining, obtaining materials from the riverbed for construction, muck disposal, debris dumping, damming, altering hydrological cycle to allied activities like colonies, roads, infrastructure development, hydropower plants have a profound impact on geology and hydrology of the region,"" he said.

Thakkar, who has been opposing the construction of dams in the country without cumulative environment impact assessments being conducted for these, said it would not be correct to determine the impact of any single project on an area when multiple hydro projects are coming up in a fragile ecosystem such as the Himalayas.

The Wildlife Institute of India in a 2012 report recommended the shelving of 24 projects in the upper Ganga region due to their potential high impact on the ecology. It said the projects affected nearly 10,000 hectares of land, with more than 3,600 hectares of forests being submerged.

Besides, the environment ministry has delayed deciding on a draft river regulation zone (RRZ) for over three years. The aim of the RRZ is to regulate construction and development near rivers, just as the coastal zone regulation is for regulating development near coastal and sea areas. ‚ÄúThe RRZ notification could have helped in controlling infrastructure development like hotels and homes along the river,"" said Thakkar.

India must evolve a right mix of ecological and growth and development balance, according to M. Shashidhar Reddy, vice-chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority. ‚ÄúOur policy should be such that everything should be subject to an environmental impact assessment. Lots of departments have learnt lessons and all of those need to be put together,"" he said over the phone.

The carrying capacity of fragile ecosystems such as the Himalayas should also be considered, he said.

Thakkar said the expert appraisal committee for approving environment clearance to hydropower projects had not rejected a single one in the hill state since its inception six years ago.

Preparedness for such a disaster could have made a difference, said Sudhir K. Jain, director, Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar. ‚ÄúPreparedness has a simple rule: has everyone done what they were supposed to do? And if they haven‚Äôt, then that is not acceptable,"" he said over the phone.

Jain, who specializes in earthquake engineering, said India has a several areas that are prone to earthquakes, but cities are not being developed based on that. ‚ÄúWe are not doing enough to ensure new constructions are safe. We must ensure that new constructions are as per correct procedure,"" he said.

In the case of Uttarakhand, the landslide management and stormwater drain systems should have been better, he said.

India should evolve a pan-Himalayan development strategy based on each state‚Äôs natural resources, culture and traditional knowledge, said Sunita Narain, director general of the Centre for Science and Environment, an advocacy group. ‚ÄúWe also know that climate change will exacerbate the vulnerability of this already-fragile ecosystem,"" Narain said.

Misery and uncertainty continued to plague thousands of villagers rendered homeless in the interior areas of Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Pithoragarh even as teams of the Army, ITBP, NDRF and State police rescued over 10,000 pilgrims on Sunday. The remaining 7,000 odd pilgrims would be rescued soon, authorities hope.

The rescue operations were hampered by mild showers in places like Dehradun and Joshimath. The Met office has predicted more rains on Monday and Tuesday.

The Director General of Police has ordered all local police chiefs to escort pilgrims trekking their way out to avoid mishaps. Special security would be provided to women, he said.

Many pilgrims and residents wondered why the government had not made proper arrangements for the Char Dham Yatra even after 12 years of formation of Uttarakhand. Disasters due to cloudbursts, flash floods and landslides have been common but the authorities seemed content with small temporary measures after each disaster, said Renu D. Singh of the Samadhan Women Helpline.

Sarita and Neetu, both social activists, wondered why neither the Bharatiya Janata Party nor the Congress allowed the Vidhan Sabha sessions to function. ‚ÄúImportant Bills and even the Budget are passed without discussions. Does the electorate elect the MLAs for this,‚Äù they asked.

Jagdish Chandra Jakhmola, a retired teacher, wanted the MLAs not to disturb Vidhan Sabha proceedings and seriously debate how disasters could be mitigated in Uttarakhand. The Centre should also make efforts by forming a group of well meaning experts to suggest measures to minimise losses caused by natural calamities and also pitch in with liberal funds for repairing or reinforcing infrastructure, he said.

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, after consulting with religious leaders such as Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati, ordered the officials to immediately send a team to Kedarnath to clear the area of debris and cremate the dead bodies lying there with traditional rituals after postmortem and collection of DNA samples. A ‚Äòmahayagya‚Äô will be held in Haridwar on the 13th day of the tragedy for the peace of the departed souls, Mr. Bahuguna said.

Mr. Bahuguna also said the rehabilitation of Kedarnath shrine was a top priority of the gand it will be carried out after taking suggestions from the Archaeological Survey of India.

Mr. Bahuguna said that the welfare of the disaster-hit villagers was equally important and necessary rations and medical care was being rushed there. ‚ÄúThe damaged roads and bridges were making access to the remote areas difficult,‚Äù he said.

Second survey

Mr. Bahuguna ordered the rescue teams to make a second survey of areas from where pilgrims had been rescued to make sure no one was left out. The Chief Minister wanted the officials to keep a backup rescue plan ready in view of forecasts of more rains in the coming days.

Union Minister Harish Rawat, who trekked about 18 km from Rudraprayag to Augustmuni on Sunday morning, told The Hindu over phone that devastation in the villages was extensive and it would take a lot of time to bring things back to normal. Mr. Rawat who visited Gauchar also said the ITBP was doing an excellent job in the village-to-village search for survivors in the Kedarnath-Lambagarh area. A large number of houses, hotels, vehicles and agriculture fields have been washed away, Mr. Rawat said.

Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, along with senior Congress leaders Moti Lal Vora and Ambika Soni, reviewed the relief centres set up in Rishikesh and Dehradun.

Mr. Hooda said that 50,000 blankets would be sent for people stranded at various place in Uttarakhand and, out of these, 25,000 blankets had already been dispatched from Panipat on Sunday. He said that buses of Haryana Roadways had been deployed to carry rescued persons from Dehradun, Rishikesh and Haridwar to their destinations free of cost.

The Baluakot and Jualjiwi villages in district Pithoragarh were some of the worst-affected with some of the villagers trekking through hazardous areas to the district headquarters and taking shelter in the homes of relatives or friends. Pramod Tamta who reached the district headquarters said that nearly half of the houses, shops and agricultural fields in Baluakot and Jualjiwi had been washed away.

Heart-rending scenes could be witnessed at the Sahasradhara helipad and Jolly Grant Airport in Dehradun where hundreds of relatives could be seen frantically showing photographs of their kin to the rescued pilgrims, asking them if they had seen their loved ones.",,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 23, 2013","Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Pithoragarh",200 mm,"1000+ houses, hotels, vehicles and agriculture fields washed away","5,700+","Thousands of pilgrims and villagers stranded, many missing",The floods were caused by a cloudburst that triggered landslides and flash floods in the Kedarnath valley.

India's government offered millions of dollars to states hit by drought or floods, marking half the funds for a western zone were millions face their worst water shortage since 1972.

India's government on Wednesday offered millions of dollars to states hit by drought or floods, marking half the funds for a western zone were millions face their worst water shortage since 1972.

Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar said a federal ministerial panel which he headed agreed to dole out nearly 29 billion rupees ($532 million) to seven states which last year faced drought, flooding or other natural disasters.

""We have approved the relief package, which is the highest in recent years,"" Pawar said and added the panel agreed to hand out 12 billion rupees to drought-stricken Maharashtra, his home state in western India.

""The drought situation in Maharashtra is the worst seen in the last 40 years,"" Pawar said, according to the Press Trust of India (PTI).

The minister also promised additional help to the parched region, where suicide by debt-ridden farmers is also rampant.

Millions in some 10,000 parched villages in the western state were affected by the 2012 drought, officials reports say.

Last year's searing drought in Maharashtara is blamed on two successive poor monsoons in the region while others say a public policy failure also deepened the crisis for thousands of small growers.

Gujarat and Kerala states would also get drought relief, PTI said and added cash would be doled out also to Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Uttarkhand to tackle disruptions from floods, landslides or excessive rains.

With nearly three-quarters of Indians dependent on rural incomes, the yearly monsoon is a lifeline‚Äîespecially given that about two-thirds of farmland is not irrigated and depends entirely on seasonal rain.

The 1972 drought led to a massive shortage of food grains and commodity prices spiked, forcing New Delhi to jack up imports, while another crippling drought in 2009 also inflated prices and hardship.

The helicopters ferried rescue workers and doctors along with equipment, food and medicine to Kedarnath in the state of Uttrakhand, the nearest town to those trapped in the valley, said Air Commodore Rajesh Prasad, who is overseeing the operations.

Amit Chandola, a state spokesman, said authorities so far have been unable to reach eight villages feared washed away by the weekend floods in the worst-hit districts of Rudraprayag and Chamoli.

He said the official death in Uttrakhand is 104 but added, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know yet what happened to hundreds of people living there.‚Äù An additional 17 people died in collapsed homes in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state, said R.L. Vishwakarma, a state police officer.

A joint army and air force operation has so far evacuated nearly 13,000 people stranded in the area but nearly 62,000 people remained cut off, officials said.

The flooding washed away roads and nearly two dozen bridges, demolished 365 houses and partially damaged 275 others in Uttrakhand, the state government said. Most of those stranded are Hindu pilgrims who were visiting four revered shrines.

Hundreds of distressed people looking for relatives flocked to Dehradun, the state capital, where flood survivors were taken by plane and helicopter. As those rescued exited the aircraft, those searching for missing people showed them pictures of their loved ones in hopes that someone had seen them.

The lucky ones spoke to their stranded relatives on the phone Wednesday and were waiting for them to be rescued.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who made an aerial survey of the region Wednesday, said the death toll exceeded 100. ‚ÄúIt is feared that the loss of life could be much higher,‚Äù he said.

State Chief Minister Vihay Bahuguna said the Kedarnath temple ‚Äì one of the holiest Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, located atop the Garhwal Himalayan range ‚Äì had escaped major damage, but up to 10 feet (4 metres) of debris covered the area around it.

The state received 380 millimeters (14 inches) of rain in the past week, nearly five times the average for that time period, said R.P.N. Singh, India‚Äôs junior home minister.

Air force spokeswoman Priya Joshi said 30 helicopters and aircraft have dropped food packets and other relief supplies in addition to ferrying stranded tourists. More than 5,000 soldiers helped bring thousands of homeless people to relief camps and provided them with food and medical supplies.

The latest rains have affected several states and the capital, New Delhi, where nearly 2,000 people were evacuated to government-run camps on higher ground. Authorities there said the Yamuna River was expected to start receding Thursday afternoon.

As 1,000 more stranded people were evacuated from Badrinath and Harshil sectors by air and road, air chief marshal N.A.K. Browne, on a morale-boosting mission to Uttarakhand after the Indian Air Force (IAF) chopper crash, pledged to continue rescue efforts and hoped to wrap it up in the next few days.

‚ÄúThe cremation of bodies in Kedarnath which was being put off again and again for the past two days (Monday and Tuesday) due to bad weather was finally taken up this afternoon,"" IAS officer Ravinath Raman told PTI from Guptkashi. The temple town of Kedarnath was the epicentre of destruction. The number of bodies cremated were not immediately known.

Around 3,500 people are still waiting to be evacuated from Harsil and Badrinath areas, an Indian Army release said. Around 100,000 stranded people have been rescued so far since the disaster struck the hill state on 15 June.

Browne said if the IAF, which is part of the multi-agency operations that also included the army, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the National Disaster Management Authority, got three- four days of good weather, it will be able to complete its mission.

‚ÄúIf the weather starts improving by Friday or so, then by Monday, Tuesday we should have all this (task) finished,"" he told reporters in Gauchar, the forward base for the rescue choppers.

‚ÄúThe operations are going to continue. In fact, most of the work has already been done. It is now a question of getting the people out from Badrinath and the Harsil sector,"" he said, adding, ‚ÄúOur rotors will not stop churning. That means, we will continue with the job till get the people out.""

Uttarakhand chief minister Vijay Bahuguna said people stranded in the Harsil and Badrinath areas will be rescued in the next two days if the weather remains conducive to flights and all steps were being taken to prevent epidemic outbreak in the flood-affected regions.

NDMA vice-chairman M. Shashidhar Reddy said there is a high possibility of the death toll climbing.

‚ÄúThere is 10ft high debris in Kedarnath and we fear that several bodies are trapped,"" he said.

Reddy said that nearly 350 people remained untraceable, raising fears that all of them are dead.

According to official figures, so far 822 people have lost their lives in the natural disaster in Uttarakhand. PTI
