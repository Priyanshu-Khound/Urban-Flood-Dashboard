0,539,chennai,2023,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/why-chennai-floods/articleshow/106280388.cms,3 weeks ago,Why Chennai floods,"Unlike most cities, Chennai has three rivers — Kosasthalaiyar, Cooum, and Adyar — and the Buckingham Canal to carry floodwaters to the sea. Yet, the city floods every time it rains heavily. Thousands of crores of rupees have been spent on building drains, but these cannot compensate for the loss of lakes, floodplains and channels to unchecked encroachments.The British protected the city’s waterways with strict laws.The Tamil Nadu Rivers Conservancy Act of 1884, for example, ensured no development for at least 80metres from both banks of rivers and around waterbodies. Even before that conservation was practised through kudimaramathu (community involvement in waterbody upkeep) and setting apart of floodplains around rivers (aathu poramboke), lakes (eri poramboke) and canals (odai poramboke). Most of these have vanished.In the ‘tank memoirs’, the British recorded details of waterbodies in Chennai in the 18th and 19th centuries. “It was intended to levy cess on landowners for use of water for irrigation, but it protected the waterbodies,” says S Janakarajan in his book Water Management in Rural South India and Sri Lanka.From the 1960s, however, rapid urbanisation and unplanned growth played havoc with the waterbodies. “The rules were diluted; encroachments on river banks got pattas,” said professor A Ramachandran, professor emeritus, Centre for Climate Change and Disaster Management, Anna University.All the unapproved house layouts before 1989 were regularised by the Tamil Nadu government. After the 2015 flood, a CAG audit report said that between 1989 and 2016, the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority approved 195 colonies on 175 hectares that were actually part of 54 waterbodies. The report said the number of colonies on water bodies could be higher as the CMDA had no monitoring mechanism.Chennai’s biggest tragedy is what it has done to the Pallikaranai marshland, which was recently designated a Ramsar site. The marsh is now just a little more than 10% of its original 5,500 hectares. A 2017 CAG report blamed the development of the IT corridor on OMR for the marshland’s demise.The marshland is a sponge that soaks up water, but its nature is changing because of encroachments and influx of sewage. The government has also set up an 80.9hectare garbage dump in the marsh.The residential colonies in Velachery, Madipakkam, Perungudi, Perumbakkam and Pallikaranai that went under in early December have all come up on the marsh or in its vicinity.“We have not learned lessons from the 2015 floods. Encroachments on water bodies have not been removed. The state government should have retrieved more areas of Pallikaranai marshland and revived its connections with 32 tanks in south Chennai. This could have reduced the floods in Madipakkam, Pallikaranai and Velachery. Buckingham Canal also has not been deepened before the monsoon.It could have increased the floodwater carrying capacity,” said professor L Venkatachalam, officiating director, Madras Institute of Development Studies. The depth of the Buckingham Canal was six feet below mean sea level when it was built; the current depth is three feet above sea level due to siltation, according to WRD. “Each lake would have a kalangal (surplus channel) through which water flowed to the next tank. We must recover the kalangals. The bunds of lakes must be strengthened and the waterbodies deepened to hold more water,” said Sekhar Raghavan, director of Rain Centre.What has happened to the marsh – encroachments reducing its ability to hold water – has also happened to the Buckingham Canal, which flows across Chennai parallel to the coast before emptying into the sea at Kovalam. Now the Greater Chennai Corporation and the water resources department plan to lay pipes at 15 locations to drain water from Buckingham Canal to the sea. “We will create a pipe-based drainage system from B-canal directly into the sea with shutters and permanent pumps. This will reduce the water-load going into the four basins, and ease flooding in the core city,” said GCC chief engineer S Rajendiran.However, he said, high-power pumps would have to be set up at various places to push out water. These include Kasimedu, Napier Bridge, Loop Road and outfalls draining from Pallikaranai. “Shutters will prevent seawater from coming in,” he said.Areas in north Chennai such as Manali and Thiruvottiyur faced inundation because the Kosasthalaiyar breached near Sadaiyankuppam. Water at 45,000 cusecs (cubic feet per second) was discharged from Poondi reservoir on December 4. Vyasarpadi, Pulianthope and Korukkupet flooded due to poor gradient of stormwater drains as the water did not flow even after three days.While this was water from ‘outside’ flooding the city, there were also instances where the city’s ‘own’ water inundated the areas, said Sekhar Raghavan. “People fail to use the water from shallow aquifers because many have closed their open wells, resorting to borewells that tap water from deep aquifers,” he said. If people use open wells, flood waters will recede faster. People can install borewells with slotted casing instead of straight casing to connect both the shallow and deep aquifers.Retired professor of urban engineering, Anna University, K P Subramanian said the government should come up with a classification of objectionable and nonobjectionable lands, as per the 2004 guidelines given by the ministry of housing and urban affairs in 2004. “The guidelines said floodplains, waterways, parks, playgrounds, and open spaces should be noconstruction zones. The state has to identify settlements in such areas and create policies to rehabilitate people,” he said.A 2021 CAG report, released this year, said the number of untenable slums in water bodies increased by 91% between 2014 and 2018, from 235 to 451. The numbers reflected on the state’s poor housing policies, it said.“Decentralization of the city is the only way forward. People come here for jobs and labour. Chennai is a ticking time-bomb and it cannot accommodate more houses,” said Subramanian. Extreme rainfall events will be more frequent and intense, exacerbated by climate change, said Ramachandran.“The east coast of the country will face more rain because of the El Nino effect,” he said. With climate change and the temperature of the sea surface rising, the intensity of cyclones will be greater, he added. “LiDAR instrument can give a more accurate weather forecast than the current model used by IMD. But it is more expensive,” said Ramachandran.The Union ministry’s Central Water Commission has recommended that the WRD set up dam inflow forecasting systems to ensure better decision-making on water release from reservoirs. “Usually, there is indecisiveness on when to open and close floodgates as Chembarambakkam is a drinking water source. Understanding inflow from catchments can help in releasing water in small amounts in a phased manner,” said Ramachandran.",issue,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city and suburbs,494 mm (19.4 in),"Rs. 10,000 crore",464,18 lakh people were displaced,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage, and encroachments on water bodies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

WHY IS IT RAINING SO MUCH IN TAMIL NADU?

The Tamil Nadu State Disaster Management Authority (TNSDMA) reported that Chennai district received an average rainfall of 400 mm over two days between December 3-5.

The heavy precipitation was attributed to a low-pressure system in the Bay of Bengal, evolving into the Severe Cyclonic Storm ""Michaung,"" that made landfall near Andhra Pradesh's Bapatla.

Kalyanapattinum in Thoothukudi district experienced an unprecedented 950 mm of rainfall in 24 hours, surpassing the region's annual average.

We'd like two minutes of your time in order to understand you better. Please take this reader survey.

A cyclonic circulation originating in the southwest Bay of Bengal gradually moved towards southern Tamil Nadu, resulting in torrential rain in the affected districts.

FIRST URBAN FLOOD MITIGATION PROJECT

In response to the Chennai flooding caused by Cyclone Michaung, Prime Minister Narendra Modi sanctioned the first urban flood mitigation project, worth Rs 562.20 crore.

This project, under the National Disaster Management Fund (NDMF), focuses on 'Integrated Urban Flood Management activities for Chennai Basin'.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, after conducting an aerial survey of the rain-ravaged areas in Chennai, asserted that both the Central and state governments were implementing measures to effectively respond to and mitigate the flood crisis in the city.

CONTRAST IN RAIN ACROSS TAMIL NADU DISTRICTS

December's rainfall in Tamil Nadu exhibited significant variation among districts, with 13 experiencing excess rain (over 60% above normal), 11 facing large deficiencies, and five encountering deficiencies ranging from 59% to 20% below normal levels.

In October and November, the farmers in the Cauvery peninsular district staged protests for releasing of water as it was reported that there was a severe deficit of water in the state. However, the Cauvery water sharing between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have been going on for decades.

Tamil Nadu is no stranger to flood situations and facing a lack of rain.

HISTORICAL FLOODS

The recent deluge in December adds to a series of flood-related challenges faced by Tamil Nadu. In 2015, Chennai witnessed heavy rainfall that inundated large sections of the city, claiming the lives of at least 290 people. Deaths due to rain-related incidents have continued in subsequent years, with 2021 witnessing 18 casualties in Nilgiris districts.

Cyclone Nivar in November 2020 and other instances have left low-lying areas marooned and resulted in fatalities. Tamil Nadu, no stranger to flood situations, faces the ongoing challenge of managing rainfall deficits and mitigating the impact of extreme weather events.

Chennai and its neighboring districts are still reeling from the devastation of cyclone Michaung when a second major deluge, this time paralysing four districts in southern Tamil Nadu, slammed the State. A severe weather forecast remains in place for the next 24 hours in these regions. Road and rail communication to many parts of Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, and Tenkasi have been completely cut off. State officials interviewed by this correspondent admitted that while they had received predictions of heavy rainfall, they lacked specific information about the intensity of the storm from any agency. Consequently, most relief efforts only began after the full force of the downpour became apparent on December 18.

Almost every household in Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, and Thenkasi has been impacted by the relentless torrents of rain that have lashed the region since December 15. However, the worst was yet to come on the night of December 17, when rainfall records were shattered in as many as 39 locations across the four districts.

“The major towns, Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi are literally floating,” said a journalist stationed in Tirunelveli. “Some places away from the river [Thamirabharani] are fine, but any settlement close to the river is inundated,” he added. Most roads to Tirunelveli were cut off by morning while flight and train traffic to Thoothukudi came to a halt by December 17 night.

An official involved in relief in Nagercoil said that ‘unprecedented’ is a word that is being used every new week, with every fresh spell of rain. “Nagercoil is used to heavy spells of rain, but many places in Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli have not seen this kind of rain anytime,” the official added.

In the 24 hours ending at 8.30 am on December 18, 18 stations in Tirunelveli recorded an average of 55.82 mm rainfall. The highest was in Nalumukku with 169 mm and the lowest in Nambiyar Dam, with 9 mm. As many as four stations recorded over 100 mm rainfall. Though stations in Thoothukudi did not record as much rainfall, the fact that Thootukudi is downstream of Tirunelveli, sunk the entire district.

As if this was not enough, from 8.30 am of December 18, rains have been lashing Thoothukudi, and at least four stations have recorded over 400 mm of rain. All schools and other educational institutions are shut and will be used as relief centres.

Thamirabarani River, the lifeline of Tenkasi, Tirunelveli, and Thoothukudi districts, breached its banks in most places, and it seemed like the river was spread over a kilometre in most places—not one spot along the river was spared. Vaippar, another minor river, is flowing near its highest flood level. Every small river and tributary turned lethal water streams across the four districts.

Tamil Nadu weatherman (@praddy06) posted on social media platform X that Kayalpattinam in Tiruchendur taluk recorded 932 mm rain in 24 hours—and this is the highest rainfall recorded in plains in Tamil Nadu in a day and that this amount of rain is the annual rainfall of that town. “Over the last 25 years, I have compiled this data,” he noted on X. “50 cm in 24 hours in plains is very, very rare without cyclonic storms,” he added.

West Coast Weatherman (@RainTracker) noted on X: “This is not a normal monsoon flood. This is not a normal flood. These are once in 200 years spell. Anyone living in groundfloor in these districts should move to higher ground immediately.” While noting that the rains in Kerala during these days are normal, he advised Sabarimala pilgrims to avoid visiting Aryankavu and Achenkoil and avoid using the Schengottai ghats roads as extreme rains are expected.

The problem that one administrator pointed out was that since they did not have adequate warning from the Met department, they had given people the option of shifting to a relief centre but did not compel anyone to do so. “We sent out text messages on December 17. The response was poor. By December 18 morning, we were not in a position to move them even if they wanted to be moved because that was the intensity of the overnight rain,” one official said.

Many elected representatives from the region reached their constituencies only late on December 18. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, Chief Secretary Shivdas Meena, and disaster mitigation teams had a series of meetings. The Chief Minister deputed four Ministers to monitor the rain-hit districts. On the state government’s request, the Government of India arranged helicopters to reach food to the marooned people in Tirunelveli. The National Disaster Relief teams too have been moved only on December 18 “in strength.”",flood,2023 Tamil Nadu floods,"Tamil Nadu, India",2023-12-15,2023-12-18,"['Kanyakumari', 'Tirunelveli', 'Thoothukudi', 'Thenkasi']","['932 mm in 24 hours at Kayalpattinam', '55.82 mm in 24 hours at Tirunelveli', '400 mm in 24 hours at Thoothukudi']","['Rs. 100 crore worth of crops damaged', 'Thousands of houses damaged', 'Roads and bridges damaged']","['10 people died', '100 people missing']","['Thousands of people evacuated', 'Schools and other educational institutions shut', 'Flight and train traffic disrupted']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Since our car was only mildly hit, I decided to take the DIY approach.

BHPian sathyasuri recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

Hello everyone,

I have a soon-to-be 8-year-old (in less than a week) Mahindra TUV300. Here is my narration of the ownership story (well, that was the original idea of this thread until the flood hit us) and its DIY work-in-progress (WIP) revival after it got mildly hit in the recent Chennai floods. I am posting this while the recovery is still in the WIP stage so that I can get guidance and some useful info on things that I encounter in the process from our experienced forum members.

Some background:

About the bond with the car:

To start with, we (the entire family) adore this car in spite of its many quirks and shortcomings. We call it the ""Yaanai Kutty"" (baby elephant in Tamil) mainly because it is black, chubby and quite brisk to drive.

I have a strange philosophy (maybe it is not just me), that got built up over years of driving, that life is like driving on the road. You see cars (people in real life) of different shapes (character of people) and sizes (capabilities of people). Some cars are smart, some are refined, some are flashy, some are calm and composed, some punch way above their weight, and some are underperforming, so you get the drift, right? In short, if cars were people in real life, then according to me TUV300 is like a reasonably good person who is mostly reliable, practical, forgiving and has a group of people who like him for what he/she is.

Let me get back to the topic, too much of overwhelming situations in a short span of a week make one philosophical.

From now on, I will try to keep it mostly pictures with minimal words...

The car on the day of arrival at our home - it is a 2015 Nov model. Being a T4+ variant, it came all black right from the factory in 2015 itself.

It had a few initial issues like the ones below:

Later it got retrofitted with the MLD as I was facing severe wheel spin issues while climbing onto my home parking on a daily basis.

Down the years some accessories were added, like a pair of fog lamps, Hella 700FF AUX lamps and recently an Android HU and it continues to be an all-black themed car.

It has taken us to different places and terrains reliably and without much difficulty.

Actually, MLD makes it very capable in bad terrains. It was able to negotiate this terrain without breaking a sweat. Sad that Mahindra didn't make a 4x4 variant.

The kids love it

One of its shortcomings is the lack of power, but it surely makes it up with its torque. So, it may not make it to places in good time but people (lots of them) travelling together in it end up having a great time

Wrath of nature

It has weathered some nature's furies including the previous 2015 Chennai flood, but back then it was still at the dealer's yard and was relatively safe as the area did not get flooded, but it did face the heavy downpour though. I followed our Tbhp PDI checklist and ensured the vehicle was safe to be picked up before registration.

During the Vardah Cyclone of 2016, these videos (clip 1 and clip 2)were taken after returning from an urgent Doctor visit during the storm.

I think Mahindra took this from me and never bothered to credit me.

Recent Chennai Floods

The day started like this:

The water level rose pretty fast:

Meanwhile, inside the home, the Ground floor evacuation protocol was activated.

The night was spent like this

Aftermath: the water level marks

Recovery DIY:

The garages, service centers and towing services were already crowding up, and our car being only mildly hit decided to take the DIY approach. Also, I was confident (I hope that it doesn't turn out to be overconfidence) about the level of damage and felt that I could do a careful job of putting it back into shape.

The DIY process:

Started the day by sharing the vehicle pics and discussing with Ignite Garage's Raghav (I have been servicing it there since the 6th year) and an ex-Mahindra engineer (cousin). As they had advised I checked the oil, and all appeared good, cranked it and it started on the first attempt without any white smoke.

It coughed up quite a bit of this gunk though.

I let the vehicle idle for about an hour or so. Then took it for a drive for about 10 km, varied the engine speed so that the water in the exhaust path was dried and left the vehicle in the sun with the doors open to allow sunshine.

The following day removed the seats.

First, discarded the Rexine cover, I never liked it from the beginning, but had it only for practical purposes as my kids were very young back in 2015.

Then removed the mats and the dampening material underneath.

Used cotton cloth and sponge to remove the flood water that had collected in small puddles, it had seeped in through the door beadings or through the floor openings (?), I need to ascertain that.

The floor being sun dried with a bit of assistance from the fans.

The condition is as above right now, I plan to dry the mats for another day or two.

Considering my needs, the utility it offers, the bond my kids have with the car (they swear that they will learn to drive only in this car) and the usage pattern (it has done only about 64K KM so far) I plan to keep the car for some more years. I service it at Ignite Garage and had all the fluids replaced about 4K KMs back in Jul 2023, the underbody was 3M coated in 2016.

So, Tbhpians, please suggest a way to treat the minor rust, observed on the front side floor, would a simple spray paint suffice, or is some extra care needed? Do comment if an oil change or other changes/points that I need to take care of. Also, I plan to sound-damp the car and upgrade the speakers, should I go for dampening the floor as well since it is anyway bare open now or just go for the door dampening alone and save some cash for the future?

Actually, the car as such is relatively calm compared to many diesel hatchbacks and monocoque SUVs, thanks to a good level of bonnet dampening and generous firewall shields from the factory itself.

I wish to hear from the forum members about their experiences with such DIYs. Most of the aspects about the car are already in the Tbhp TUV 300 review thread and yes, I would be happy to share my experiences on some specific queries about the car.

Thanks for your time!

Miffed by the anthropogenic contributions to flooding during Cyclone Michaung in Chennai earlier this month, the southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has called for a detailed report on encroachments around, and shrinkage of waterbodies, and action plans to protect wetlands and storage tanks in Chennai, Chengalpattu, Tiruvallur, and Kancheepuram.

The bench, comprising Justice Pushpa Sathyanaraya and expert member Satyagopal Korlapati, took suo motu cognisance of the flooding in Chennai and noted that damage to a large number of waterbodies, rivers and flood plains is widely believed to be a significant cause. “No doubt one of the reasons for the floods is extreme weather events but it cannot be denied that anthropogenic commissions and omissions have exacerbated the problem. In spite of the recurrence of the floods, the problem continues to evade a permanent solution,” it said.

Noting that citizens are also equally responsible for taking proper care of natural resources and the agencies responsible for the protection of waterbodies are found wanting, the bench ordered the Chief Secretary to the Tamil Nadu government to file an extensive report on a number of details: how many waterbodies were breached; district-wise encroachments in wetlands, storage tanks, rivers; the nature of the encroachments; plan of action to evict encroachments; extent of wetlands allotted to government departments for building offices or residences; storage capacity of tanks and the extent of shrinkage.

The report will also have to include regulations brought in to protect waterbodies, action taken to delienate buffer zones around wetlands, schemes launched since 2015 to increase the water storage capacity in Chennai, measures put in place by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority or the Directorate of Town and Country Planning to prevent flooding during monsoons, and technical solutions to impound more water in existing waterbodies.

To gain more insight into flood mitigation measures, a citizen forum has resolved to conduct fieldwork to prepare an audit on the effects the incessant rain and inundation have on the city and its surrounding areas at a meeting here on Saturday.

“After the unprecedented rain in 2015, they called it an event that occurred for the first time in 100 years. This time, they said it was a first in 47 years. An action plan has to be formulated to address flooding,” said V. Suresh, national general secretary, People’s Union For Civil Liberties (PUCL). He was speaking at the preliminary meeting of ‘Citizen Platform’, an initiative from 2016 which has been revived to address the effects of Cyclone Michaung. The meeting saw active participation of residents and residents’ welfare associations from several locations, such as Velachery, Virugambakkam, Perumbakkam, and Mylapore.

The platform resolved that an interim report would be audited in February and aimed to complete a detailed study in June. The framework for the comprehensive fieldwork will be decided by next week. The focus was on desilting waterbodies to improve their storage.

“The Virugambakkam Canal is always brimming and has been not desilted. Water from storm-water drains goes to such canals. If these are full the entire year, they cannot receive water during the monsoon,” said a resident of the area. Meanwhile, a resident of Perumbakkam pointed out that the size of the wetland had reduced significantly, blocking the outlets and causing waterlogging this year, which was worse than 2015.

Challenges for study

An audit formulated in 2016 by Arappor Iyakkam, a non-profit organisation, was presented by its co-founder Jayaram Venkatesan in the meeting, following which the group spoke on the possible challenges for the study to maintain its flow.

“Earlier, the initiative had fizzled out, but this time, all this planning is to ensure it doesn’t happen again,” Mr. Suresh said. Technological challenges apart, the participants also addressed the difficulties in coordination and also involving more people in the audit.

“The oil leak in the Ennore area will seriously impact the environment for the next two to three years. It will affect not just humans but also cattle and fish species. The government did not act swiftly; there is a lot of technology in the world to remove this oil spill, the government should have deployed them. Further, in these kinds of disasters, the government should have anticipated the oil spill, and a committee should have been constituted to address this. However, till now, no such thing has happened. They are saying that they have cleared the oil spill but we cannot accept that,” Ramadoss said.

On behalf of Pasumai Thayagam, an environmental organisation founded by PMK, a special medical camp was held at Ennore. Anbumani himself checked a couple of patients and offered them medical advice. Anbuamani said the residents have been complaining about having difficulty breathing, feeling skin burning, etc.

“These oil spillages and other disasters due to climate change will occur often in the upcoming period. In 2015, Chennai witnessed a massive flooding. After that, we produced a documentary, ‘Naam Virumbum Chennai’ (The Chennai we love), where we noted the floods could happen again in the next ten years, and it came within eight years. I am saying this now: the next few years are going to be challenging. Chennai might face another flood in the next five years, and the government should stay prepared for it,” he said.

The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) stated that its technical team submitted a report ascertaining that the cause of oil spillage into the Buckingham Canal reaching the Ennore Creek area happened from the Chennai Petroleum Corporation Limited (CPCL) refinery. Ramadoss noted that the government should form a special committee under a retired judge or let CBI take the case and conduct an enquiry to find out whether this was an oil leak or some chemical leak as this is a severe issue as they have seen in the past of factories discharging unpurified waste during floods.

The PMK leader noted that they could not accept the Rs 8.68 crore relief the government had announced for the families affected by the oil spill and demanded the government to provide a minimum of Rs 500 crore.

“The relief the government has provided now to the affected families in Ennore is a mockery. A great disaster had occurred, and the government is providing Rs 7,500 for affected families. In which period are we living? Each family should be provided at least Rs 10 lakh. The Chief Minister should visit this place, Ennore needs a special approach,” Ramadoss said.

“We cannot prevent super cyclones, super floods, but we can prevent the damages it can cause if we have proper planning,” he said, adding they would not hesitate to stage a protest if required over their demands.

After the state government held the CPCL responsible for the incident, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas issued a statement saying that due to unprecedented flooding in the city, the water level in the Buckingham Canal increased, causing reverse flow, and this appears to have carried some oil not just from CPCL refinery as well as from other industrial units in Manali into Buckingham when the flood levels receded.

The Chennai Cares volunteer says, “We tell them the rescuers have the skills, they know how to do it, and they have the equipment and stretchers for these situations. I tried to convince people to leave, but finally it is their call. People don’t realise that if they delay, it becomes even more difficult for them to be rescued.”

Better equipped 108 ambulances

There were a few silver linings. Sudha says that 108 ambulances were better equipped than in 2015. She points to two cases, where the 108 ambulance technicians came through when no one else could. “There was a 90-year-old woman who had had a fall and wasn’t conscious. There was no way of getting her out of the house because of waist-deep water. Her family tried paying people to shift her out, but nothing was working out. But the 108 ambulance people went and parked the vehicles 300 metres away. They waded through waist-deep water and brought her out in a stretcher,” she recalls.

In another case, a woman who had low oxygen levels was looking for an oxygen cylinder. “She didn’t want to be moved out as she lives with her elderly parents. When I called 108, they initially said they wouldn’t be able to deliver an oxygen cylinder. But eventually they were the only ones who got through to her. They met her and left the cylinder behind although it’s not the usual practice.”

Responsive and unreachable officers

Shyamala says that one key difference between the two floods was that there were more volunteer groups on the ground in 2015. She says, “People were cooking food in huge quantities and taking it to different places in 2015. It happened over a course of four or five days. I didn’t see it happen this time for more than two days. I guess the need for it was less compared to 2015.”

And although many parts of Chennai may have bounced back faster in 2023 than in 2015, this wasn’t true of north Chennai, says Sudha. “The relief centres in north Chennai were flooded or didn’t have food. I don’t think the government reached out to the residents in some areas. They still haven’t done the usual mobile medical camps or disinfected these areas.”

How responsive were monitoring officers when it came to reacting to many of the distress calls that Chennai Cares received? Sudha says that a couple of officers she was in touch with responded almost immediately. “Within just three rings, they would pick up their phones and say, ‘Okay, tell me what exactly is needed’. But in north Chennai, I struggled to even get through to them over calls, SMS, or WhatsApp. I got yelled at by many people who were upset that they hadn’t been rescued or that they had not received food. I also got yelled at by a monitoring officer. One of them said, ‘You’re sending us messages but they’ve already been rescued.’ I had to explain that I had sent those messages a couple of days ago. So it really depended on who the person was,” Sudha recalls.

While the relief operations concluded a few days ago, the focus for some members in Chennai Cares has shifted to the floods in south Tamil Nadu. And no, the volunteer group isn’t active only when there’s a flood. The reason the group changed its name from Chennai Rain Relief is because these volunteers have pitched in every time there’s been a disaster – from Cyclone Vardah to the COVID-19 pandemic.",flood,2023 Chennai Floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",16 November 2023,20 November 2023,"['Chennai', 'North Chennai', 'South Chennai']","['200 mm, 300 mm']","['$100 million', '$200 million']","['10, 20']","['Thousands of people displaced', 'Damage to infrastructure', 'Loss of livelihoods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The Advisory Committee for Mitigation and Management of Flood Risk in the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA), led by former Indian Administrative Services (IAS) official V. Thiruppugazh, has begun evaluating the area’s flood data from the last 30 years.

The members recently began inspecting areas across the CMA to determine the extent the local bodies had implemented flood mitigation measures recommended in an interim report the committee had submitted in May 2022.

The committee has so far inspected Venus Colony, Alwarpet, Trustpuram Canal, K.K. Nagar, Mugalivakkam, and Manapakkam and southern areas, such as Pallikaranai, Velachery, Narayanapuram, Nanmangalam, and Okkiam Maduvu.

The Scheduled Caste, Christian, and Muslim majority part of the city that is now called north Chennai was once the nucleus of Chennai, from where sprang the entire 1,189 sq km that is today called the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC).

The area that lies north of the Cooum River was once a small fishing hamlet (Kuppam) where about 20 fishermen families lived. Seeing the potential for a port at this junction of the river, the British East India Company decided to build a town in the area.

The land inhabited by the fishing community did not, however, belong to them on paper. The two chieftains from the Velama caste who lorded over the property – Damarla Venkatapathy Nayak and his younger brother Aiyappa – offered the land to the British. This land lay between the Cooum at the point where it enters the sea and the Egmore River, inside the existing Madrasapattinam port.

The British felt that this was a good spot to build a port because the land was at a perfect elevation and location to allow passage and docking of ships. Within one year of the land transfer in 1639, the British transformed it into the famous Fort St George. The area which had around 20 huts until then grew in size to have nearly 80 houses, with weavers, painters and others moving towards the business hub.

This settlement around the fort was named ‘Chennapatnam’ in honour of Venkatapathy Nayak’s father Chennappa Nayak. All traces of the fisherfolk who actually lived on the land have since been erased. This would later transform into Chennai, as we presently know it.

According to The History of the City of Madras written by CS Srinivasachari in 1939, several Europeans also moved inside the campus of Fort St George. The European settlement came to be known as ‘White Town’ and the area outside the fort campus that housed Indians was called ‘Black Town’ - deriving their names from the racist notions of the British, who considered Indians as ‘black’ and inferior.

‘Black Town’ was a bustling area of several businesses and was also densely populated due to its economic potential. Further, workers were taken from this region to parts outside India to work in plantations. During the French occupation in 1746-1759, this ‘Black Town’ was demolished and a new one was formed north of Esplanade Road.

In 1911, the name of the town was changed to ‘George Town’, and it served as the commercial hub of Madras City till the 20th century, after which it moved towards the south of the city which was at a higher elevation. It was at this point that the workers and labourers who built the city were left behind on the northern edge or pushed towards it.

A strange feature of Chennai is that for a seaside city, the sea is barely visible from most of the posh parts of the city. North Chennai is different in that the threat of rising waters and the awareness of the Bay of Bengal always looms large for its residents.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Speaking to journalists at Tiruchi airport, Mr. Annamalai said the four southern districts of Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, and Kanniyakumari had lost their productivity following heavy rainfall and flooding. It would take at least two years for these districts to regain their productivity.

Nearly 85% of the salt pans in Thoothukudi and paddy fields had all been devastated in the massive flooding, he said, and added that Tamil Nadu would lag behind in industrial output and productivity for six months every time the State witnesses heavy rainfall if it was not handled properly in the long term.

The Centre would definitely provide compensation to Tamil Nadu. But the DMK government was only spending time blaming the Union government and passing the buck.

Excess water from upstream Adyar will be channelled to Palar, thus reducing flooding in downstream areas.“We are still in a conceptual stage.The feasibility is being studied,” said a WRD official. “But there is a rider, Adyar is at 30m above mean sea level, while Palar is at 40m above mean sea level. So, Palar water would flow into Adyar river, given water flowing in the direction of gravity from upper gradient to lower gradient,” he said, adding they may have to pump water from Adyar to Palar via the canal. The canal could pass through Nandhivaram lake and Orathur reservoir when finished.Experts suggested that this solution is feasible if they find the right part of Adyar and Palar to link. “Not all stretches of Adyar are at a higher gradient. They have to study where the gradient is suitable for gravity to take excess water from Adyar to Palar,” said G Ravikumar, a civil engineering professor from Anna University’s Centre for Water Resources. “Otherwise, they can consider using the Outer Ring Road’s 25m-wide median area to carry floodwater from Chembarambakkam surplus.

Floods wash away Christmas joy in coastal Tuticorin

Punnaikayal, a coastal village in Tuticorin, is suffering the aftermath of the floods, with many families losing their homes and belongings just before Christmas. The predominantly Catholic community in Punnaikayal, known for their strong faith, is devastated by the loss of festive preparations. However, they find solace in the fact that their 400-year-old church remains undamaged. In nearby Serntha Poomangalam, another Catholic village, the residents also face homelessness and loss of livelihood. Despite the challenges, Tuticorin city continues its tradition of the OLS Carol carnival, where people of all religions come together to celebrate.

66 relief camps opened in Tuticorin dist

The state government has set up 27 camps in Tuticorin city and 39 camps in the district to assist people affected by floods. 7,500 people are staying in the city camps, while 26,000 people are staying in the rural camps. The government has distributed 55,000 food packets to the camp residents. To address the food scarcity, IAS officers K Senthilraj and Thakare Shubham Dnyandeorao have been appointed in Tuticorin and Tirunelveli districts respectively. The most affected areas include Srivaikuntam, Tuticorin, Kayalpatinam, Eral, and Alwarthirunagari. Army personnel and helicopters have been deployed for rescue operations, with 30 trips made so far. The Chennai corporation has also sent 100 pumps to drain stagnant water.

In Tuticorin 258 camps were conducted, followed by 178 camps in Tirunelveli. In Tenkasi where the impact of rain was not very bad, the department conducted only 32 camps, said the official.At the camps, veterinarians de-wormed cattle, goats, sheep, and poultry, vaccinated them, and provided mineral mixture to all the domesticated animals.

The disbursement of flood relief amount in cash has covered nearly 21 lakh beneficiaries in Chennai and parts of three neighbouring districts.

This accounts for about 85% of the total beneficiaries of 25 lakh. Going by the coverage, a total of ₹1,260 crore has been distributed to the beneficiaries, who have been identified mainly on the basis of ration cards.

Since Sunday (December 17), a sum of ₹6,000 each is being paid to flood-hit families in the four districts, subject to certain stipulations. In respect of those not covered under such conditions, the payment will be made through banks, based on the scrutiny of applications submitted by the affected persons. This will be done separately, says a government official, adding that “we have ensured the payment of relief only after bio-metric verification of the beneficiaries.”

Meanwhile, the Madras High Court’s suggestion of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) only through bank accounts has triggered a debate among policy makers on the hurdles being faced by the authorities in translating such an idea into a reality.

In support of the ongoing distribution of the flood relief amount in cash, the policy makers cite certain factors repeatedly. Paucity of time for verification of details of bank accounts, the possibility of multiple persons using the same bank accounts and the consequent effect of the needy not getting the amount, and the tendency of banks to adjust the relief amount against outstanding loans are among the reasons mentioned in defence of the move.

To a query, the official replies that under the given legal framework, the authorities can seek information from people regarding their bank details only in reference to any specific scheme and not otherwise.

However, there are advocates for DBT. K.R. Shanmugam, Director of the Madras School of Economics says that the DBT would be an ideal arrangement so that there is no room for any leakage. He hastens to add that the experience of Tamil Nadu is that the system of cash payment has been generally effective. Traditionally, the Pongal gift hamper included the payment of cash to the ration card holders.

The advocates point out that the idea of DBT is nothing new to Tamil Nadu and it has been practised for more than 10 years on many occasions or in respect of several schemes. At the time of Chennai floods in December, 2015, the relief amount ₹5,000 each was disbursed to 14 lakh families by direct transfer to their bank accounts at one shot. Next year, when the State was hit by a spell of drought, 32.3 lakh farmers were given input subsidy, totalling ₹2,247 crore, through their bank accounts.",discussion,2023 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 16, 2023","December 21, 2023",Chennai and parts of three neighbouring districts,100 mm,"₹1,260 crore",0,"21 lakh beneficiaries covered, 85% of the total beneficiaries of 25 lakh",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

About 20 centimetres of rain would cause severe inundation of houses and it was under the threat of sheet flooding of more than five feet of water, which would remain stagnant for around a week. The dream of making this locality flood-free seemed distant at the time but has now become a reality.

Every monsoon, Chitlapakkam would get inundated as the town is sandwiched between the flood plains of Selaiyur lake and Chitlapakkam lake surplus. As a volunteer of the Chitlapakkam Rising (CR) team and being a civil engineer and GIS consultant, I undertook a detailed study of various aspects — the flood surplus discharge into Selaiyur, Chitlapakkam and Sembakkam lakes; terrain study of Chitlapakkam flood plains, Contour study, and creation of merged revenue maps of Selaiyur, Chitlapakkam and Sembakkam villages to find the actual inlet channels and outlet surplus channels, their location, width, length and the interlink between upstream and downstream lakes.

This study gave us a clear idea of why the locality was flood-prone and how we could address the missing links of surplus channels between Selaiyur and Chitlapakkam lakes, and between Chitlapakkam and Sembakkam lakes. These channels were quite wide at the surplus weir and later became narrow terminating halfway, which led to severe flooding of homes in the area.

The beginning of a solution

The same was put forward by the CR team and 15 RWAs active in that area to the Water Resources Department (WRD) and Chitlapakkam town panchayat, and we also petitioned C Rajendran, former MP and Chitlapakkam resident. In September 2018, the then Chief Minister Edappadi K Palanisamy approved funding of around Rs.17.5 crores (Rs.12 crores from Public Works Department and Rs.5.5 crores from Chitlapakkam town panchayat) to construct an underground ‘macro cut and cover’ drain below the roads running along the residential areas of Chitlapakkam to mitigate flooding in that area. This would be the first of its kind in Chennai.

The first macro cut and cover drain for a length of around 1440 metres was constructed in the year 2019 by the local panchayat and WRD to address the flooding issue near Selaiyur Lake and this helped bring down the inundation level considerably. After this, the team decided to adopt the DDD (Deflect, Drain and Desilt-Deepen) principle to save Chitlapakkam lake. Under this approach, the idea was to deflect the sewage contaminating the lake, drain the sewage water and deepen the lake to allow it to hold flood water.

A landmark decision by CR team

In 2019, the CR team suggested to the WRD to consider deflecting sewage outfalls of Chitlapakkam lake by constructing peripheral sewage interceptors with pumping arrangements to the Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) throughout the year. Later, the polluted water could be drained from the lake and once it was completely dry, it would be helpful to desilt and deepen the water body. This measure would increase the rainwater holding capacity of Chitlapakkam lake, making it an excellent rainwater conserving structure and in turn, this would help in mitigating floods.

The WRD accepted this proposal and in 2020, work was carried out to deepen the lake. Because of this endeavour, the Chitlapakkam lake now has a water storage capacity of around 30 centimetres of rainfall from the catchment and is the only urban lake in the Tambaram locality, which stores only rainwater. This has set an example for effective flood management.

In 2020, another macro cut and cover drain for a length of around 650 metres, with a new flood regulator and sluice gates, was constructed to cut down the overflow of surplus water from the Chitlapakkam lake surplus weir, which used to inundate houses in South Chitlapakkam.

In the meantime, there was an immediate need to correct a missing link in the downstream areas of Thirumagal Nagar, Pradeep and Karthik Avenue and GD Naidu street, where the inundation was severe and prolonged for more than a week. We took up this issue with the Commissioner-Revenue Administration (CRA), who had called for a joint meeting with the Director, Town Panchayat, the disaster management team, and officials from the WRD and local Chitlapakkam panchayat, at Chepauk. Based on the intervention by the CRA, the Director, Town Panchayat released funds to the tune of Rs 3 crores and completed the cut and cover drain for these particular areas.

In 2022, we again noticed inundation issues from the Chitlapakkam lake bypass channel, which had affected around 20 streets nearby. Following our petition, the Commissioner of Tambaram City Municipal Corporation released funds for the construction of a 600-metre cut and cover drain along Pandiyan street via Ramanar street. This project was completed in November this year, helping in flood mitigation.

Meticulous flood management

The CR Team and RWAs in the area diligently record flooding observations, properly identify sources of floods and work out technical solutions that are put forward to the State government every year. Our efforts have borne fruit, as during the recent heavy rainfall caused by Cyclone Michaung, our area did not get flooded. On December 5th, the day after record rainfall caused havoc in Chennai, Chitlapakkam remained largely flood-free — even after 50 centimetres rainfall was recorded within 48 hours in our locality. What would have earlier taken a week to drain, this time within 12 hours of the downpour, the most flood-prone streets were free of inundation.

With its persistent efforts, the Chitlapakkam Rising team and more than 15 RWAs have shown how community participation in active governance can produce amazing results. Our goal is to work with the government to make our town 100% water-resilient and flood-free.

However, on Sunday, bulk waste generators were spotted dumping heaps of debris and construction waste along the Cooum river at Thirumangalam near Anna Nagar.Residents and activists point to the lack of boundary walls along the entire stretch of the Cooum and poor enforcement as the main reason for the indiscriminate dumping of waste and pollution of the river.They have demanded stringent action against those who pollute the river.Of the 29.5 km of the Cooum from the river mouth to Paruthipattu-Anicut, the water resources and revenue departments have only demarcated boundaries for 15km.Due to this, spots along Cooum from Koyambedu to Arumbakkam do not have boundary walls. This serves as an open invitation for people to dump waste.S Janakarajan, a water management expert, said people continue to think river banks are waste land. “There must be a behavioural change. They cannot keep dumping waste on riverside all through the year and expect the GCC to clear it. This must be considered a criminal activity and people must be taken to task legally,” he said.After the floods, more than 100 tonnes of waste, including plastic bottles, thermocol, slippers, bags, clothes and other items were collected by the corporation from the estuaries. The waste was washed away by the river to the sea during the floods and eventually was thrown back by the sea on the coast.GCC commissioner J Radhakrishnan said a total of 1.25 lakh tonnes of waste were cleared since December 4. “We have also finished removing garbage accumulated on beaches and the sea,” he said. This includes mats, clothes, thermocol, slippers, plastic bottles and plastic covers. “The waste is getting washed away because people dump them in the 47 canals that flow into the Cooum river,” he added.He urged people to hand over waste only to sanitary staff who come to collect waste and not throw them on the road or in bins.Civic activist Dhayanand Krishnan called for better monitoring and boundary demarcations along rivers.

Govt plans to drain out water to salvage Silkyara tunnel project

The government plans to drain out water from the area where the workers are stuck in the Silkyara tunnel project in Uttarkashi. Delay in pumping out the water can cause further damage to the excavation. One plan suggests sending a worker through a pipe to switch on the motor and drain the water. The project timeline will be extended due to the recent mishap.

Madurai: A week into the cataclysmic floods in Tuticorin , hundreds of sanitary workers drawn from various municipal administrations in the state are still working to pump out water from the northern and western parts of the city and clear slush all over. They include 24 teams which were at work during the Chennai floods. Mayor P Jegan told TOI that 80% of the city has been cleared of water as of now.He said that at the height of the floods, there was not much scope for pumping out the water, so the teams used to ‘ push ’ out the stagnant water through natural drains.The corporation hired high-pressure pumps from private agencies of Greater Chennai, Tirupur and Coimbatore corporations. “As many as 600 sanitary workers from these municipal administrations are still working to clear the slush in various parts of the city,” he said.The dewatering team from Chennai said the situation was very scary in Tuticorin for the first two days as they could not access many residential areas. “It was tough to drain the water because the drainage system was silted at many places and we didn’t know where to pump the water as the whole city was flooded,” an official of the dewatering agency said on condition of anonymity. From Wednesday, they opted for the push method using high power pumps.“On the first day, we could not map the drainage pattern of the residential areas due to a miscommunication with local officials. After clearly mapping the drainage system, we started pushing out the water,” added the official.Tuticorin residents say many residential areas including Muthammal colony, Kurunji Nagar, Aiyappan Nagar in north zone and Rajiv Nagar and surrounding areas in west zone still have about 1feet -2 feet of water. R Selva Kumar, a resident of Kurunji Nagar, said,“We are forced to walk in 2foot to 3foot-deep water right now as it was not pumped out fully.

One such event that left an indelible mark on the capital city of Tamil Nadu was the convergence of the devastating Cyclone Michaung and the resulting floods . The city, known for its resilience, faced unprecedented challenges as nature unleashed its fury.

Cyclone Michaung made landfall on the eastern coast on December 5, bringing with it torrential rains and powerful winds. The aftermath was felt across the region, with Chennai bearing the brunt. The cyclone resulted in widespread flooding, paralysing normal life in the city.

A Closer Look At Key Developments From Cyclone Michaung's Fury

Let's take a closer look at the key developments of Cyclone Michaung as it unfolded over the course of December.

Cyclone Michaung landed in Chennai and hit the eastern coast of India on December 5. With wind speeds reaching alarming levels, the cyclone unleashed heavy rains, setting the stage for the subsequent flooding. Initial reports highlighted the immediate impact on coastal areas, with residents urged to evacuate and seek shelter.

In the days following landfall, precisely December 7-10, Chennai experienced incessant rainfall, leading to widespread flooding. Roads turned into rivers, and low-lying areas faced the brunt of the rising waters. The intensity of the cyclone tested the city's drainage systems and exposed vulnerabilities in urban infrastructure.

As floodwaters inundated homes and displaced communities, a humanitarian crisis unfolded. The city witnessed a remarkable display of solidarity as volunteers, local authorities, and NGOs worked together to provide relief. Evacuation efforts were intensified, and temporary shelters were set up to accommodate those affected.

In the aftermath of the cyclone, attention shifted to assessing the extent of the damage. Thousands of homes were damaged and destroyed, and critical infrastructure faced severe challenges. The government, along with national and international agencies, initiated relief and rehabilitation measures to help affected communities rebuild their lives. Reconstruction efforts are ongoing, and discussions on climate resilience, urban planning, and disaster preparedness took centre stage.

As per the World Meteorological Organisation, Cyclone Michaung's name was suggested by Myanmar, and is pronounced ""Migjaum"". The word means strength and resilience.

In 2000, a panel of the World Meteorological Organisation together with members of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission prepared the list of names of tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, to be given from the September 2004 season. The name of each cyclone is picked from this list and cycles through each country’s suggestion.

For example, after Michaung (by Myanmar), the next five cyclones will be called ‘Remal’ (Oman), ‘Asna’ (Pakistan), ‘Dana’ (Qatar), ‘Fengal’ (Saudi Arabia), and ‘Shakhti’ (Sri Lanka).

As Cyclone Michaung approached north Tamil Nadu, Chennai and the surrounding districts of Kancheepuram, Thiruvallur, and Chengalpattu began to receive rain. A public holiday was declared in these areas on December 4 by the State government, however, it was extended till December 6, after the IMD forecast heavy showers.

By the evening of December 3, Cyclone Michaung was 200 km from the city, roughly east, and had slowed to around 8 km/hr. By December 4 morning, and contrary to expectations, it had moved more westward than northward, bringing it within 150 km of the city, dumping a large quantity of water as rain together with strong winds gusting up to 80 km/hr.

Chennai is locked in an inextricable battle with water. In the brutal summers, the city can’t get enough of it. And when it rains, the coastal metropolis of over four million people often finds itself inundated by too much of it.

The rains this year have been particularly deadly. Wide swathes of Chennai were underwater. For decades now, floods have ravaged the city, from the six-day-long downpour that submerged Chennai in 1943 to the more recent floods in 2005, 2010, 2013, 2015 and then this year.

Chennai's floods are mostly triggered by rapid urbanisation, destruction of critical wetlands, inadequate infrastructure. o much of it is also the consequence of Chennai’s geography, the city is spread across a low-lying area and is flat like a pancake. The average elevation of the city is only about 6.7 metres above mean sea level, with many neighbourhoods actually at sea level, which makes drainage a challenge even under normal circumstances.",flood,2023 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 5, 2023","December 10, 2023",Chennai and surrounding districts,"1,000 mm (39 in)",USD 10 billion,380,"Widespread flooding, displacement of people, damage to infrastructure","The floods were caused by the convergence of Cyclone Michaung and the northeast monsoon.

Many residents who had waited for the weekend to get application forms for flood relief at local fair price shops were disappointed as they were told that the deadline was over for the same.

Ganesh, a resident of Soolaima Nagar in Thoraipakkam, said that the shopkeeper at his fair price shop told him to go to the Zonal office of the Greater Chennai Corporation. “I was busy this whole week, so I waited for Saturday. When I went to the corporation office, they told me they had no role in distributing application forms,” he said.

A resident of Periyar Nagar, who had moved to Anna Nagar as their home got flooded, had visited their fair price shop and was told that the time for submitting application form was over. “We waited for the weekend to go to the shop. We were affected but won’t be getting any compensation,” said the senior citizen, who did not want to be named.

Consumer activist T. Sadagopan said that many people were waiting for the crowds to ebb but have lost the opportunity to submit application forms. “The entire process has been kept in the dark. People were asked only to collect forms from the shops, they could not give what was printed from social media. The public is being made to run from pillar to post for what is their right. The G.O. did not specify any last date for the forms,” he said.

Sources in the GCC said that the State government was yet to issue the rules regarding the verification process and the criteria for selection. “The scheme is being implemented by the Revenue and Disaster Management Department, and funds are released through the Co-operation, Food and Consumer Protection Department via the Public Distribution System (PDS) outlets.

Complainant Shanthi Kalaiarasan alleged that her husband had died of negligence on the part of the Madras Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology Hospital (MIOT). The hospital’s intensive care unit, located on the ground floor, was inundated in the savage rains that lashed the city in November-December 2015.

She said that the hospital did not take any precautionary steps despite a forecast of heavy rains and warnings by government agencies. The hospital’s oversight resulted in a power outage and consequently, vital life-support systems failed. Shanthi’s husband was among 18 patients who died.

“It is obvious that the failure of both the power, backup facilities, and the life support system, which were under the management and control of the hospital at the time of calamity, was due to the negligent ignorance of the hospital’s administration to diligently foresee the disaster despite prior information and thereby, they failed in averting the loss of human lives and protecting the infrastructure,” the court said in its judgement.

“A case of administrative negligence is thus clearly made out and there is no difficulty for this Commission to fix the liability upon the hospital,” it added.

Besides mandating the hospital to pay ₹20 lakh as compensation to the complainant, MIOT was also asked to bear an extra cost of ₹2 lakh.

The case

Shanthi’s husband suffered a head injury in 2015 and was diagnosed with acute haemorrhagic stroke and brainstem haemorrhage at another hospital. He was later shifted to MIOT to avail insurance coverage.

At MIOT, he was diagnosed with hypertensive brainstem bleeding with status epilepticus and was admitted to the ICU. He was unconscious and after undergoing tracheostomy and intubation, his breathing was stabilised with ventilator support.

Due to restrictions on visitors and heavy rains and flooding in the city, the complainant was unable to visit the hospital for three consecutive days from 1 December.

She claimed that the hospital authorities did not inform her about the flood situation. She came to know of her husband’s death through the media on 4 December 2015.

Shanthi contested the death certificate, alleging a deliberate misrepresentation that cited the diagnosed ailments at the time of admission as the cause of death.

She asserted that her husband, along with other patients in the ICU, died due to a lack of ventilator support. Despite flooding in November, the hospital did not advise the patients to move to other facilities.

The complainant argued that the hospital ignored warnings by the state government. It started evacuating patients only on the evening of 3 December. Emphasising these factors, she alleged clear negligence and carelessness on the part of the hospital authorities and asserted that it was a suitable case for applying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur (the thing speaks for itself).

The hospital’s version

Countering the allegation, the hospital claimed that the patient — identified as an alcoholic — suffered from various severe health issues, including hypertension, diabetes, and lung complications.

Regarding the flood incident, the hospital said that the situation was beyond its control due to the overflowing of the Adyar river. The floodwater affected a chocolate factory and subsequently breached the hospital’s wall, resulting in substantial losses.

MIOT further contended that the heavy rains led to a city-wide power failure in Chennai and Kancheepuram districts, over which they had no control. They emphasised taking necessary steps to rescue and assist patients by relocating them to other hospitals in the city.

Additionally, the hospital cited a decision by the Madras High Court related to a public interest litigation filed in 2015. The high court Bench had dismissed all allegations against the hospital regarding deaths during the floods, instructing the police authorities to submit a final report after a thorough investigation.

Denying any negligence on its part, the hospital argued that the complainant’s husband succumbed to his illnesses, including refractory status epilepticus, brainstem haemorrhage, septic shock, acute kidney injury on acute peritoneal dialysis, type-II diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.

It asserted that the patient received top-notch medical care and treatment, and the cause of death listed on the hospital’s death certificate was corroborated by the postmortem certificate issued by a government hospital.

The commission’s verdict

The Consumer Commission noted that in instances of administrative negligence, the onus of providing proof to demonstrate that it undertook all essential and reasonable precautions to avert potential harm from an anticipated calamity or danger rested on the hospital.

Addressing the specific circumstances of the case, wherein the complainant contended that the hospital neglected to implement requisite preventive measures in anticipation of rains and floods, the Commission observed that “merely because the power outage and the consequent life support failure was caused due to heavy flooding, the hospital authorities cannot seek to be absolved without showing something further to indicate that preventive and proactive measures were taken well in advance and that despite their anticipatory measures, the mishap had become inevitable.”

The Commission also found that despite the ability to foresee and diligently prepare for any emergency that was well fathomable from the weather forecasts frequently updated, the administration of the hospital deliberately failed to take any real anticipatory measure to protect the power units and the critically-ill patients on the lower floors.

The consumer court noted that the hospital could have shifted the patient to another hospital or elevated floors of the international block of MIOT which had all facilities. The failure amounted to a breach of duty to ensure continuous availability of life support to the patient. It also pointed out that the manual ventilator did not function properly.

The Commission expressed the view that the hospital’s deficiency in life support facilities played a role as a contributing factor in the demise of a majority of critically-ill patients. Drawing attention to the high court Bench’s ruling, the consumer court clarified that the order specifically addressed the matter of “unauthorised construction” and did not encompass the broader issue of “negligence”.

While the Commission found the hospital accountable for administrative negligence, it acknowledged that despite the considerable extent of the negligence, it was not willful.

It mandated the hospital to pay the compensation within six weeks.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Life in Chennai was paralysed on Monday due to incessant heavy rain spells in the last 24 hours caused by cyclone Michaung in the Bay of Bengal. Five deaths were reported due to electrocution and tree falls. On the same day in 2015, December 4, the city witnessed a similar unprecedented spell that was never seen for decades, leaving the city crippled.

Most offices and manufacturers, including Foxconn and Pegatron, makers of Apple iPhones, were closed due to the heavy rain, say wire reports.

On Monday, life was thrown out of gear due to the heavy spell, with all modes of transport affected badly. Citizens took to social media to post videos of extreme flooding in various parts of the city.

As the water level at Bridge No 167 near Sullurpeta station reached the danger mark, railway services from Chennai Central were stopped in the morning. In several parts of the city, there was no power since Sunday night.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah spoke to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin and Puducherrry CM N Rangaswamy and took stock of the measures taken to tackle the challenging weather conditions caused by the cyclone.

He assured all necessary assistance from the Centre to secure lives. Adequate deployment of the NDRF has already been made and additional teams are ready for further assistance.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that the severe cyclonic storm Michuang was at 100 km east-northeast of Chennai. It continued to move northwards at 10 kmph speed.

The Chennai district received close to 400 mm of average rainfall in two days — between the 24-hour period ending at 8.30 am on December 4 and the 24-hour period ending at 8.30 am on December 5 — according to TNSDMA. In the district, ward 169 in Perungudi registered the highest average rainfall of 293.4mm, followed by CD Hospital (ward 43) in Tondiarpet (233.6 mm) and ward 111 in Nungambakkam (223 mm). Of the 43 stations in the city, 17 recorded over 200 mm of average rainfall in the two days. In 22 stations <200 mm but >150 mm was recorded and only four stations received less than 150 mm rainfall.

If stations around the Chennai district were also considered, Avadi (278.2 mm) and Poonamalle (241.3 mm) followed Perungudi. These figures show that all parts of the city and its surroundings were battered.

Map 1 | The map shows the average rainfall received over two days in the 51 stations in and around Chennai in the two days mentioned above.

This year, the rainfall pattern was different. In 2020, Cyclone Nivar-hit Chennai escaped widespread flooding despite receiving copious rainfall as it was distributed over three days with many gaps in spells. In 2021, many parts were inundated despite relatively less rainfall, as rain came down in short and intense spells. In 2023, the city neither received heavy downpours in a short time like 2021, nor did it have many gaps like in 2020. Instead, it recorded numerous bursts of rain over a longer period, with only brief intervals in between as explained in Chart 2 and Table 3.

Chart 2 | The charts show rainfall recorded in Nungambakkam in three periods — every 15 minutes from 9.15 pm on November 23, 2020, to 11.30 am on November 26 2020, and every 15 minutes from 12 am on November 5, 2021, to 2.45 pm on November 7, 2021 and every 15 minutes from 12.15 pm on December 2, 2023 to 3.15 pm am on December 5, 2023 — all amounting to about 64 hours each.

2020: In the 64 hours in November 2020, 320.5mm of rainfall was recorded. None of the 15-minute spells crossed the 20mm mark.

2021: In the 64 hours in November 2021, 252.6 mm of rainfall was recorded. Three 15-minute spells crossed the 20mm mark.

2023: In the 64 hours in December 2023, 501.5 mm of rainfall was recorded. None of the 15-minute spells crossed even the 15mm mark.

Table 3 | The table summarises the three charts. For instance, in the 246 15-minute spells considered each year, only 107 spells recorded no rainfall (0 mm) in 2023, whereas 2021 saw 178 such spells and 2020 saw 140 spells. This shows in 2023, breaks between spells were rare.

In 2023, though there were no >15mm spell, there were many more spells in the 3-4mm, 4-5mm, 5-6mm, 6-7mm, 7-8mm, 9-10mm and 10-11mm ranges than 2020 and 2021. This shows that consistent rainfall of medium intensity with very few breaks caused the floods this year. Also the total rainfall of over 500 mm was way higher than 2020 and 2021.

In 2015, the sudden and excess flow of water from Chembarambakkam reservoir was cited as the reason behind floods claiming hundreds of lives in Chennai. In 2023, the management was much better, leading to the controlled outflow of water and preservation of lives as shown in Chart 4.

Chart 4 | The charts compare the inflow (red bars) and outflow (blue bars) of water to and from the Chembarambakkam reservoir in 2015 and 2023. Both inflow and outflow are measured in cubic foot per second or cusec and plotted on the left axis of the graphs. The actual storage in the Chembarambakkam reservoir as a share of its full capacity in % is plotted on the right axis.

In 2023, after a 90mm rainfall on November 30, the outflows were increased in the subsequent days in a controlled manner and the storage was reduced from 89% to 76%. When two spells of heavy rains — 162mm on 24 hours ending December 4 and 204.8 mm on 24 hours ending December 5 — fell on the catchment areas, there was no need to increase outflows too much as a counter. In contrast, in 2015, the storage levels were maintained at the same level after initial rainfall of over 100mm on November 24, leading to uncontrolled outflows on December 2 after heavy rainfall.

This was my feeble message while informing the editor that I would not be able to post the column last week. I was stuck in Chennai amidst the floods. While the world outside was watching video clips and news, for those of us stuck inside our homes, only the immediate environment and needs seemed relevant. There are many stories to tell, but I will stick to some pointers with relevance to personal finance.We are meant to collaborate and live as a community. Nothing demolishes the notions of class, privilege, disparity and preference like a crisis. Even as some hesitated to ask or interact, everyone was drawn in to help one another, especially when it became clear that no one else was around to offer help and support. Food, water, milk and supplies were shared. The elderly were offered special care. We don’t train or prepare for collaboration as we grow up. We typically spend a good part of our lives competing and excelling as individuals, and our wealth is so privately ours. However, one crisis is enough to show that sharing matters so much, to us and others.The problem of plenty hit everyone. In the good old days, our homes had a bag of sand and a large stone handy during the monsoon. During incessant rains and the first sign of flooding, the only loo at home would be covered. Cleaning after the floods was easy. This time, it was terrible dealing with sewer waters everywhere on the roads and homes. Putting things up earlier was easy. There was one attic in which everything precious went. Now, there are multiple fridges that can’t be lifted; air conditioners that can’t be removed; electronic goods all over the house and cars that won’t move in water. It was tragic to see millions worth of white goods go to waste in one single episode of flooding.Insurance lessons are learnt and lost very quickly. Many view insurance as a payment that offers no benefit. No one around where I lived seemed to have comprehensive insurance for their cars, homes and durables. Who can tell what can happen when? How to know if the payment is worth it? Why pay when we cannot get any benefits? These questions belie a basic understanding of insurance. Many did not believe that the insurance companies have the expertise to price the premium based on probabilities and are obliged to pay when genuine claims arise. Many admitted to buying insurance after the 2015 floods and discontinuing the premium later as wasteful.Getting phones charged was the priority for everyone. To connect, to contact, to help and to execute. Many felt relieved that their financial information was stored electronically. Those who used the digilocker facility were even happier. There was an 86-year-old gentleman on the fourth floor, who told me that he felt grateful for the digitalisation of the financial markets, having lost a whole bag of newly acquired blue-chip share certificates to the floods in the 1970s. He also remained calm and collected, his minimalistic lifestyle needing nothing on an everyday basis. I manage my finances in a way that I am prepared to go anytime, he told me. Those words are my lesson from this calamity.Regret and missed opportunities to do better ruled many conversations. When the lifts were dysfunctional, many chose to remain indoors and complain about their lot. A few of us who were fit enough did multiple rounds of going up and down the stairs. Why wouldsomeone not take their fitness seriously? Isn’t it burdensome if one cannot lift oneself from one place to another in a crisis? How will they rush down if there is a fire? Why is the expectation, that someone else will be around to help, so prevalent? I did not ask these questions as it would be rude, but I could not help thinking about things we can do routinely to stay in shape, physically and financially, so we are not lost in a crisis.Everyone had someone to blame. The government did not plan or execute the storm water drains correctly. The construction approvals were corrupt and buildings have come up on water bodies, and so on. The truth is that tens of thousands of Chennaiites have bought homes on these very plots. Their single biggest asset is their house. Or houses, if you will. I risk being killed if I point out that property investments are a bad idea, at this time. The circle of concern can widen to capture the world and its limitations. However, the circle of control still remains in the realm of what we do with our incomes, how much we save, and where we invest those savings. Every crisis is an opportunity to test one’s asset allocation.Inequalities hurt the most. Even as rains began, strongmen appeared magically to quickly whisk away the well connected and the privileged to safety, much before the floods hit. They went about their tasks mechanically. Neither them, nor the rescued bothered about others in their community. We accept privilege without question. In temples, at airports, on roads, and in crisis. We are so feudalistic at heart while claiming to be a democracy. While the middle class ponders over the questions we raise here, the poor are left to begin from scratch all over again. They lose whatever they have, go without incomes and, therefore, food, for days on end, lose their homes and the little things they have collected, have no savings to lean on, and if they haven’t fallen ill from the poor sanitary conditions, will return to work and start over. The soul of the nation lies in how it treats its less privileged.Every time there is a crisis, we hear the words resilience and strength. We hear how a city bounces back despite everything. That is not a badge of pride. It is an inevitable reaction for survival. It is tragic that people must be ready to go through their lives without a break, even if a crisis has torn them apart. People need help for a long time after the floods have receded. Many may not even ask. Do look around and participate in any way you can to help them deal with the aftermath of this severe damage.The Author IS CHAIRPERSON, CENTRE FOR INVESTMENT EDUCATION AND LEARNING",flood,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",11 November 2015,5 December 2015,Chennai city and suburbs,"1,044 mm (41.1 in)","Rs. 10,000 crore (US$1.4 billion)",500,1.8 million people displaced,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage, and encroachment of water bodies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,severe

Reply by Tarun Mathur, Chief Business Officer, General Insurance, Policybazaar.com

Natural disasters are increasingly wreaking havoc across various regions of the country. Events like cyclones, earthquakes, and floods, once sporadic over several years, are now occurring with greater frequency within shorter periods. As a result, home insurance has shifted from being optional to becoming imperative, especially for people living in India. As you mentioned, you live in Chennai, given the unpredictable nature of floods in the region, buying comprehensive home insurance is prudent to protect both the structure as well as the contents that make up your abode.

In India, home insurance commonly covers both structure and contents, offering comprehensive protection. This insurance is available to homeowners and can be extended to rented homes. A robust home insurance policy acts as a shield, safeguarding your home against potential risks, including structural damage from natural calamities or unforeseen disasters. Moreover, it includes coverage for belongings and in-house possessions like jewellery, furniture, electronics, gadgets, and household appliances such as TVs, refrigerators and more.

Home contents insurance extends its coverage to various scenarios, encompassing risks like fire incidents, equipment malfunctions, and accidental damages as well. It offers protection for nearly all valuable items and personal belongings within the home. Nowadays, certain insurance plans may include coverage for fine art pieces and provide protection for specific high-value items, with the insurer agreeing to pay the agreed-upon value. Depending on policy terms or choosing some add-ons by paying a little extra, it also safeguards portable assets such as mobile phones, computers, bicycles, and more.

Besides this, the policyholder must understand that the potential cost of refurbishing your entire home after a catastrophic event like a floodfar surpasses the premium paid during the policy period. When deciding on the coverage amount for both building and contents, always remember to consider factors like house type, location, and the value of possessions. The premium calculation involves various parameters such as house age, structure type, construction costs, etc. Here’s the breakdown:

Also read: Are salaried employees taking home loans before they hit 30?

Also read: Check these practical tips to get the highest bid while selling your old car

The sum insured for the property structure is = built-up area X Cost of construction per square foot (as on the date of policy purchase)

For instance, if your property area is 100 square feet and the insurer's construction rate is Rs 500 per square foot, the sum insured for the property structure would be Rs 15 lakh.

The sum insured for house contents is = The assets' actual cash value (ACV) or the current market value minus the depreciation based on usage.

Your home isn't just a shelter; it's an emotional treasure. So, perceive home insurance as an investment in safeguarding your most valuable asset rather than considering it a mere expense.

Take your time to research online options, focusing on details like premiums, claim settlement ratios, and policy inclusions and exclusions. Do not forget to delve into the fine print! Carefully consider every aspect that makes your home special, ensuring protection without any unforeseen surprises.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Friday said the Central team’s endorsement of the manner in which the administration handled Cyclone Michaung and the Chennai floods, proved the government’s “efficient performance”.

In an interview with The Hindu, Mr. Stalin said the government would soon make public the report of the Thiruppugazh Committee on the long-term flood mitigation plans for Chennai and its surroundings. The government would also state the actions taken on the report and the status of the projects. “We are running an honest and transparent administration. We will also release a report on measures taken to control flood in Chennai and its neighbouring areas and the expenditure involved,” he said.

Asked if the government could have tackled the recent floods better, he said, “I always would like to do more for the people.”

Updating the status of the flood mitigation projects, he said the integrated stormwater drain (ISWD) project was completed for a length of 44.88 km along the Adyar and Cooum basin with ₹120 crore funding from the World Bank. Besides 50 km stormwater drain projects were implemented at a cost of ₹255 crore under Singara Chennai 2.0. In addition, 59.5 km project at a cost of ₹232 crore under State disaster management fund and 11 km project from the capital fund had been completed. The ₹700 crore projects reduced the damage in areas such as T. Nagar, Ashok Nagar, Ambattar, Valasaravakkam, Alandur and Pulianthope that suffered heavily during the 2015 flood.

“It is very vital to protect the entire marshland in Pallikaranai as it plays a pivotal role in mitigating the flood damage. We will certainly reevaluate the usage of areas around Pallikaranai marshland. The forest department has taken measures to protect and expand the marshland,” he added.

The Chief Minister said the administration was preparing the Third Master Plan incorporating schemes to mitigate damage in Pallikaranai marshland and areas around it. “This will certainly pave way for the improvement of waterbodies and marshlands around Chennai,” he said.

Mr. Stalin rejected the charge that the government was sluggish in removing encroachments. “It is the stand of the government that all encroachments should be removed. Waterbodies and river basins should be protected from illegal encroachments. They should be cleaned and expanded,” he said.

“We identified 350 encroachments and recovered 475.85 hectares in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Chengalpattu districts between 2021 and 2023. Similarly, 19,876 encroachments in waterbodies under the management of the Water Resources Department and 220.45 hectares have been recovered,” he said.

Mr. Stalin charged that the opposition, which issues statements confronting the government, never bothered to go to the field during the recent disaster. “They also did not involve themselves in relief works,” he charged.

An ISWD project in the basin of Kosasthalaiyar is being implemented using ₹3,440 crore from the Asian Development Bank. “We have completed 68% of the work. It will benefit people in Tiruvottiyur, Manali, Madhavaram and Manali,” he said.

A similar project is being implemented in the Kovalam basin with financial assistance of ₹1,714 crore from the KFW bank. It would benefit people from Nanganallur, Kannan Colony, Mayilai Balaji Nagar, Bhuvaneswari Nagar, Puzhuthiwalkam, Kannagi Nagar, MCN Nagar and Thoraipakkam. When the rest of the work is completed, it would benefit people of Indira Nagar, Neelankarai, Vettuvankeni, Chemmancheri and other areas of South Chennai.

Planned discharge of surplus water from the city reservoirs based on the Regional Meteorological Department’s accurate cyclone forecasts helped avert flash floods in the major rivers during the historic rain caused by cyclone Michaung.

The Water Resources Department started to gradually reduce water release from the city reservoirs, including Chembarambakkam, Poondi and Red Hills, on Wednesday. The water discharge that was as high as 8,000 cubic feet per second from Chembarambakkam reservoir on December 4 was reduced to 2,500 cusecs as rainfall has stopped over the region.

Water Resources Minister Durai Murugan inspected the reservoir on Wednesday along with various government officials. The Chembarambakkam reservoir’s storage is now being maintained at 3,459 million cubic feet (mcft) against 3,645 mcft.

Officials of the WRD said the department had shifted from its conservative approach in reservoir management this monsoon. The department had been experimenting on pre-emptying a marginal amount of storage ahead of the peak monsoon for the past two years now.

This year, it may be recalled that a minimum quantity of storage was depleted from the reservoirs be it Chembarambakkam or Red Hills ahead of the unprecedented rains. A gap of at least three feet was maintained at each reservoir feeding drinking water to the city to create more storage space.

“For instance, we had let out additional water from Chembarambakkam more than the inflow received during the initial rain spell. During peak inflow, we were able to reduce discharge and store more water in Chembarambakkam with additional storage space. Adyar river carried only peak flow from upstream stretches like Adhanur during 10 hours on the day of torrential downpour. Flash floods in Adyar river inundating neighbouring areas were averted with these balancing measures of managing discharge from Chembarambakkam,” said an official.

Such steps helped in allowing fluvial floods from various parts of the city to drain into the river. Adyar river now carried a flow of about 23,000 cusecs and can carry up to a maximum of 45,000 cusecs without spillover.

Similar measures were carried out in Poondi reservoir across Kosasthalaiyar river as well. Unlike 2015, the reservoirs continue to be filled to their brim now due to the flood routing measures. The storage in the reservoirs was brought down to 75% during the days of downpour and now again built to nearly 94% on Wednesday, officials said.",solution,Chennai Floods 2023,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 4, 2023","December 6, 2023","['Chennai', 'Tamil Nadu']","['120 cm in Chennai', '200 cm in some parts of Tamil Nadu']","['100,000 homes damaged', '$1 billion in damages']",['20 people killed'],"['Transportation disrupted', 'Power outages', 'Water contamination']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Drains to drones were readied in Chennai as authorities had plenty of time to prepare for the rains with a delayed and weak start to the north east monsoon. After the DMK formed the government in May 2021, an additional 876.19 km of storm water drains have been constructed in Chennai. Drones have been deployed to cover 5,820 sq km of Chennai’s basin to identify the flow of water, inundation, lack of connectivity between drains in physically inaccessible areas for corrective measures.

The city corporation has deployed 16000 workers, 491 motors, and additionally 150 tractor borne motors across the city. Except for one, all subways were open to traffic on Thursday, the civic body said.

Saving Chennai from flooding is a matter of serious politics for chief minister MK Stalin who was in the civic headquarters at the Ripon buildings on Thursday monitoring mitigation work. Stalin instructed officials and elected representatives to visit their localities to take up relief work. The chief minister also responded to emergency calls received at the control centre in the civic headquarters.

T Nagar –which is usually severely affected– received 12 cm of rainfall, said Chennai Mayor R Priya. “Corporation employees worked all night to drain out the water,” the Mayor said. “We are attending to all the complaints from the public zone wise and rectifying the issues. There is no major complaint of rainwater mixing with sewage water.”

Chennai’s corporation commission J Radhakrishnan also said that only selected localities were inundated.”Except for selected areas, the water is draining completely in the majority of the places,” he said. “The chief minister has been monitoring the situation. We have put 15 IAS officers across the city. Water is receding rapidly. We faced challenges in some parts in Korattur, Ambattur and Anna Nagar, but it has been rectified.”

Weather department have forecast heavy rainfall for Chennai and other districts up to December 5. The Indian Meteorological has issued an orange alert for Tamil Nadu and neighbouring Puducherry which is likely to receive rainfall ranging between 115 up to 204 mm between December 2 and 3.

Chennai Corporation has undertaken several measures as part of its preparedness for the heavy rains. More tractor-driven pumps, heavy duty motors and additional workers from other parts of the State have reached the city to assist the civic body in the monsoon relief work.

Heavy duty diesel-operated pumps have been deployed at 37 locations. Eight heavy duty diesel-operated pumps are ready for deployment. A total of 650 pumps have been deployed for dewatering localities in the city in addition to 184 tractor-driven pumps. Twenty more such pumps will be deployed shortly.

Chennai Corporation Commissioner J.Radhakrishnan inspected the surplus course of lakes such as Puzhal in Manali zone. “In areas that faced inundation, officers have been posted as in-charge at several locations,” he said.

“We have standard operating procedures for handling disasters and normally during every Northeast monsoon, two to three systems do develop. We are working very closely with the Indian Meteorological Department and would focus on early warning, especially for low-lying areas and areas known to be prone to inundation. We have mobilised additional motors. All monitoring officers have been pressed into service to be of help to the assigned zones. We are focussing on coordination with Water Resources Department, CMWSSB, Tangedco, Metrorail, Highways and other departments,” Dr.Radhakrishnan said.

Ambattur ward 84 Councillor J.John said his ward has received two 100HP motors for the first time to bail out water from flooded areas such as Korattur. “We have also stationed four tractors in our ward. Canals that carry water to the Korattur lake and the surplus course are not designed properly. So areas such as Korattur get flooded. Thanks to the 100HP motors, we cleared stagnation from Korattur on Friday. Over 500 houses were affected by flooding in Korattur Housing Board. We are hoping to utilise more resources for improving flood preparedness,” he said.

Stressing the need for clearing uprooted trees, Dr.Radhakrishnan said 190 power saws, six tree pruning machines, 61 telescopic pruners, and four robotic multi-purpose excavators have been deployed. “Also, we are keeping medical facilities on alert. We have made arrangements to activate the 162 multi-hazard shelters and keep ready the cooking centres. We have asked the staff to pay special attention to areas where water-logging or stagnation was reported in the recent past. We have also planned for organising medical camps,” he said.

Eight years ago, a mere six-month-old Chennai Metro Rail system that connected only a 10-km stretch from Koyambedu to Alandur came to the rescue of the people of Chennai during heavy rain. Today, it has once again turned out to be a lifeline and a reliable mode of transport for several people who were stranded in different parts of the city owing to flooding and had to necessarily commute.

Trains started operating from 5 a.m. and continued to run till the end of the day without any disruptions. On December 5 too, Chennai Metro Rail will function as usual from 5 a.m. till 11 p.m.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), the majority of passengers who took trains on Monday were either heading back or to one of the transport hubs like railway station or airport. “Since we have a station at all transport hubs, thousands of people found it convenient to use the service, since most of the roads are inundated. Majority of the travellers carried baggage and we saw a lot of footfalls to and from Chennai airport, CMBT, Chennai Egmore and Chennai Central,” he added.

St. Thomas Mount metro rail station couldn’t be used largely due to heavy flooding of the parking area. At Koyambedu, CMRL asked commuters to board via the foot overbridge due to waterlogging in the approach roads. Most of the other stations remained accessible to commuters.

Residents park vehicles in CMRL stations

With many streets getting flooded, a section of residents parked their cars and two-wheelers at the parking lots of the Chennai Metro Rail stations. Most of these parking lots are located at an elevation from the road, thereby preventing water from entering the exhaust of the vehicles. A few Metro Rail commuters, who came in their personal vehicles to park and board the train, were asked by staff to park the cars elsewhere as the parking lots were full.",solution,2023 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 4, 2023","December 6, 2023","['Chennai', 'Tamil Nadu']","['200 mm, 300 mm']","['$100 million', '$200 million']","['10, 20']","['Thousands of people stranded', 'Flooding of roads and railways', 'Damage to property']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Lieutenant Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Saturday, December 9, 2023, expressed dismay over the handling of the floods in Chennai, following Cyclone Michaung.

Interacting with reporters after visiting the Regional Level Science Exhibition in Puducherry, she said people in Chennai were complaining about poor relief work. “It is very disturbing to see the suffering of the people. Several areas are still inundated and people are not getting assistance. Residents are not getting essential items, including milk. Legislators should visit the affected areas and provide relief on a war-footing,” she said.

The Tamil Nadu government should have taken steps to prevent flooding before the onset of the monsoon, Ms Soundararajan said, urging authorities to take steps without delay for the prevention of an outbreak of communicable diseases following water-logging in residential areas.

“After I make these comments, people may turn against me asking me to concentrate on Telangana and Puducherry. But I have every right to express my anxiety as I belong to Tamil Nadu. Those in the government should not get offended by criticism; instead they should take corrective measures,” the Lt Governor said.

Among those being evacuated from flooded low-lying areas in Chennai were actors Aamir Khan, Vishnu Vishal and badminton player and Arjuna Awardee Jwala Gutta. Rescuers used boats to reach people stranded in their submerged homes.

An estimated 13 people have died in the flooding that was triggered by the torrential rains that preceded Cyclone Michaung, which made landfall in Andhra Pradesh state on Tuesday afternoon.

Rescuers used inflatable rafts and ropes to pluck people out of their homes in Chennai, a city of more than 6 million people and a major automobile and technology manufacturing hub.

Videos of rescue workers wading through waist-deep water and submerged vehicles have been doing rounds on social media. Air Force helicopters also dropped food rations to people stranded in flooded homes.

""There are pockets of low-lying areas,"" said Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner Dr J Radhakrishnan. ""We hope to clear it soon.""

This week's floods in Chennai brought back memories of the extensive damage caused by floods eight years ago which killed around 290 people.

Some residents questioned the ability of the city's infrastructure to handle extreme weather. Chief Minister MK Stalin wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking Rs 5,000 crore for the damage.

Raj Bhagat P, a civil engineer and geo-analytics expert said better stormwater drainage systems in the city would not have been able to prevent the flooding.

""This solution would have helped a lot in moderate and heavy rainfall, but not in very heavy and extremely heavy rains,"" he said.

What is Urban Flooding?

The flooding of land or property in a built environment, especially in densely populated cities where rainfall exceeds drainage systems' capacity, is known as urban flooding. It is a manmade disaster.

Urban flooding, in contrast to rural floods, which are caused by heavy rain over a flat or low-lying area, is caused not only by higher precipitation but also by unplanned urbanization.

Urban flooding in India

India's urban population is anticipated to reach 814 million by 2050. As a result, it is important for the government to focus on city master plans and urban renewal initiatives as essential components in order to reduce urban flooding.

BCCL/Representational Image

Urban floods are now a national problem in India, affecting mega and metropolitan areas almost every year. Ahmedabad was inundated by heavy rainfall in July 2022. The ground floors of many housing societies and bungalows were submerged.

Due to heavy rainfall in November 2021, several areas were submerged in Chennai which also led to blackouts and a few Chennai territories were marooned. Hyderabad faced unprecedented precipitation levels in October 2020, resulting in the deaths of nearly 50 people and the destruction of property worth over Rs 5000 crores. At various times, cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Patna, and Pune, were also flooded, bringing them to a halt for several days.

What causes it in India?

The original built-up area of Indian cities has expanded dramatically over the past two decades. New developments are taking place in low-lying areas of Indian cities and towns due to rising land prices and less availability of land in the city centre. Most of the time, these developments take place on encroachments over lakes, wetlands, and riverbeds.

In order to accommodate the higher flows of stormwater, it would have been ideal to widen the natural drains but large-scale encroachments have occurred without widening the natural drains. Thus, flooding occurs as the capacity of the natural drains is decreased.

BCCL/Representational Image

Climate change is leading to extreme weather and causing an increase in the frequency of short-duration heavy rainfall resulting in higher water run-off. Apart from that, floods in urban areas are also caused by the sudden and unplanned release of water from dams and lakes without giving the public enough time to respond.

According to NASA studies, the urban heat island effect also causes more rain to fall on urban areas and cause flooding. The hot air pushes the rain-bearing clouds higher as they pass over the urban heat island, resulting in highly localized and occasionally intense rainfall.

How does it impact?

Floods in urban areas frequently result in deaths and injuries, either directly or indirectly by causing water-borne diseases to spread during the event.

AFP/Representational Image

It causes structural damage to buildings, property, crops, etc. and also disrupts infrastructure like the water supply, sewerage, power lines, transmission lines, communication, and traffic on roads and railways.

Health problems including epidemics and plagues are invited by stagnant stormwater, contaminated drinking water and solid waste and sewage.

What can be done?

The most effective strategy for minimizing property and life loss is to construct them away from floodplains and other flood-prone areas. Also, rainwater harvesting should be included in all infrastructure constructions to ensure better water management. Along the sides of roads, bioswales should be constructed so that rainwater can percolate into the ground and flow toward them.

BCCL/Representational Image

The development of blue-green infrastructure will help in the situation. The term ""Blue-Green Infrastructure"" refers to a network that uses infrastructure, ecological restoration, and urban design to connect people with nature to solve urban and climate problems. Blue denotes tanks and water bodies, while green denotes parks, gardens, and trees.

For better development planning, geospatial technology should be used for flood vulnerability mapping. Further, natural water bodies should be strictly desilted and maintained to ensure the free flow of excess water.

Click here

V S Jayaraman, who lives on an apartment on the first floor in T Nagar, is moving 17km away to higher ground in Chrompet, where he has another flat. “I’m also ready for the rains. I’m moving,” says the pensioner who has been the troubleshooter for local residents for decades. “Every year, we have to be scared of the monsoon.”

Jayaraman’s building is inundated every year with rainwater entering homes of those on the ground floor. Since the apartment building is old, all the electricity network is on the ground floor, so they stay without power and water for days until the rainwater recedes.

“I was worried about how I will shift my 97-year-old mother, but she passed away in August,” said Jayaraman. He had even readied a private van to shift his mother to Chrompet. Now he is packing just one bag with essentials. “I have a flat there. It’s empty now for me to move during this type of emergency. After Diwali, I will move and stay there until the monsoon is over.”

Because of his work, 40 years ago Jayaraman began living in T Nagar in the heart of Chennai, a bustling residential and commercial hub, which is swarming with Diwali shopping, but is an example of improper city planning when the rains arrives. Interestingly, T Nagar is chosen for a transformation under the Union government’s Smart City project.

Two years ago, S Ravichandran, also a resident of T Nagar, got stone slabs constructed in his front and back entrances to prevent water from coming in. In 2021, he moved to a nearby hotel during the northeast monsoon, where he and his wife stayed for a week until they could come back home.

In 2022, he is looking to sell his house. The first question buyers ask him is if water stagnates. “And I tell them the truth. Immediately, the value comes down by at least 10 lakh. I’m praying that water shouldn’t enter my house this year. Otherwise, I have to go to a hotel again and it will be increasingly hard for me to dispose of this house,” Ravichandran said.

He recalled that during the 2015 devastating floods in Chennai, water was knee deep inside his home on the ground floor of an apartment building which was bought in 1982. “I have sentimental value attached to this home, which is why I have stayed here, but what can I do if a natural calamity affects my house,” he said. “I have to move.”

A Hemalatha, who has been living in one of the worst affected localities, the low lying area of Velachery in south Chennai, will be moving with her parents, grandmother and a younger brother 20km away to stay with their relatives in Royapuram for the next two months. It’s here that boats are often deployed during the monsoon.

Her apartment is near the Velachery Lake and its reduced storage due to urban development contributes to the flooding. “It’s an ordeal every year. Rainwater comes in because we live on the ground floor, so we don’t keep very expensive things in our house and we go to our relatives house during the rainy season,” said Hemalatha. “We stay in touch with our neighbours and we return only after the water is completely drained.”

Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu such as Krishnagiri, Trichy, Salem, and Hosur districts, have been receiving rains on and off, especially during nights and mornings. S Balachandran, head of the Regional Meteorological Centre in Chennai said that the northeast monsoon is delayed. “At present, the southwest monsoon is still continuing,” Balachandran said. “The northeast monsoon will be delayed. There is a system which has formed locally which will bring rains now.”

Last year, incessant rains in November made it one of the wettest for Chennai, which had registered a rainfall of 882.4mm up to November 28, leaving several residents marooned. In the past decade from 2011, November 2021 witnessed the second highest rainfall recorded for the month. In November 2015, Chennai received a record rainfall of 1049 mm, according to the weather bureau. The all-time record for November is from 1918, when Chennai received 1088.4 mm of rain.

On Thursday, R Priya, mayor of Chennai, Gangandeep Singh Bedi, commissioner of Greater Chennai Corporation, Cheapaul MLA and DMK’s youth wing president Udhaynidhi Stalin and civic officials held a meeting on the ongoing stormwater drain network.

K N Nehru, minister for municipal administration, urban and water supply on Thursday told reporters in Namakkal district that there is an effort to create a reservoir like the one in Chembarambakkam to store rainwater. “Everyday, we are working towards meeting the effects of northeast monsoon,” Nehru said.

Chennai has been a mess due to ongoing work on widening the stormwater drain network. Authorities are building new links and reconstructing old ones such as in T Nagar, where the drain has been expanded from two feet to four.

In a bid to prevent floods in residential areas near waterbodies in Greater Chennai Corporation limits during the northeast monsoon, the Water Resources department has started releasing water from eight lakes in Korattur, Madhavaram, Kolathur, Porur, Ambattur, Ayapakkam, Paruthipattu and Thirunindravur.

Water will be released at frequent intervals while maintaining the level as per a prescribed Standard Operating Procedure. Instructions have been issued to the assistant engineers in this regard. However, the executive engineers have been empowered to decide the water level to be maintained as per the forecast for the northeast monsoon.

Of the four non-ayacut tanks with shutters, the water level stood at 14.3 metres in Porur lake on Monday. By November 30, the water level may touch 14.6 metres, 14.9 metres by December 15 and 15.5 metres by December 31.

Similarly, the water level in Kolathur lake will range from 7.4 metres to 8.6 metres during the same period. Madhavaram lake will maintain the water level ranging from 6.2 metres to 7.4 metres. The water-level at Korattur lake will be kept from 10 metres to 11.2 metres during the northeast monsoon.

Four lakes in Ambattur, Ayapakkam, Paruthipattu and Thirunindravur do not have shutters. The engineers concerned have been asked to maintain the water level from 15.7 metres to 16.9 metres in Ambattur tank. In Ayapakkam tank, the water level will be maintained in the range of 16.8 metres to 18 metres. On Monday, the water level in Paruthipattu tank was maintained at 22 metres. In Thirunindravur, the water level will be maintained between 31 metres and 32.6 metres.

Several areas in Chennai saw waterlogging and squally winds uprooting trees in Chennai and in the nearby Chengalpattu district. The rainfall triggered by the Cyclone has caused severe Waterlogging in low-lying areas. Roads in the MMDA Colony in Chennai's Arumbakkam were seen waterlogged. A video showed a large tree uprooted in Egmore, causing several damage to a petrol bunk nearby.

Cyclonic Mandous had made landfall off Mamallapuram on Friday evening influencing moderate to heavy rainfall in coastal Tamil Nadu.

Mandous is all set to weaken to a deep depression and later a depression on Saturday.

S Balachandran, DDGM, RMC Chennai, said ""Cyclone Mandous crossed the coast and is in deep depression and its strength is weakening. It is moving towards the Northwest direction so areas in northwest districts will witness strong winds of 55-65 kmph which will further decrease by evening to 30-40 kmph.""

Earlier today, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) requested people to avoid going out until Cyclone Mandous weakens. It is said that almost 65 trees fell in three hours and motor pumps are being used to remove water stagnation in low-lying areas.

Notably, National Disaster Response Force personnel are on standby. The Tamil Nadu government put out a list of helpline numbers in case of any flood-related emergencies.

The Greater Chennai Traffic Police Saturday in a tweet announced that vehicular movement along the East Coast Road (ECR) resumed at 6 am. The stretch had been closed since 10 pm last night, due to the cyclone.

Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin on Friday said that all the precautionary measures have been taken. ""The government has taken all the precautionary measures and the officers are regularly monitoring the situation,"" said Stalin.

Stalin visited and inspected the state emergency operation centre, Chepauk amid the cyclone's severity. He said that the monitoring of the cyclone has also been deployed district-wise.

""Whatever the situation may be Government will ensure the protection of the people. District wise the monitoring of the cyclone has also been deployed,"" said Stalin.

Stalin urged the people to follow the orders of the government and corporate with the government. Meanwhile, Dindigul Collector has declared a holiday for schools and colleges in Sirumalai and Kodaikanal for Saturday.

During the monsoon, commuters using public transport face severe hardships in the form of flooded and slushy bus termini, roof of buses leaking, and poor sanitation.

A major portion of several bus termini in the city numbering around 35 have become prone to flooding because of the height of the road having been increased gradually over the years.

The Broadway bus terminus which is the transport hub linking the city to the suburbs for the thousands of routes is a prime example of the poor maintenance of a bus terminus.

T. Dinesh Kumar, a trader from Tambaram, said the footpath is the only place where the public could take shelter during rain but has been completely occupied by the shops and restaurants.

Similarly the commuters complained about the flooding problem persisting in the bus termini in the core parts of the city of Mandaveli, Perambur, Ayanavaram, Anna Nagar West, Korattur, and Mogappair east and west. These bus termini despite having storm water drain network facility face flooding owing to the increasing height of these roads.

Consumer activist T. Sadagopan said the bus termini located on the western suburbs covering Ambattur Industrial Estate, Ambattur OT, and Avadi, were covered with roof, but still commuters faced hardship because of stagnation of rainwater.

The situation in south Chennai also doesn’t look positive as the bus termini at Thiruvanmiyur, Iyyapanthangal, Vadapalani, Medavakkam, Kannagi Nagar and Hasthinapuram, suffer from water stagnation even for mild showers, complained commuters.

The commuters also want the MTC to take steps to monetise the bus termini and cited the failure of the T. Nagar bus terminus to be re-developed under the Smart City Mission. The sprawling bus terminus-cum-depot was proposed to be developed into a modern facility but it never took off.

A senior official of the MTC said a few bus termini including the Mogappair East and West were being renovated.

Passengers using the Dr MGR Chennai Central railway station were shocked to find the roof in platforms 2 and 3 leaking when heavy rain lashed on Monday night. The video of the leaky roof at the central station also was circulated on the social media.

As the first spell of the northeast monsoon is expected anytime in the city, the Greater Chennai Corporation has taken steps to deal with the threat of floods.

Special teams have been deployed for emergency response. A team of over 2,000 workers has started checking all electrical installations, including 2.3 lakh streetlights and 7,000 pillar boxes, to prevent electrocution during the rain. “Rainfall is expected for three days in Chennai. Control rooms have been set up in all the 15 zones,” an official said.

City residents can call Corporation helpline 1913 for reporting civic issues during the monsoon. Flood control room landline numbers for the Corporation in Ripon Buildings are 044-25619206, 044-25619207 and 044-25619208.

After an IT professional, who tried to cross the median in Pallikaranai, was electrocuted last week, civic agencies have started checking the safety of electrical fittings ahead of the monsoon.

Trees pruned

Teams have been deployed to prune trees following complaints from residents. “We started pruning of trees in August. It is an ongoing process. Parks Department is supervising it,” said an official. As many as 21,271 trees have been pruned in the 15 zones of the city. Most of the trees have been pruned in Anna Nagar.

“We are inspecting all the lampposts and tightening the cables. Additionally, pumps have been prepositioned in highly vulnerable spots along with arrangements for operators and diesel generator sets,” said an official.

Mayor Priya Rajan conducted coordination meeting with line departments ahead of the onset of the monsoon this week in the presence of Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi. Fuel companies have been instructed to keep sufficient stocks. Communication companies have been instructed to keep generators near mobile towers and telephone exchanges.Hospitals have been instructed to keep generators on the first floor or above to avoid accidents.

Officials of the Civil Supplies department have been instructed to keep sufficient stocks of grain and pulses in case of any need for mass cooking. Relief shelters have been made ready in all the 15 zones.

The Corporation centralised kitchens have been refurbished and are in a state of readiness.

Staff strength

To respond quickly to complaints from residents, the civic body will increase the number of lines for helpline 1913 from 10 to 50 on Monday. Complaints received on 1913 lines, social media complaints, Namma Chennai App and website — all complaints will be entered into the integrated PGRS (Public Grievance Redress System) from where these are forwarded to the field official and updated by the control room.

The Chennai Corporation has created a separate module for disaster management in the Integrated Command and Control Centre. It carries rain data from 30 rain gauges, rain forecast data from TNSDMA (Tamil Nadu State Disaster Management Authority) real-time flood forecasting system, real-time flood levels in major canals, bridges and subways at 41 locations, besides active monitoring of all subways through cameras.

The civic body has developed a disaster management app for officials, which contains contacts of field officials across departments of the State government, availability of critical machinery with departments, relief shelters, private marriages halls and colleges in case required for coordinating for shelter and snake catchers. The app provides reports to officers regularly regarding inundation, deployment of motor pumps, tree fall, and food distribution.

Canal not widened

S. Kumararaja, vice-president, Annai Indira Nagar Residents Welfare Association, said the dumping of waste in Pallikaranai marshland over the past few decades has led to accumulation of huge amount of silt in the marsh, affecting monsoon preparedness in the area. “Highways department has not completed widening of a stretch of 110 metre of the 2.5-km canal that carries surplus water from Velachery lake to Pallikaranai marshland. It widened 220 metre from 6 metre to 8 metre.

The end point remains a bottleneck, which is likely to cause flooding in Vijayanagar 13th Main road and Ram Nagar. The shutter has not been widened,” said Mr. Kumararaja.

“Construction debris and silt in another 4-km canal along Taramani Link Road have reportedly not been removed by the Public Works Department. Residents have requested officials to clear the drain,” said Mr. Kumararaja.",solution,Chennai Floods 2022,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","October 31, 2022","November 2, 2022",['Chennai city'],"['100 mm, 150 mm, 200 mm']","['$100 million', '100,000 homes damaged', '100 deaths']",,"['Transportation disrupted', 'Power outages', 'Water contamination']","['The floods were caused by heavy rainfall from the northeast monsoon.', 'The floods caused widespread damage to infrastructure and homes.', 'The floods also led to power outages and water contamination.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Minister for Water Resources Duraimurugan inaugurated the work on flood mitigation at an estimated cost of ₹165 crore in the southern parts of the city on Monday in the presence of Health Minister Ma. Subramanian.

According to a press release, restoration and sprucing up of Madurapakkam and Ottiyambakkam canals was one of the important component of the scheme in Tambaram and Vandalur taluks of Chengalpattu district. The water from various neighborhoods and excess water from lakes are carried by these canals to the sea via Pallikaranai marshland. During the 2015 floods, the canals carried 3,000 cusecs of water to the sea in Muttukadu, passing through Pallikaranai marshland, Okkiyam Maduvu and Buckingham canal.

The topography in Perumbakkam and Chemmenchery facilitates flow of excess water from the 35 lakes in Vandalur towards the Pallikaranai marshland. However, after a large number of houses came up in the area, this natural flow of water has been disrupted. For instance, near the DLF Garden City apartments, the drainage system has been disturbed. There water stagnation of up to 5 feet in the area during the previous monsoon. Similarly, with the Tamil Nadu Urban Habitat Development Board constructing tenements in Perumbakkam and Chemmenchery, there was been disruption in the flow of rainwater towards Pallikaranai marshland.

The excess water from Madurapakkam canal does not have a defined route in some areas and has been the major cause of flooding near DLF Garden City. Similarly, the water from Ottiyambakkam canal does not have a defined route after Survey No. 254 and has caused flooding in the Arasankalani and Perumbakkam areas.

Chief Minister M.K.Stalin inspected the flood-hit areas on November 29 and December 1, 2021 and ordered officials to mitigate flooding. Following Mr. Stalin’s visit, a detailed project report was prepared and six schemes for flood mitigation have been launched in the area at an estimated cost of ₹165.35 crore, the release said.",solution,2021 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu","November 29, 2021","December 1, 2021","['DLF Garden City', 'Arasankalani', 'Perumbakkam', 'Chemmenchery']","['100 mm', '150 mm', '200 mm']","['Damage to houses and property', 'Disruption of traffic', 'Loss of livelihood']",0,"['Thousands of people were displaced from their homes', ""The floods caused major disruption to the city's infrastructure"", 'The floods had a significant economic impact on the city']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The need for collective action was felt acutely during this time as residents were marooned in more ways than one. The AGS Colony Residents’ Welfare Association (ACRWA) in Velachery West was started as a response to the crisis that ensured during the floods and the difficult aftermath that many residents had to deal with.

Some home truths from the floods

The 2015 floods were a difficult time for all Chennaiites, especially those in AGS Colony, as flood waters did not recede even after three to four days. Most ground-floor houses were submerged and people lost their belongings.

During this time, the residents understood the need for our input in flood mitigation and monsoon management. We floated the residents’ welfare association with the key goal of improving the neighbourhood.

The following Northeast Monsoons in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 saw the situation remain almost the same with little improvement in flood mitigation. Our previous representations had yielded only minor tangible results because of reasons we could not fathom. This was when the members decided to pursue a different approach by establishing a working relationship with all officials assigned to our area on a regular basis. This was a must to achieve our basic demands for the overall development of the area.

RWAs as a knowledge centre

The RWA members had a battery of suggestions on flood mitigation based on their experience in recent years. We decided to take them up one by one with the officials whom we had built a rapport with over time.

We took upon our first demand of flood-free neighbourhoods with the installation of a permanent pump house for flood mitigation. Based on our suggestion, a pump house was set up at the disposal point of Veerangal Odai where storm/rain waters from more than 35 colonies empty into the Pallikaranai marsh.

Until the imposition of lockdowns due to COVID-19, a major part of the work of the RWA was to would travel to Ripon Building, the headquarters of the Greater Chennai Corporation at least once or twice a week to engage the officials. The members also frequented the Zonal Office in Adyar on a weekly basis with our suggestions and inputs. The RWA also created a technical team comprising retired civil engineers who guide us with the suggestions which we put forth to the civic body.

The construction of the permanent pump house was completed in November 2020 during the pandemic period and started its operation on December 4, 2020.

Our Velachery-based RWA has worked relentlessly on achieving the main goal of a flood-free area, in order to save residents from a nightmare every time it rains.

RWA involvement in stormwater drain creation

During the monsoon in 2021, the flooding returned. This was when the importance of an effective stormwater drain network was underscored. The RWA requested our ward officials to conduct an inspection along with office-bearers and our technical team to identify issues with the SWD network.

After an inspection that lasted more than three hours, we sent a final proposal to the civic body identifying the missing links, spots for interlinking of SWDs, locations where it is necessary to construct new drains and a request for the demolition and reconstruction of brick drains to Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC).

The proposal was accepted by the civic body and work started in May 2022. The entire process was completed in a record time of five months. The consistent follow-up we had with GCC and the motivation to make our colony flood-free helped these efforts.

Efforts come to fruition

After the onset of the Northeast Monsoon this year, the magnitude of rain in Velachery and other parts of the city has been such that the entire area would have faced severe inundation if not for the action taken in the past few months. Linking of drains, RCC reconstruction, and construction of new drains to ease outflow to the nearest disposal instead of detour all played a huge part in keeping parts of Velachery flood-free, as hoped for by the RWA.

The RWA monitored the work closely along with the officials and the contractors on a daily basis to sort out minor issues that cropped up during the time of construction effectively. Our residents cooperated very well in sync with our activities and supported us in achieving our goals.

There were a few areas that saw water stagnation and some SWDs took more time to dispose of water as the inflow was heavy. These small shortcomings were noted down and the civic body has been apprised of these issues to be corrected before the next spell of rain.

There is still a long way to go before this monsoon ends. But the members of the RWA and residents in the area are confident that the coordination between residents and government agencies will hold us in good stead even if rains were to intensify.

RWAs taking up a variety of issues

Since its inception, the RWA has accomplished various goals by engaging closely with officials of multiple government agencies. There is now a 100 per cent potable water supply to all streets in our area after a continuous follow-up with the Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) which changed old damaged lines, arranged for new distribution lines, and linked other streets which were deprived of water pipelines.

The OSR gifted to GCC by AGS Cooperative Society has been developed into a beautiful Republic Day Park in 2018.

The next goals have been to create a direct link road to Velachery 100 Feet Bypass Road and to MRTS IRR.

There is no public hospital or a community hall in our neighbourhood and we are coordinating with the Department of Health, Government of Tamil Nadu for the construction of the same in a vacant land belonging to GoTN.

Pointers for other RWAs on engaging with government agencies First, we should know the hierarchy of any organisation that the RWA wishes to engage with. In the case of GCC, Assistant Engineers should be the first person of contact for any needs, as they are the ones who are in charge of the particular ward and are always on call in their respective areas. If ineffective, the matter can then be escalated to Assistant Executive Engineer, Executive Engineer, Zonal officer and Regional Deputy Commissioner (North Zone, Central Zone and South Zone). If there are any issues or clarifications needed by RDC for taking up the petition, residents can take an appointment with Commissioner for suitable action/solution. Once any project is commissioned, RWAs need to monitor their progress on a daily basis and discuss the pros and cons with the AE and other field officials. RWAs should never instruct the contractors by themselves. If any issue needs attention, RWAs can contact the respective AE or AEE and suggest possible fixes which will then be communicated to the contractors entrusted with doing the job.

The Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has started adopting localised solutions for resolving issues of waterlogging during the northeast monsoon.

After the onset of the monsoon, there were a number of places where the civic engineers have been advised to go for localised solutions, Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said.

“For example, after residents and motorists complained about waterlogging in Tamil Salai at Egmore in front of Mathsya Hotel during the previous spell of rain, engineers installed Hume Pipes to cross the water from the other side to the major drain,” he said. It was set up overnight by the team consisting of Regional Deputy Commissioner, North, Sivaguru Prabhakaran and a zonal officer. This stopped the water flow over there, he added.

Similarly, in Pallavan Salai, Kolathur, there is an old brick drain structure which had actually collapsed and its flow was obstructed. As an immediate solution, the Corporation, instead of constructing a new drain, has put up a precast drain structure in the last two days, which will be completed by tomorrow and that should ease out the water flow in that location, said an official.

In zone 4, Tondiarpet, in a number of drains which were entering Buckingham Canal, shutters along with the pumping of water have been introduced to prevent the water from flowing back into the local habitations, and at the same time, pumping will ensure the rainwater is drainer quickly, officials said.

In the case of flooding in Aziz Nagar and Subramaniapuram, the engineers changed the entire watershed from the Adyar to the Cooum in a bid to offer localised solutions. “Water from Aziz Nagar and Subramaniapuram was diverted to Trustpuram Canal, which ultimately goes to the Cooum. Otherwise, the water originally used to go to Mambalam Canal and then to the Adyar. This has given relief to the T. Nagar areas and critical habitations,” an official said.

Residents in Kolathur had demanded that the Corporation implement work to mitigate waterlogging in areas such as G.K.M. Colony. In Kolathur, steps to even out the intensity of water flow gave a big relief to 70 Feet Road, which usually gets flooded.

Even in Ripon Buildings area, the water was diverted to the Buckingham Canal through the local railway station area, and the GCC also put up additional pumps and constructed sumps to mitigate flooding in the event of heavy rainfall.

Another example of the localised solution which has been successful this monsoon is opposite the Police Commissioner Office on Poonamallee High Road. “In a bid to divert the water to Cooum, the Corporation, Highways and Railways coordinated to install huge precast drains and a huge sump inside St. Andrews Church premises and pumped water directly to the Cooum through pipes. That gave relief to the area around the Egmore railway station, officials said.

Engineers of the Corporation, led by the three IAS officers with engineering backgrounds, who have been posted as Regional Deputy Commissioners, have used localised solutions to sort out issues then and there.

“We also are further examining more localised solutions for other waterlogging problems wherever they are reported. Currently, the focus is primarily on preventing waterlogging on major roads to prevent any disruption of traffic flow in the city during the rain. Work on cleaning silt catch pits along more than 1,400 arterial roads is expected to resume this week and will be completed by this week,” an official said.

In the flood-prone Seethammal colony, the water was flowing through Ranga Road. The water was diverted through spread out waterways, which were used after IIT-Madras vet their design. Now, the area has no waterlogging.

The news of a cyclone hovering over the Andaman and Nicobar islands pushed the panic buttons of the otherwise pragmatic Chennai residents and the social media pages of weather bloggers were full of queries on flooding. The distress of the residents was justified, as Chennai is only 6.7 metres above sea level and more often than not, large areas of the city are quickly flooded after a shower. Memories of the misery of the Chennai floods in December 2015, resurfaced.

These incessant rains since the first week of November increased the water table in many areas. In low lying areas, to be precise (areas which were once waterbodies or floodplains), groundwater has been seeping into basements and the ground floor of houses.

As Chennai went through another major flooding, the importance of the Pallikarnai marsh came to the fore once again. The marsh, the last remaining natural freshwater wetland in Chennai, acts as a sponge, storing the heavy monsoon rains and releasing them during dry months. There have been recent efforts to protect what is remaining of the marsh and raise awareness levels among the public.

Shrunken natural sponge

The Pallikaranai marsh, known as kazhuveli (waterlogged area) in Tamil, is a wetland and falls within the Perungudi and Pallikaranai villages of the Kancheepuram district and lies parallel to the Buckingham Canal in Chennai.

The Old Mahabalipuram Road, also known as the IT Corridor or Rajiv Gandhi Salai was inaugurated in 2008, and cuts across the marsh as does Chennai’s Mass Rapid Transport System railway line and stations. The presence of a large number of Indian and multinational companies on the Old Mahabalipuram Road has led to the development of residential and commercial spaces in the areas adjacent to the road.

Jayshree Vencatesan of Care Earth Trust told Mongabay-India that the importance of the Pallikaranai wetland has been forcibly brought to the notice of the residents of Chennai during the two major floods (in 2015 and now in 2021) that inundated this seaside metro.

According to research done by the Care Earth Trust in 1991, the marsh covered 2,450 hectares in 1991 but by 2015 the marsh had lost out to the various developments including the railway line and covered just 600 hectares.

Despite its reduced area, the marsh acts as a sponge that stores the heavy monsoon rains and releases them during the dry months, said Vencatesan.

The shrinking Pallikaranai marsh boundaries and the infrastructure projects overlapping with the wetland.

Vencatesan said that in 2007 Chennai suffered very heavy rains, which flooded parts of the city. The then Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa did an aerial survey of the marsh and immediately understood the benefits of protecting and preserving the wetland. The floods also revealed that the dumping of toxic waste along with the discharge of untreated sewage had caused major damage to the flora and fauna in the marsh.

The first step towards changing the land use of the marsh was taken on April 9, 2007, when the government of Tamil Nadu notified a major portion of the Pallikaranai marsh as a reserve forest area and brought it under the Tambaram range of the forest department and named the Pallikaranai Swamp Forest Block.

The initial survey by the government demarcated 317 hectares of the marshland as a reserve forest. Earlier, this land was classified under the revenue records. With this demarcation, stringent action could be taken against encroachers and polluters under the Tamil Nadu Forest Act and Wildlife Protection Act.

The Pallikaranai marsh has been a sink for the city’s sewage and also has two garbage dump yards. On March 25, 2008, the High Court of Madras said, “It would be wise and economically sensible to use the marshland as a natural flood-control option rather than tamper with natural drainage, and then re-invest in flood control or damage mitigation at a later stage.”

However, despite the pleas of the civic groups and environmentalists the encroachments and dumping in the marshlands continued. In 2015, when major floods hit Chennai, the toxicity and pollutants in the wetlands came as an ugly wake up call for the city’s residents and the administration.

Ramsar Convention recognition

Supriya Sahu, Principal Secretary, Forests and Environment, Tamil Nadu Government, told Mongabay-India that the aim of the administration is sustainable development and that the government is fully committed to protecting what is left of the marsh.

Recently, the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin inaugurated a walkway and viewing gallery at the Pallikaranai marsh which environmentalists say is a step in the right direction as it will raise awareness levels among the public.

Sahu said that the government was working towards the Pallikaranai marsh being declared as a Ramsar site following a Madras High Court directive. The government has also taken steps to declare the marsh as a bird sanctuary, as a large number of migratory birds visit the area.

On September 24, Justice N Kirubhakaran of the Madras High Court had ordered the Tamil Nadu Forest and Environment Department to prevent non-forestry activities in the marshland. The court also passed an order to move the two dump yards located in the marsh to other parts of the city and directed the government to reclaim unutilised land allotted to government industries and institutions.

The forest department has begun this process, according to Sahu. The government has also started fencing the marsh on all sides and removing blocks in the water channels. According to the High Court order, a compliance report has to be submitted by December 21.

Vencatesan who has been studying the wetland since 2001, said that there was a change in the government’s stance after the 2007 floods and the marsh was declared a priority wetland. The Government has been cancelling various allotments for real estate and industrial developments since that time and reclaiming land for the wetland. Today the acreage stands at 700 hectares.

Stormwater drains

Among the recommendations implemented after the 2015 floods was a new stormwater drain project, which too fell short in protecting the city against the floods caused by heavy torrential rains on November 7 and November 11.

Under the project – which was developed after the 2015 floods when Chennai Corporation engineers found that the drain network in many areas was either defunct or missing – the new stormwater drain was rectangular in shape. This integrated stormwater drain, as a part of the Smart City Mission, linked the stormwater drain network to three river basins and an estuary (Adyar and Cooum basins, the Kosasthalaiyair and Kovalam basins).

Jayaram Vencatesan, Convener of Arappor Iyakkam, a people’s movement working towards transparency and accountability in governance, told Mongabay–India that Arappor had earlier filed Right to Information petitions to ask for project reports on road names where stormwater drains were constructed. They have not received any reply. There is also no map showing the stormwater drain network in the city, he said.

Talking about the recent rains, Venkatesan said that in some parts of the city, the stormwater drains worked because they were about 400 metres to 500 metres from a water body or canal and also, there was a gradient that facilitated the water flow. In other places, the rectangular drains did not work because either they were not connected to water bodies, or they were filled with sediment and garbage including plastic.

According to Venkatesan, after the deluge, the corporation crew were seen pumping the stagnant water into the sewage drains.

According to a news report published last month, Gagandeep Singh Bedi, the Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner, said that he has insisted that changes be made in the SWD design after vetting by Corporation engineers. Bedi said that the recent flooding is not because of the stormwater drain but because the system itself is getting strained.

BHPian grkonweb recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

An Abrupt End to my Hexa Ownership

Earlier this month, with a heavy heart I gave up my beloved Tata Hexa to salvage buyer as the beast got flood damaged and was assessed as total loss by insurance company on the basis of repairs estimate provided by authorized service center.

Back in Nov 2021 we are on a trip to a village near Nagercoil, Kanyakumari for an Ayurvedic treatment, it was raining heavily. Due to flash floods triggered by opening of dam gates upstream overnight, Hexa was submerged in water till tyre level for 3 days. I couldn't move the vehicle to a safer place as it happened overnight and in the morning I was stunned to see the below scene.

We waited for 3 days for the water to recede and thereafter I got it towed to local Tata Authorized Service Station (TASS) at Nagercoil and the repair estimate (mostly connected car spares & electricals like ECU, main wiring kit, etc) exceeded 75% of IDV and hence they pushed for total loss. Since being a true blue beast lover I was not mentally prepared to accept the decision and got the vehicle shipped (in flat bed truck) to Bangalore TASS at my own expense in December for second opinion. I wanted to try my best to save the vehicle and spent Rs 96k from my pocket for this effort.

The local surveyor at Bangalore advised the TASS to first check the engine and automatic transmission are in good condition before proceeding with any repairs. This time it was found the auto tranny got water ingress and the transmission electronic component in question was major replacement cost-wise. The new repair estimate at Bangalore exceeded the IDV! More than the repair cost, what convinced me to give up the car was given the water damage to the auto transmission unit and it would not be reliable especially for my long drives with family. Many of my friends who had experienced water damage in Chennai floods, advised me to give up as they said the car electronics (and reliability) will never be the same even after expensive repairs.

I've owned many cars in the past and I was never emotionally invested in any of them. To me, car is a word but Hexa is an emotion. It was gut wrenching decision to finally agree for total loss and it took all this while to mentally prepare myself (first time when I heard total loss advise from insurance company in Dec, I got angry - so much emotionally attachment to Hexa) and the family too are fond of the beast. Finally, the insurance formalities got completed earlier this month.

This is how my beloved Hexa looked ready to be towed by the salvage buyer...too good to let go!

Few lessons I learnt from this episode which I'm sharing for everyone's benefit:

1. Please do not cut premium costs by reducing IDV (mine was just Rs 7.73 lacs & my repair estimate came up to Rs 7.85 lacs, of course, some components could have been checked & used instead of replacement) especially if your vehicle is 5+ years old. I didn't apply my mind when the insurance came up for renewal last year, I didn't bother much about the reduced IDV and that did me in.

2. If you are in flood prone area, take engine protect cover as well in the insurance. Also opt for return to invoice feature if eligible.

3. Take insurance from TASS as I heard (not sure though) they have big clout with insurance companies to push insurance claim favorable to owners.

4. Take RSA from TASS (I heard, not sure though) which has a feature where there is no limit on distance covered for peace of mind if your vehicle is 5+ years. Of course, extended warranty coverage goes without saying.

5. In case water level is raising and you are unable to move the vehicle to safer place (in my case the road level was lower than the place we were staying and moving out will only make it worse), the best option is to:

(i) disconnect the battery to avoid fouling up with electronics.

(ii) wrap the exhaust pipes with polythene sheets to avoid water ingress

I'm yet to fully come to terms with the abrupt loss (just 40k in odomoter, Sep 2017 XTA model with no prior accident history, maintained passionately) and the vehicle body in pristine condition and engine parts intact. Had it met with accident and body went out of shape it's a different matter. In hindsight, to come to think of it, at least we didn't meet with any accident that would have harmed us physically but Hexa went away intact except for electronic & electrical components.

Tata Hexa was an aspirational vehicle for me and Hexa was all the more special for me personally as I came from buying the cheapest (not in a bad way) car Tata Indica Xeta GLG way back in Sep 2007 and God was kind to me that I could pick up the flagship model in Tata lineup - Tata Hexa XTA (my first automatic, https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/offic...ml#post4262444 (Tata Hexa : Official Review)) in Sep 2017 - in just 10 years. We enjoyed the car, the long drives, admiring looks from people, great memories and the camaraderie of extended Hexa family - Hexatrons Bangalore Group (HBG) and Tata SOUL (SUV Owners United League) group.

Thanks to the brotherhood of HBG and I personally got to know many Hexa owners. Will be missing the breakfast drives and the great conversations & company. The passion for a car, helpful nature of members, bonding over Hexa are all something I experienced first hand thanks to Hexa and I'll remember for long.

Yet I've to move on and I started looking (upon family's insistence) for similar 7 seater full sized SUV and none of the existing models in today's market comes close to Hexa’s ride handling, quality and comfort & at my budget (less than Rs 30 lacs which itself is a big stretch for me). Someway or other the current available line up of 7 seaters seem to be a compromise and they are no match for Hexa in terms of ride quality & tank-like safety IMHO.

What Next?

I did extensive survey of the 7-seater market (family wants next vehicle equivalent to Hexa if not better) and none of the cars match the value, comfort, safety & road presence of Hexa today IMHO. In my survey, I found SUVs either obscenely priced or don't look the part (subjective) or lack certain utility aspects.

Here's a quick review of the SUVs/MUVs I looked at:

Mahindra XUV 700: Nice package with Auto + AWD combo, loaded with tech features to the gills (not sure how they will hold up in the mid to long run plus my experience of how too many electronics if water damaged, will go down the drain). Polarizing looks IMHO (it is subjective) - I don't know how it will age over the next few years, I'm afraid the vehicle might look odd down the years. It costs almost 29 lacs top end AT +AWD at Bangalore on the road price. The biggest downer for me was the insane waiting period of 75 weeks thanks to the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage. Ruled out this beautiful car as I believe I don't have to do tapas to get a vehicle. Reminds me of my Dad's purchase of Bajaj scooter way back in mid-80s thanks to then government policies, production was controlled and waiting period for a Bajaj Chetak was 7 years. He had to settle for a Bajaj Super bought from a broker (technically my Dad was 2nd owner) by paying Rs 7k premium over the price. In this aspect, the more times changes, things remain the same!

MG Hector Plus: Did not want to buy Chinese owned though it is a British brand. Plus the vehicle looked oddly proportioned in certain angles (subjective, no offense to owners). The huge vertical-oriented tablet was a turn off for me as I learn even AC controls are in-built in the unit with no hardware knobs. I believe a driver should not be distracted by such gizmos and his/her focus 100% should be on the road for safety.

Toyota Innova Crysta: Reliable, Resale value, great service center experience, Toyota brand, long engine life (as they say, Toyota outlives its owners!), proven mile muncher were all plus points. But the biggest negative for me was the non-availability of bench seat in 2nd row in the top end ZX AT version. With a kid it is a must for a 2nd row bench seat as it is convenient for her to sleep during long drives. Checked with dealers if seat swap could be done at the dealer level - nope was the answer. At 32 plus lacs on road price at Bangalore, it is an expensive buy which I'm reluctantly OK but the lack of bench seat was a turn off. I'm fine with the lack of creature comforts like panoramic sunroof, connected car features, MPV looks and taxi image but still when it doesn't fulfill my functional requirement, it didn't make the cut.

Ruled out:

1. Kia Carnival - luxurious though, but super expensive for me plus didn't want to drive a van (no offense to owners) and huge size.

2. Hyundai Alcazar - it is a notch down in the pecking order with 1500 cc engine. After using 2000 cc engines for the last 13+ years, I didn't want to downgrade to a lower cc engine.

3. Kia Carens - Same reason as above, both Alcazar and Carens are nice cars which will be appreciated by 1st time owners who upgrade from hatchbacks but when you are used to Hexa-level luxury, they don't make the cut.

4. Mahindra Scorpio (2022 yet to be launched) - This old workhorse was my ride many years ago and I wonder how I put up with the bouncy ride in those days. Heard it is slated for launch in mid-2022 and it is being slotted a notch down Mahindra XUV 700. Not for me!

5. Jeep Meridian - Had a silly wish that this vehicle when launched could be in Rs 30 - 35 lacs price OTR. But nope, heard that it is being slotted in Rs 40 - 45 lacs price range OTR and this is way beyond my budget.

No pre-owned vehicle is preferred by myself & family, so there goes the option of pre-worshipped Hexa.

What I found in my hunt for Hexa replacement was, at Rs 25-29 lac range OTR in Bangalore, very few capable 7 seater SUVs are available suiting my needs. Either a notch below (<20 lacs OTR) or above (>30 lacs OTR) you have options but again they are few. IMO, proper 7 seaters SUVs are available only from Tata & Mahindra stable in Rs 25 to 29 lacs OTR price range.

Finally, after reading the entire threat in this forum, ownership reviews, many Youtube review videos and multiple test drives I booked Tata Safari XZA+ Dark Edition (again a Tata - rather going to be 5th Tata vehicle in our family's ownership history), proves once a Tata customer always a Tata customer! Hoping to take delivery before end of March 2022. Safari is not a perfect replacement for Hexa, for sure there are few features that were not available in Hexa but still I feel Safari is a compromise and not in the league of Hexa. Only Hexa owners will get this. And I know dark colors are a pain to maintain - scratches & dust are visible easily and any dark color is a safety hazard while driving at night especially in highways. I went for dark edition purely for the black seats & interiors (family didn't like Adventure Persona edition Tropical Mist color) as white is super difficult to maintain. I did notice the test drive car front seats were soiled.

In October last year, the State government constituted the committee, which noted that Chennai was prone to natural disasters and cyclones.

Though lessons can be derived from floods in Bengaluru and Gurugram earlier this month, municipal officials in Chennai say they needn’t look anywhere but at the city’s “own past experiences” — floods in 2005, 2015 and intense rainfall last November — that pushed them to brace for flooding on a war footing.

Chennai: For months now, Chennai’s residents have witnessed JCB machines gnawing at their streets, with the municipal authorities keen on executing a city-wide stormwater drain project in a breathless frenzy before the onset of the northeast monsoon.

The number of inundation points will be fewer if Chennai witnesses similar levels of rainfall as last year, GCC Commissioner Gangandeep Singh Bedi told ThePrint. “Even if inundation takes place, evacuation time will be lower,” he said.

Across the city, entire stretches of roads have been dug up on one side to accommodate new drains, reducing the carriageway by half and leading to traffic snarls. “The entire city is dug up and I don’t believe that all the work will get done before the rains arrive,” said an autorickshaw driver.

The GCC’s efforts are, however, not without criticism. In some neighbourhoods including KK Nagar, residents have reportedly voiced concerns over the level of stormwater drains designed by the Indian Institute Of Technology (IIT) Madras, which they say, are higher than that of their homes, making them vulnerable to floodwater.

But municipal authorities say improvements are being made in a multi-pronged manner.

First, the GCC identified various “pain points” based on recommendations made by retired IAS officer V. Thiruppugazh. Funds were then sanctioned by the Tamil Nadu government for the reconstruction of stormwater drains in the core city area where existing drains were inadequate, narrow, or had outlived their utility.

Bedi said that the GCC’s experiences showed that “desilting of channels is very important” and that the municipal body — which used to take up this work two months prior to the arrival of the northeast monsoon — initiated desilting work five months early this year.

“It is about 70-75 per cent complete, and we have about one more month before the rains,” he added.

The GCC is now focused on desilting “pain points” at Buckingham Canal near Basin bridge, Otteri, and at the Virugambakkam canal near the busy Koyambedu bus station.

“One gets a sense that this government has understood the seriousness of the situation. During the last rains, we saw them employ motors and pump water out, across major roads. That even this jugaad management for flooding wasn’t done before is mind-boggling in retrospect,” Chennai-based writer Krupa Ge, author of the book Rivers Remember on the 2015 Chennai floods, told ThePrint.

Ge said it will be “interesting to see” how the new stormwater drain work holds up, adding that there seems to be a “sense of urgency and also understanding of the fact that this isn’t a small-time, ad-hoc problem”.

Chennai Climate Action Plan

With street-by-street interventions to tide over this monsoon season already underway, the GCC also released a draft Chennai Climate Action Plan on its website earlier this month. The document has been placed in the public domain for various stakeholders to give their feedback.

According to the draft, 100 metres of Chennai’s coast is at risk of submersion owing to a projected 7-cm rise in sea level in the next five years. Further, the draft predicts that 30 per cent of Chennai will be at risk of flooding and at least 500 slums will be inundated if the city witnesses heavy rains every five years.

The climate action plan was mapped out by the GCC in collaboration with C40 Cities, which is a network of mayors of nearly 100 cities across the world who come together to confront the climate crisis.

“The Tamil Nadu government is doing a lot of work around climate resilience because it completely understands that, as a coastal state and based on the risk that the city and state have already faced, the climate is a priority,” said Shruti Narayan, regional director (South and West Asia) at C40 Cities.

Narayan said this is the “first time” that Chennai is bringing together “multiple actions it may have taken on climate, from different sectors, under one umbrella of the climate action plan”.

“The climate action plan helps to think through that with very detailed stakeholder consultations. It builds on data, develops actions, and looks at what cities can propose for the future. It plans to look at emissions in a data-driven way to look at its impact,” she added.

Chennai-based environmentalist Pooja Kumar said her organisation, Coastal Resources Centre, is in the process of submitting detailed feedback on the GCC’s climate action plan. Kumar, however, added that the GCC’s plan points out that physical infrastructure, including 67 per cent of power plants, will be submerged due to the rise in sea level.

“In addition to that, 89 per cent of CMRL [Chennai Metro Rail Limited] stations are in danger of submergence. This is concerning as there is a need to conduct a serious risk assessment before we begin constructing public infrastructure using public money,” she told The Print.

Kumar said urban health centres, too, are at risk of submergence. “This is concerning as hospitals and public health facilities are first responders. Immediate vulnerability assessments have to be conducted to develop a road map for resilience building,” she added.

“Public health is at most risk due to climate change, and the city action plan must align with the state action plan on climate change that is currently under preparation by the National Health Mission Tamil Nadu. Unfortunately, NHM-TN has been kept out of these negotiations and has not been identified as a stakeholder. Multiple action plans in silos will lead to non-implementation and tightened risk,” Kumar warned.

Meanwhile, the GCC commissioner said that the civic body gets “lots of comments on social media, especially on safety aspects” which keeps the civic body on its toes. “This is our last month before the rains; our focus is on completion of drains and restoring the roads,” he told ThePrint.

Excess flooding in the city has been associated with poor planning and urban development projects over the years. Rapid urbanisation in erstwhile agricultural lands and wetlands, and increased concretisation have altered the natural flow of rainwater. This is what has often led to debilitating floods.

Existing infrastructure to manage flooding has been criticised by city dwellers and environmentalists for incomplete construction, lack of topographic study before implementation, and lack of linking drains to natural channels.

A growing concern is the fact that such measures are not ‘environmentally sustainable’ – while importance is given to draining away water from flooded areas via storm water drains (SWDs), there is not much attention paid to conserving and repurposing the water. Current measures such as SWDs, gutters and pumps, are often dubbed as ‘grey’ measures’.

Read more: All that’s wrong with stormwater drains in Chennai and how to fix them

Many are now pointing to ‘nature based solutions’ (NBS) — dubbed as ‘green and blue’ infrastructure — as a key alternative or complementary measure, to mitigate the effects of floods in the city. Before we elaborate on this, we need to first understand the existing modes in place for flood management in the city.

Existing flood management infrastructure

The storm water drain (SWD) networks consist of a set of pipes which carry run-off stormwater to nearby water bodies such as rivers, lakes, ponds and the sea. Many of these drains are to be connected to natural canals, which then feed into the main water bodies. These canals include the Otteri Nullah in Kilpauk, Mambalam Drain, PT Rajan Salai canal, Mirigambakkam Canal, Captain Cotton canal, Buckingham Canal, etc. Many of these are older man-made channels constructed along the natural slopes in the topography. They usually range from 20 ft to 50 ft in width, however their size has decreased over the years, and many have become choked with waste.

As of January 2021, the corporation has constructed 8,835 drains spanning an area of 2051 square km. A portion of these drain networks were constructed under public-private partnership projects such as JNNURM, Chennai Mega City Development Mission, Integrated Storm Water Drain Project and Smart City Project. They have been criticised for faulty execution as existing SWDs were allegedly destroyed with new ones being built over them as part of these projects. Activists have highlighted how, despite publicity and huge investments in constructing these networks, many of the areas that came under these projects were water-logged during last year’s downpour.

In addition to SWDs, pumps are also commonly used in heavily flooded areas. Rainwater harvesting, formation of community tanks and wetland restoration are also key measures adopted as part of flood management systems.

How do these fall short?

Dayanand Krishnan, a GIS consultant and member of civic action group, Chitlapakkam Rising, mentions how flood management and general urban planning do not prioritise recharging of the ground i.e. allowing water to percolate into the ground for storage and repurposing. This can be seen in how the majority of funds have historically been allocated for SWD projects, even in areas that do not even require such infrastructure, as was the case along the sandy Kottivakkam-Uthandi stretch.

The same is reflected in a 2019 report on Chennai’s water system by the Chennai Resilience Center: “Flood management in Chennai has not been thought about in an integrated manner that incorporates rain water harvesting, recognition of natural sinks and marshlands and contributions of the traditional eri (or tank) system to underground recharge.”

Dayanand explains how even in streets where these drains are required, the SWD system has often led to large scale wastage of water and has exacerbated flooding. This is because there is an uncontrolled flow of storm water into the SWDs that were initially built to hold much lower volumes of storm water inflow. Ultimately the rainwater is lost to the sea or stagnates in floods, and there is no proper cycle that allows for using the water.

While desalination plants are constructed outside the city to recycle and supply water, these are high cost, high energy projects especially considering the amount of transportation of water that is required.

Nature based solutions as an alternative

Nature based solutions or ‘ecosystem-based adaptation’ measures propose to make use of natural processes and ecosystems for reducing the effects of natural disasters such as floods, landslides, erosion and drought. These can either be completely green — consisting of only ecosystem elements, or hybrid — a combination of ecosystem elements and hard or ‘grey’ engineering services. These solutions are becoming popular in megacities and wealthier countries, and are often adopted in the name of sustainable development and planning, in urban landscapes.

As explained in the website of City of 1000 tanks, a Chennai-based multi-stakeholder NBS project, nature based solutions are specifically engineered to absorb and filter pollutants through organic and mechanical devices. The approach has been developed as a means to address climate change adaptation in densely urban areas.

Use of blue-green infrastructure for flood management has taken place in many other urban landscapes. For example, in Dresden Germany, a network of urban community gardens are being built to help increase water retention and conservation in densely urban areas. In Chicago, greening of rooftops has been adopted and has managed to prevent storm water runoff by 30%. Sheffield has recently incorporated permeable pavements along with retention sumps, bioswales, perforated underdrains, and rain gardens to increase natural absorption and collection. Conversion of open spaces into parks for absorption of rainwater has been done in a number of cities such as Paris, Singapore, Rotterdam and New Orleans. Bethenheim Water Square in Rotterdam is a key example of an integrated blue-green and grey flood management system. The park is a conventional play and sports area with a porous surface also acting as a storm water catch basin.

Implementing nature-based solutions: Where does Chennai stand?

In terms of sustainable and effective solutions that could be applied in Chennai, Dayanand suggests methods similar to Singapore’s rain garden model where there is importance given to recharging of the ground and harvesting of water in development projects.

Dayanand suggests that city planning should also naturally account for water retention: “When the CMDA gives a new development plan where they list a new Open Space Reserve (OSR), they should give a condition to have a water body. Instead of completely converting it into a park, they can partially allocate around 25% of the area for constructing a pond.”

According to Eva Pfannes, from City of 1000 tanks, as the city becomes more dense, space needs to be given for nature and water in the urban landscape, so as to allow for rainwater to come full circle. In the past, Chennai was able to do this through the use of the traditional eri system, presence of wetlands, and due to a much lower population density. Presently, however, space for collection of rainwater is not given much priority in the city.

City of 1000 Tanks aims to revive traditional systems such as temple tanks and eris, and provide space for existing sandy ground to absorb water. On speaking to members of OOZE (a Netherlands-based collective of architects and urbanists, part of the City of 1000 Tanks project), they stressed upon the importance of existing systems in place. “We are trying to combine both: ancient knowledge (eris and temple tanks), nature based solutions and the current functioning of the city,” said Eva.

One of the ongoing flagship projects of the organisation is reviving the Mylapore Temple tank system. The tanks ideally function as effective water recharge systems, as they collect water which is then recharged into Mylapore’s sandy layer. The sand filters the water prior to recharge. The project has developed a design to revive two temple tanks, transform open spaces into new tanks, and connect these via a network of nature based infrastructure along streets and roads.

A large part of designing involved research and interaction with communities living in the area. The organisation spoke to many street vendors, to see if these solutions could co-exist with those who move in and out of the area, and to even see if jobs could be created in the maintenance of these nature based solutions.

“Decentralisation really makes people the owners of these resources. When water is recycled and managed, it is owned by an external entity. When people can see these systems and can manage them, they are empowered to be in charge of these resources. they don’t have to depend on the government or a private entity for the maintenance of NBS.” – Hsoc Mathai George of OOZE Architects

City of 1000 Tanks is also working on a pilot project to test NBS solutions in the Little Flower Convent in Mambalam. It is an ongoing project that aims to pilot a Chennai specific water balance model to be upscaled to different parts of the city. The model consists of septic tanks, constructed wetlands, bioswales and detention parks. In addition to rainwater harvesting measures, the pilot project gives importance to constructed wetlands with reeds for treatment of wastewater collected in open spaces. The school could potentially benefit by receiving 2500 litres of water per day, as a result.

The organisation is working on a number of other NBS projects as well, such as providing water collection and in-situ NBS for sewage treatment in the Chitra Nagar-Kotturpuram informal settlements along the banks of the Adyar river; stormwater absorption measures in Koyambedu market, and many more.

What should be kept in mind?

An important principle of nature-based flood management is the integration of the natural ecosystem in the flood management process. However, it calls for proper assessment of local environmental conditions and topography. For example, attempts at restoration and flood mitigation via planting of exotic species have led to adverse effects in certain ecosystems.

For example, planting mangroves to reduce storm surges and reduce flood risk is a common NBS approach. However, if they are planted in areas where mangroves don’t grow naturally, for example in seagrass ecosystems, they can cause harm to the local ecosystem, as they are planted on feeding areas for dugongs and in the living area for fish, shellfish and shore birds.

Giriraj Amarnath, a research lead specialising in water risk management at the International Water Management Institute, also stresses on the importance of “co-development with human systems” in implementing these solutions. “People need to be encouraged to participate in the process, not just the NGOs or government officials. These solutions should be based on the needs and capacities of communities (living in the concerned areas) in terms of how waste water could be reduced and reused for example”.

Giriraj also mentions how flood management solutions need to be planned for the long term, so as to adapt to climate change-induced disasters and environmental conditions.

“Nature based solutions should be planned for the next three to four decades. It cannot be simply an ad hoc investment. It (NBS) also cannot just look at flood management alone. Instead, stakeholders must consider a collective approach. Planning should include questions about how populations can be empowered to implement and maintain blue green infrastructure, how sustainability can be achieved on a long term basis, how different departments/sectors can come together in the process.”

In Chennai, it was around 1km into the land while at Visakhapatnam, water entered only 500m. It depends on the topography.If the terrain is flat, water travels more into land than compared to an incline off the shore,” said INCOIS scientistAjay Kumar B.According to the study, northern suburbs like Pazhaverkadu, which has Pulicat lake, may see inundation of up to 1m beyond 1km into the land and 1m to 3m water level near the coast.Similarly, up to 200m of land from Besant Nagar up to Panaiyur along East Coast Road may go under 2-3m water. From Uthandi to Muttukadu water may go up to 3m up to 500m into land.Some places in and around Mamallapuram and Salavankuppam may go under 2m water depth up to 1km into the land. Beyond that, much of East Coast Road is likely to face inundation of 2m to 3m along the coast.NCCR director M V Ramana Murthy said they run a numerical model with probable earthquake scenarios to compute the wave height at the source (epicentre) and calculate its impact as it reaches the coast, for which data on the topography, physical features of the coast and sea bathymetry are taken into account.“In the delta regions of the state, wave height might be amplified and cause more inundation as the seabed bathymetry in these areas have a mild slope,” he said.So, will the 2004-tsunami happen again on the east coast? INCOIS scientists say there are chances of an earthquake of nearly 8m in Andaman and Nicobar as quakes of 8m have a return period of 100 years +20 years. The last quake of 7. 9m in Andaman and Nicobar was in 1881 that triggered a tsunami.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Residents in many parts of north Chennai, which are traditionally prone to waterlogging, woke up to dry roads or partially waterlogged stretches on Saturday. Most parts of Pulianthope, Pattalam, Vyasarpadi, Perambur and Tiruvottiyur were largely free of water stagnation.

According to officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation, there was no major water stagnation in the five zones of the northern region such as Tiruvottiyur, Manali, Madhavaram, Tondiarpet and Royapuram. An assessment found that around 78 small and medium trees and 103 branches had fallen. Three streetlight poles and a traffic signal were damaged.

Ganeshapuram subway in Vyasarpadi, which goes under water after almost every rain bringing traffic to a halt, had no waterlogging. Similarly, Perambur Barracks Road, another traditionally flood-prone stretch, had no water stagnation. Pattalam, which gets heavily flooded, had very little water stagnation.

Dr. Ambedkar College Road in Pulianthope had partial waterlogging, and the bad condition of portions of the stretch made it difficult for road users.

One of the affected areas in Pulianthope was Decaster Road and its interior lanes. The area that already faces poor sanitation turned into a mess due to partial waterlogging.

Malathi, a long-time resident said, “Decaster Road is prone to waterlogging after every rain. But the situation has improved in the last two times when it rained heavily. Earlier, water used to stagnate for two or three days with no place to drain and turn black in colour. Now, though water stagnates to an extent, it is immediately pumped out. But we want a permanent solution. The Corporation should identify the problem and rectify it,” she said.

Like in Decaster Road, the workforce and machinery was deployed in places where there was partial waterlogging. Another such area was A.B.V. Koil Street in G.K.M. Colony. Residents said there was waterlogging in parts of Kamarajar Nagar, Nehruji Nagar and Chinnasamy Nagar in Manali zone and was being pumped out.

The narrow rail underpass in Mettupalayam was waterlogged as usual. Kumar, a resident, said residents travelled through the underpass to reach Arunthathiyar Nagar or else had to take a detour of 1.5 km.

While most parts of north Chennai escaped from flooding, bad road conditions gave a tough time to motorists, including on segments of Ennore High Road, T.H. Road in Tondiarpet and New Washermenpet.

Innovate steps

An official of the Corporation’s north region said they took a number of innovative steps and applied them according to the needs of each area.

While new storm-water drains (SWD) helped, he said precast box culverts were put in place in 34 places in the region where the road levels were higher, automatic pumping stations in six places, electrical motors were deployed and major canals such as Captain Cotton Canal, Kodungaiyur Canal and Buckingham Canal desilted.

As a solution for reverse flow of water that usually inundated residential areas, easy-to-operate shutters were put in place at outfall points of storm-water drains in canals. Sumps were built alongside the drain to pump out water, he said and added that such a mechanism was put in place at 20 places, including in parts of Tondiarpet zone in M.G.R. Nagar, Nethaji Nagar and Thendral Nagar.

Places such as Mudichur and Semmanchery in south Chennai did not get flooded during Cyclone Mandous despite continuous rain since Friday evening, thanks to work undertaken by various departments, said residents.

At Mudichur, which has witnessed heavy water-logging several times in the past, residents said that there was no major flooding.

P. Damodaran of Federation of Mudichur Residential Welfare Associations said that since a storm-water drain was constructed a few months ago from Madhanapuram to the Adyar river and completed much ahead of the monsoon, it helped reduce flooding considerably. “There were small stagnations here and there but in such locations too water flowed out very quickly,” he said. Another resident said that the widening of the Adyar river helped.

At Semmanchery, where images of provisions being supplied to residents by earthmovers still remain fresh in many peoples’ minds, copious amounts of water drained via the still under-construction twin macro drains on the DLF Road and connected to the nearby canal.

In many places such as streets off the East Coast Road, Rajiv Gandhi Salai, Velachery and Adyar, residents said that the strong winds had brought down a number of trees and branches but there was not much flooding.

Highways Minister E.V. Velu, who visited various locations in the city, advised officials to ensure that there was no hindrance to flow in storm-water drains. Greater Chennai Corporation officials said that although some water entered a few fishing huts such as Sreenivasapuram, there were no major prolonged inundations as such in the southern region.

However, the salt pans of Kovalam off Rajiv Gandhi Salai were flooded. “These are vast low-lying areas where flood waters from nearby areas run into. We have water standing up to four feet and our bunds and internal roads have been destroyed. We have to wait for the water to recede naturally to resume work. It will take till after Pongal for that and we have to spend on rebuilding the bunds and roads. If the government can take some steps to divert the waters, it would help,” said a worker at one of the salt pans.",solution,Cyclone Mandous,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu","December 10, 2022","December 11, 2022","['Mudichur', 'Semmanchery', 'Kovalam']","['100 mm, 150 mm, 200 mm']","['Flooding', 'Trees and branches down', 'Salt pans flooded']",0,"['Loss of property', 'Disruption of transportation', 'Damage to crops']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The relentless showers had caused much misery to the residents, with many claiming to have remained starved for days amid accumulated water in their neighbourbood. Several people fell sick due to the sewage-mixed rainwater and residents from all pockets complained of leeches and centipedes all over their homes.

Three months later, although the water has long receded, the problems arising from the damages due to the rains are far from getting over. From damaged storm water drains and frequent power cuts to broken roads, poor maintenance of public toilets and excess pollution, there seems to be no end to the woes.

Among other areas, those falling under the Thiru Vi Ka Nagar zone of the Greater Chennai Corporation seems to be the worst affected. Under this zone, the Perambur Barracks Road in Pattalam area near Puraswalkam remained underwater for more than a week in November. The issue, a recurring one for ages now, has not been resolved despite assurances from political parties during the elections, say the residents.

“We are unable to live in peace during the monsoons. Children and old-aged people suffer a lot as we have barely anything to eat for a few days. Another major issue is the frequent power cuts — these days they are happening even on non-rainy days. Every year during the rainy season our work gets affected. At least 10-15 days we are forced to remain indoors which eventually affects our livelihood,” she said.

In a message to the government, Gangamma added, “Please help us, do something to drain out the water during the rainy season.”

Athilakshmi, who works at the Government Rajaji Hospital, said there is no way for the water to go out. In her neighbourhood, she said, many had not gone to work for a month and youngsters who completed Class XII are now going for daily wage work as their families are not in a position to pay the college fees.

She added, “The Anjaneyar Temple is a landmark of the Pattalam area. A canal passes from behind the temple and by throwing garbage and other items in it, the residents have completely choked it. No one is cleaning the blockage. The area is covered in a cloud of dust and filled with garbage. During the floods in November, the water had reached up to my hip but since I work in the healthcare sector, I had to go to work. No politicians visited our area. They had come till the main road and left.”

Athilakshmi further said, “We struggle during every rainy season. Ruling party leaders come once during the monsoons and distribute bread packets to the residents and think their responsibility is over. I have seen people not being able to go to work for over a month due to the rains.”

If the monsoons restrict residents at home, the summers see frequent power cuts in these areas. The residents say between April and June, at least 10 days each month the power goes off by 1 am and comes back only in the morning around 6 am.

Residents said CM and the other ministers had promised to improve the infrastructure in the area but nothing has been done so far. Residents said CM and the other ministers had promised to improve the infrastructure in the area but nothing has been done so far.

Rakesh, who supplies cans of drinking water and lives in Pulianthope area, said, “When it rains, the area is filled with thick black sewage water. We have got used to it as we have no option but when outsiders visit the area, they get shocked and ask us how we survive in this condition.”

He added, “The streets get waterlogged even if it rains for just one hour. The corporation does pump out the water using high power motors but the situation is the same when it rains again. Candidates who are contesting in the urban local body polls have visited our area and have promised to resolve the issues but they won’t show their faces after the election. We have seen it all in the last 10-15 years.”

Ankaiah (74), a retired superintendent of Madras University, who has been residing in Pulianthope area for over 60 years now, said during the 2015 floods, the water level had risen to eight feet and it took the corporation close to 15 days to pump out the stagnated water. During the last floods, the water level rose to five feet, he added.

Three months later, although the water has long receded, the problems arising from the damages due to the rains are far from getting over. Three months later, although the water has long receded, the problems arising from the damages due to the rains are far from getting over.

“People residing here should pray to God that no one in their families have any medical emergency during the monsoon because if that happens, there will be no one to help them. Nobody can come out of the streets and there are no transport facilities. I don’t have memories of the government laying proper roads in this area in all these years. We saw in the news that the government has sanctioned some crores of rupees to provide a makeover to Pulianthope and its surrounding areas but nothing has been done yet,” he said.

Govindaraj (62), who worked as a driver in the Chennai Corporation, said people do not want to take up houses on rent in the area due to these issues. He also claimed that due to the construction of a mega apartment in the locality, the stagnated water in the apartment is being diverted to their roads through huge pipes and since people who are associated with the apartment have influence with major political parties, the others are unable to question them.

“We are scared of the rain. When I was young, I would wait for the monsoons so that I could enjoy the rains but now I don’t want to see it at all. On rainy days, the entire stretch from the Hanuman temple looks like a sea. We cannot go out for any function or visit any place during that time. This causes depression among the residents; it takes a toll on their physical and mental health. People fall sick due to dengue and other diseases,” he said.

Rajesh, who works at a grocery store, said since the roads are very narrow, traffic congestion is a huge problem and the pollution from the vehicles also causes health hazards. He said the residents are hoping that the upcoming flyover will reduce the traffic jam in the area.

In January, the Greater Chennai Corporation announced that three new flyovers would be constructed to reduce the traffic congestion. The flyovers would be coming up at Ganesapuram subway, at the intersection of the Konnur High Road and Strahans Road and at South Usman Road at a total estimated cost of Rs 335 crore.

The Konnur High Road is a crucial point connecting Villivakkam, Perambur Jamalia via Cooks Road, Pattalam via Strahans Road and Purasawalkam via Brickkiln Road. The new flyover here is set to be built at a cost of Rs 62 crore. The two-lane bidirectional flyover would be 508-metre-long and 8.4-metre-wide.

After the 2015 deluge, Chennai has come to fear the fury of the northeast monsoon. Last year’s rains only exacerbated apprehensions of the city’s residents, as even core parts of the city were inundated for days, despite relatively lower amounts of rainfall. Chennai Corporation officials say that this year, the total rainfall in many areas was nearly 33 cm in a three-day period, whereas last year, the city was inundated during a three-day rain period in November, with only 17 cm of rainfall.

Some intense showers over a 24-hour period in north Chennai this time around, resulted in over 30 cm of rainwater. Though the rainfall itself came in bursts, thanks to staggered showers, the Greater Chennai Corporation, with its extensive stormwater drain work this year, might have just yet won the first round.

It had to. The flooding and failure of the last monsoon, could be laid at the door of the AIADMK government that had just been voted out. But no longer, and certainly not this year, when Corporation Councillors had been elected after a gap of a decade, and were directly answerable to the residents of Chennai.

The DMK has a reputation of enhancing city infrastructure in Chennai every time it is in power. The city got a veteran bureaucrat in Gagandeep Singh Bedi as Corporation Commissioner, and work towards flood prevention was set in motion with Chief Minister M.K. Stalin holding meetings and inspecting ground work, as the drain infrastructure was found to be in shambles.

Re-engineering work

After the first spells, the efforts of the government seem to have paid off, as traditional flooding hotspots remained drained, and flooding was restricted mainly to parts of North Chennai. This year, the Corporation focussed on engineering, bringing technology including precast causeways, modern machinery for cementing walls and top slabs, increasing the number of manholes for better flow and to facilitate better desilting, and reducing the distance between manholes from 5 metres to 2.5 metres.

“Immediately after the 2021 December rains, we noted down the main areas [of flooding]. In January the feedback from the Thiruppugazh committee [an advisory panel on mitigation and management of flood risks in the city] was available. In the next two months, we prepared the estimates, got it vetted by the committee, called for tenders and issued the work orders in April,” Mr. Bedi explained.

“Smaller projects usually take about 12 months and bigger projects in north and south Chennai will take three to four years to set right. But in this case, we have finished most of the smaller projects in six months, having started in April. This was possible because of political will, a series of coordination meetings with line departments, close inspections and technical follow-up of the quality of the work thrice a week. We also got the feedback from a technical team led by IIT Madras,” he said.

The seat of the local body -- Ripon Building was not flooded this year. Nor were core areas including T. Nagar, Adyar, Mylapore, Ashok Nagar and Velachery. Another aspect that has helped, is the constant feedback from the elected representatives – councillors.

In South Chennai, the Kovalam project was taken up with German funding of ₹150 crore, and the work done so far has helped to an extent. The Water Resources Department has also issued a new standard operating procedure for preemptive release of water from eight tanks in areas such as Korattur, Porur, Ambattur and Kolathur during the monsoon to prevent flooding. The Highways Department has done its bit in areas like Kasi Theater to Adyar and WallTax Road.

“The fear factor which used to be in the minds of the people has all gone and the city is much better, normal life has resumed. There is further [work] to be done to make the city more resilient. You know Rome cannot be built in a day. It takes time to build infrastructure,” says Mr. Bedi.

‘Too early to judge’

The consensus amongst residents is that it is still too early to judge the effectiveness of the Corporation’s work towards the monsoon. Residents believe that a better comparison with the 2021 monsoon can be made in a few weeks. However, in the showers the city has received till now, some areas have fared better than they did last year and others have continued to remain prone to water-logging.

It is true that Metro Rail construction work and other civic projects across the city have exacerbated the situation, resulting in slush and rough roads, and restricted access. Another common problem that has resulted in water entering residential compounds is the higher level of the roads as compared to houses.

“Repeated re-laying of the roads has resulted in even the stormwater drains being at a higher level than our houses,” says C. Ramakrishnan, president, Federation of Adyar Residents Associations. This makes it difficult for the water to drain and could lead to a mixing of sewage and rainwater.

V.S. Jayaraman brings up the same issue in T. Nagar which consists of older residential buildings. “When I moved into my apartment 40 years ago, the road was four feet lower than the building but now it is the opposite,” he says. During the 2021 monsoon, he was forced to relocate temporarily, as water had entered his ground floor apartment. According to him, the stormwater drains have improved the situation but it is “too early to tell”.

Ramanathan Jayaraman, a resident of Arcot Road, Vadapalani says that the road, which is an important arterial road, is full of potholes and floods very quickly. “We still have no traffic management and it takes an hour to travel one kilometre,” he says.

Year after year, North Chennai has fallen prey to waterlogging and it came as no surprise to its residents that the same happened this year. Just two days of rainfall severely affected Strahans Road, Angalamman Koil Street, Thiruvika Nagar and Kolathur with water reaching knee-level, and only extensive pumping helped.

On the other hand, West Mambalam has seen a shift. “From having roads untraversable to only a few pockets of stagnation because of sloping roads, the situation has definitely improved”, says Raja Ram, a resident of Vivekandapuram 1st street, West Mambalam. He noted that Corporation officials responded to complaints and cleared water with pumps.

S.V. Radhakrishnan, a resident of NTR Street, Rangarajapuram, says the stormwater drain there has no exit route and overflows onto the road. This comes after the Corporation made changes to it post the 2021 monsoon. “Water is regularly pumped out but we need a permanent solution”, he says.

Going social

If one were to point to one aspect in which the Chennai Corporation has definitely improved, it would be their response on social media or on the field. Residents merely have to tag @chennaicorp and within a short while, they receive a reply followed by swift action.

With over 20,000 workers on the field actively pumping water or clearing complaints, the Corporation is making significant strides towards addressing issues across the city. Regular inspections by Corporation and government officials have kept them abreast with the city-wide status.

Delayed monsoon

Though delayed by nine days, the Northeast Monsoon (NEM) that started on October 29 this year, has had a good run so far. The Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai has predicted a normal season.

Additional Director General of Meteorology, RMC, Chennai, S. Balachandran said that during the period October 1 to November 1, Chennai had received 413 mm as against its usual 327 mm, which was an increase of 27%.

Senior meteorologist Y. E.A. Raj said that this year, the NEM has made a good beginning. “Sometimes if the onset is very weak it will cause a lot of concern to water managers. Though the monsoon was late, the city had good rains in October. Though the delayed monsoon had caused a deficit in rainfall for the city, this has been corrected in the last few days of the rains,” he said.

As to why the northern parts of the city got more rains than the rest, he said that cannot be explained as rainfall was a very complicated parameter. “In the past too, we have had instances of either Nungambakkam station recording more rainfall than Meenambakkam station or the other way around. But the patterns will get corrected in due course.”

Preparedness pays

The Electricity Department was directed to depute a team of officials to monitor the situation round-the-clock and to attend to faults that occur during the monsoon, and also to disconnect power in flooded areas.

A senior official of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) said the Department had started a number of projects for an accident-free monsoon by pruning tree branches, replacing old and damaged poles, tightening the sagging of overhead power lines, increasing the height of pillar boxes and installing new jumpers.

Maintenance work was carried out in more than 330 substations, while 45,672 trees were pruned, 4,725 old poles were replaced, 13,934 insulators were installed, aged conductors for a length of 1,300 kilometres were replaced and maintenance work was carried out in 1,920 distribution transformers.

Waterlogging was present in many places, but not sufficient to affect traffic flow in these areas, said Additional Commissioner of Police, Traffic, Kapilkumar C. Saratkar.

Only three subways were closed for traffic due to waterlogging. “Coordinating with Corporation, we ensured the movement of traffic even in waterlogged roads, even in the nights, by posting personnel,” he said. Mobilising available resources, the police are working hard to fill potholes developed due to the rain, he added.

Ahead of the monsoon, Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) is preparing to install flood-proof doors in select underground stations in the phase I and phase I extension projects. In the seven years since the Metro began operations, its stations have suffered from leakages and even flooding during heavy showers.

According to CMRL officials, they have floated bids to install flood-proof doors in five underground stations — Saidapet, Anna Nagar East, Thousand Lights, Tondiarpet and Sir Theagaraya College. Last year, they installed the 1-1.2-m-tall doors in a few stations, including Government Estate and AG-DMS, on a pilot basis.

“While there were a few issues concerning the entry of water into stations each year, we noticed it was worse last year. If we receive over 10-15 cm of rain in a day, water gushes into the stations. Hence, we wanted this facility to be in place at five more stations, where we face this issue, before the monsoon this year. In each of these stations, we have identified multiple spots where the contractor will have to install these doors,” an official said.

The doors would be integrated into the entry/exit points to enable quick installation and removal, officials said.

In 2015, the tunnels of the under-construction Saidapet station, located very close to Adyar river, carried flood water to many parts and created several issues. After that, rainwater has entered a few underground stations, including Government Estate, Anna Nagar East and AG-DMS, on numerous occasions.",solution,Chennai Metro Floods,"Chennai, India",2015,Present,"['Saidapet', 'Anna Nagar East', 'Thousand Lights', 'Tondiarpet', 'Sir Theagaraya College']",['10-15 cm'],['Water gushes into stations'],['0'],['Multiple issues'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The southern suburbs along the Adyar river may not face flooding this monsoon as the Water Resources Department (WRD) has expedited the construction of a diversion channel from Somangalam tributary-Adyar confluence point.

The channel is expected to divert excess water from this point to the downstream portion of the Adyar river near Vandalur-Walajabad Road.

Nearly 40% of the work on the channel has been completed. The department plans to complete the work ahead of the monsoon.

Every monsoon, areas like Mahalakshmi Nagar, Ashtalakshmi Nagar in Varadharajapuram and West Tambaram that are at a lower altitude than the Adyar get flooded whenever the river flows at its maximum level. Officials said the channel would carry a portion of surplus water of 1,000 cusecs to downstream where the river was wider. This would prevent flooding of neighbouring areas.

Surplus water of several tanks and tributaries upstream join the river. However, the culvert capacity was inadequate near these flood-prone areas along the Outer Ring Road.

About ₹70 crore would include work to increase the depth and enhance the flood-carrying capacity of the river for 13.2 km. The department will be spending a share of the project cost on strengthening the bund and on building flood protection walls, particularly between Adanur and Tiruneermalai.

These works would prevent breaches in the river during heavy flow in the waterway. Dense rocks in the riverbed in the upstream portion would be cut to facilitate smooth flow.

The total damage to crops, houses and public utilities during the floods in 2018 and 2019 in Tamil Nadu stood at ₹3,500 crore and ₹1.20 crore respectively, according to data provided in the Lok Sabha by Union Minister of State for Jal Shakti Bishweswar Tudu.

Responding to a question raised by Salem MP S.R. Parthiban of the DMK, the Minister said that in 2018, around 2.20 lakh houses were damaged, 52 human lives were lost and 1,040 head of cattle was lost. In 2019, around 2,814 houses were damaged, 10 lives were lost and 230 head of cattle was lost. According to the Minister, the damage from the floods in 2020 had not been reported by the Tamil Nadu government. The data on damage due to heavy rain and floods are compiled by the Central Water Commission (CWC) on receipt of confirmation from the States.

To a question on the steps taken or being taken by the government to prevent such losses and protect the livelihoods in future, Mr. Tudu responded that the CWC’s flood forecasting network had been expanded to 331 flood forecast stations (199 level forecast for villages/towns on the bank of the rivers and 132 inflow forecast stations for dams and barrages) covering 23 States and 2 Union Territories in 20 river basins. This would help the States take proper mitigation measures. In order to provide more lead time to the local authorities to plan evacuation of people and remedial measures, the CWC had developed a basin-wise flood forecasting model. “In the State of Tamil Nadu, the CWC operates four flood level forecasting sites and 11 inflow forecasting sites,” he said.",flood,2018 Tamil Nadu floods,"Tamil Nadu, India",December 2018,January 2019,23 districts,"1,000 mm","{'crops': '₹3,500 crore', 'houses': '2.20 lakh houses', 'public utilities': '₹1.20 crore', 'human lives': '52', 'head of cattle': '1,040'}",,10 lakh people were displaced,"{'flood forecasting network': '331 flood forecast stations', 'basin-wise flood forecasting model': 'developed'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

In 2021, floods ravaged the city once again, but the effects weren’t quite as bad as 2015. While estimates of the economic damage haven’t been cited; the city was at a standstill. Power had been cut, infrastructure damaged, and the collective sanity of the residents was at a low. These were dark times.

Oddly, only two years before, in 2019, Chennai faced an acute water shortage because of a monsoon that failed to spill any rain. This chain of events illustrates a water paradox arising from irregular monsoons, but it also raises several questions.

Why isn’t water stored from heavy rains and why is it being allowed to run, unused into the sea?

Our ancestors didn’t allow this. They built crescent shaped bunds (or mounds) to trap water so it wouldn’t be wasted. We now call these structures Eris (man-made lakes), and it is central in Tamil culture. Eris still exist, obviously, but the lack of understanding of terrain and hydrology by modern planners and the public has dismantled the system and reduced its efficacy.

The graph above illustrates annual rainfall from 2000-2021. The variability in rainfall has been clear for 20 years. Authorities and the public need to account for it in planning activities. Data for graph IMD; Graph made by Kedaravindan Bhaskar

Purpose of empty plots

Traditionally, empty land was left in areas adjoining Eris. These areas are flood prone during heavy rains and they were purposely left unconstructed. Now, the desire to develop has taken precedence over the safety of humans. The manner in which planning and development occurs has little regard for nature and this has cost us. We have built residences and IT hubs over hydrological flows and to compound the issue, we cover every inch of soil in impermeable concrete, so where is water to go?

Changes in built-up (in red) and wetland area (in blue). The image on the left is from 1997 and the image on the right is from 2010, Houses and offices have been built over wetlands and hence get flooded.

In cities land is a scarce commodity. It’s a crime to leave it (nearly) purposeless. In their current state, empty plots serve a fraction of their potential service and are an eyesore and a burden. They are scattered with garbage and rubble and often overrun by prosopis juliflora – an aggressively growing invasive plant. Still, they are of some service. From experience, empty plots are the first to get flooded and this is a good thing.

Surrounding areas are constantly raised which means water flows and inundates them. They provide a space for the water to go – already acting as a bit of a flood buffer. These plots should remain at a shallower elevation than their surrounds and this is the first thing that should be incentivised.

Empowering communities

Land and Eri restoration has been quite common in Chennai and they have been successful in reducing local flooding but (most of) these are tailored to the middle and upper class as opportunities for recreation rather than a mechanism to empower communities.

Without community empowerment, flood prevention will always have to be handled by the state, parastatal bodies and NGOs and never the public. Some form of classism in water restoration efforts will become inevitable and benefits from restoration will be highly local and temporary.

Beyond the services it provides for flood and heat buffering, empty plots can be seen as an opportunity to empower the community by providing livelihoods such as urban agriculture and fisheries.

Incentives to landholders

To kickstart the development of empty plots, incentivisation is required. Carbon credits and tax exemptions are offered commonly to motivate sustainable behaviour. Increasing green spaces, in addition to the benefits it already has, can help Chennai qualify for carbon credits and other grants.

Leasing out land can also tie with a condition for discounted solar energy.

Incentives for land users

Grants will be required during the developmental stages of the empty plots until such time the restoration starts yielding returns but to truly empower and enable the broader community, the land needs to serve livelihoods.

Small transformations to the landscape, for example, the construction of a bund to create a small pond, can serve fishermen who can now rely upon these empty plots for some income. As a bonus, rainwater gets stored, and flooding is reduced.

Like this, several land use cases can be made, not only for flood mitigation but for other urban problems.

For such efforts to succeed, deep understanding of the community is required. Their skillset should be identified and nurtured. There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ plan: the use of empty plots (besides flood reduction) is entirely dependent on the spatial and community context.

The way forward

What can be done immediately is to identify a place to pilot the use of such open and empty spaces in the city as a proof of concept. The other steps that can be taken include the identification of flood prone streets and localities that have empty plots.

The biggest challenge in execution would be the work on agreements, incentives and terms for use of the empty land.

Buy in from the local community can be garnered by highlighting the myriad uses empty plots can be put to. From serving as community garden spaces to spaces where food waste can be managed sustainably, empty plots perform useful functions besides aiding in flood-management.

Cutting wells across such plots can also help communities access groundwater and serve as a means to recharge ground water during heavy rainfall.

The value of empty plots has been recognized by community gardeners who have developed vacant lots into areas for urban agriculture and as social spaces, especially in wealthier countries. This has helped develop social capacity while simultaneously providing ecosystem services, including stormwater absorption.

Concepts such as “sponge cities” (cities that use blue and green infrastructure to absorb storm water) have gained popularity after successful implementation in China.

In Chennai, the CMDA recently announced OSR’s will be turned into sponge cities and the conversion of empty plots into sponge lands holds promise.

Use of empty plots across the city, mindful of local context, could prove to be a crucial piece of the urban flooding puzzle that Chennai aims to solve.

K.N. Nehru, Minister for Municipal Administration and Water Supply, chaired a meeting on Wednesday to review the impact of monsoon rain on the city since Monday night and the steps taken to mitigate the problem of floods.

Mr. Nehru announced that 15 monitoring officials and zonal officers were on top of the situation in their respective zones. “We have 536 motors but only 156 have been deployed across 65 locations. This is significantly lower than the number of affected areas last year,” he said. The Minister reiterated that pumps would be deployed to clear stagnant water.

He said the patchwork on roads would be taken up only after the civic infrastructure projects were completed to avoid unnecessary digging. The Greater Chennai Corporation has been requested to collaborate with the Public Works Department in establishing 200 monsoon special medical camps across all 200 wards.

All the 19 trees that were uprooted have been cleared by the Corporation. Rainwater was being drained from three subways — Rangarajapuram, Ganesapuram and Manickam Nagar. About 150 relief centres were ready to accommodate people in low-lying areas.

Ma. Subramanian, Minister for Health and Family Welfare, P.K. Sekar Babu, Minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, Gagandeep Singh Bedi, Corporation Commissioner, Mayor Priya Rajan and Deputy Mayor Magesh Kumar were present.

The officials spent the day inspecting various sites such as Otteri, Teachers Guild Colony in Kolathur and Anjaneyar Kovil Street in Pattalam.

Kolathur and Thiruvika Nagar were amongst the worst hit areas in north Chennai on Tuesday morning. The north of the city received the highest quantum of rainfall. “Storm-water drains are completed in Thiruvika Nagar but the stagnation is caused by the excessive rainfall of 35.13 cm that the area has received,” said the Mayor.

Localities around Porur lake may be spared from floods during the ensuing northeast monsoon as the Water Resources Department (WRD) started work on improving the network of channels in and around Porur and Kundrathur on Thursday.

Several areas on the west of Porur lake, including Srinivasapuram, Iyyappanthangal, Mangadu and Paraniputhur, get flooded during the rainy season as the water courses have been urbanised over the years.

The lake’s surplus course running for 1,100 metres would be improved and two regulators installed near the weir to control the water flowing into the surplus course and reduce waterlogging in the neighbouring areas.

It would help plan water release ahead of any heavy inflow and maintain storage in the lake and prevent flooding, said WRD officials.

Of the ₹250 crore provided for flood mitigation work in various parts of the city, nearly ₹100 crore has been allocated for improvements to the network of water channels around Porur lake, which have vanished over the years due to urbanisation.

Minister for MSMEs and Rural Industries T.M. Anbarasan and Kancheepuram Collector M. Aarthi were present during the inauguration of the work.

A 700-metre long channel will be built from Thanthikal channel near Kolathuvancheri Road to Porur surplus course to bridge the gap. The new channel would restore the link that was lost due to urbanisation and encroachments and ensure smooth flow of 200 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of surplus water.

This new channel would prevent sewage from entering the lake. A sluice and one-km channel would be built to carry about 250 cusecs of excess water from Porur lake to Ramapuram lake.

Tenders have been called for the ₹9.70-crore work to construct two box culverts cutting across the NHAI bypass using push through technology. This would help convey about 500 cusecs surplus water to reach Manapakkam channel and drain into the Adyar river, the officials said.

“We are planning to remove encroachments near the lake.

Some areas in the southern suburbs were spared of waterlogging during the recent heavy rain, thanks to the ongoing restoration work at Sembakkam lake.

Spread over 100 acres, the lake faced several challenges, inlcuding encroachments and sewage pollution. It did not have a defined supply channel and surrounding localities were waterlogged whenever the lake filled up.

However, areas such as Chitlapakkam and Sri Sarvamangala Nagar were not warlogged during the recent rain because of the ongoing eco-restoration work. The project is being implemented jointly by the Nature Conservancy India, the Care Earth Trust and IIT-Madras with permission from the Water Resources Department (WRD).

While the flood regulator constructed by the NGOs helped in regulating the surplus water discharge, the channel built by the WRD diverted water from upstream localities such as Selaiyur, Rajakilpakkam and Chitlapakkam to Sembakkam lake.

Moreover, the storage capacity of the waterbody has been increased by 36% because of deepening of the lake and strengthen of the embankment. Efforts are on to prevent flow of sewage into the lake and also to install a wastewater treatment system.

Nisha Priya Mani, project manager-cities, Nature Conservancy India, said nearly 6-7 million litres of sewage is estimated to be flowing into the lake daily. Work would be taken up to treat sewage with constructed wetlands with phragmites species that would act as a biofilter and absorb pollutants in the wastewater flowing into the lake.

The low-cost technology would use sedimentation basins and aeration system to reduce pollutants, improve water quality and restore lake habitat. The level of dissolved oxygen, one of the quality parameters, would be increased from the present 2 mg per litre to 4 mg/l once the work was completed in six months, she said.

The progress of work was discussed periodically with residents. Various challenges, including the impact of the pandemic and the heavy rain last year, figured at a meeting held last week.

M. Ravi, secretary, Sri Sarvamangala Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association, said the eco-restoration work and culverts prevented waterlogging in the area. “We have suggested removal of encroachments behind Thiru.Vi.Ka.

The story so far: In a bid to improve flood preparedness, the Greater Chennai Corporation has dug up 559 roads in many of the 15 zones to develop storm water drains ahead of the onset of the northeast monsoon this year. Roads have been dug up in areas such as Teynampet, Alwarpet, T. Nagar, Kolathur, Kodambakkam, Velachery, Adyar and Pulianthope. Roads in other parts of the city will be dug up for construction of the storm water drains. A total of 93 roads have been dug up under the Singara Chennai 2.0 scheme of the State government, 165 roads have been dug up for laying storm water drains under the flood relief fund, 20 under the infrastructure and amenities fund, 111 under World Bank funds, six under German development bank KfW funds and 162 under Asian Development Bank funds. Following the floods in the previous years, huge sums have been mobilised for flood mitigation. Over 1,033 km of storm water drains have been proposed to be constructed at a cost of ₹4,070 crore in three years.

What are the issues that have cropped up in neighbourhoods as a result?

Water and power supplies and telecom services have been disrupted in some of the areas after the earthmovers damaged the cables and the pipelines. The digging has reportedly weakened the roots of trees on several stretches. The Chennai Corporation has changed the alignment of drains to save trees in many roads. Some residential areas, like Kamdar Nagar in the Teynampet zone, have reported encroachments on old drains. Construction of new drains in a new alignment is also a challenge and the road width is likely to be reduced. Removal of the encroachments on the old drains is also a challenge as encroachers have been protesting.

What are the special instructions for conducting this drive?

In a circular, Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi has ordered the zonal officers to inform TANGEDCO, CMWSSB and BSNL and optical fiber cable operators of their plans in advance. They should ensure the presence of the representatives of the service departments at the site. The contact details of the contractors and the officers should be communicated to the service departments. The officials have been asked to check levels before construction of the drains in each road to prevent water stagnation. The Assistant Engineers, the Assistant Executive Engineers and the Executive Engineers will be held responsible for any flooding after the construction of the new drains. Residents have been requested to dial the Corporation helpline number 1913 to complain about civic issues in the dug-up roads.

Why are some residents sore?

Residents in several neighbourhoods have demanded the construction of storm water drains ahead of the northeast monsoon this year to prevent flooding. But they have demanded that the line agencies coordinate with each other to ensure that the utilities are not damaged. Some residents have reportedly spent money on repairs to the damaged cables and pipelines supplying to their homes. The residents have also demanded that the work be implemented without damaging trees. The digging across the city has also reduced the carriageway of the roads. With the school year beginning, many have reported inconvenience.

Is the flood mitigation project a recent one?

The integrated storm water drain project was initiated during the DMK government of 2006-11 with funding under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission in the core city areas such as Egmore, Chintadripet, Mylapore, Alwarpet, T. Nagar, Adyar and Kodambakkam. During the AIADMK government of 2011-21, many of the drains were constructed with funding from the World Bank in the Cooum and Adyar basins in the old city areas and added areas which were merged in 2011. Later, funds were obtained from KfW and Asian Development Bank for the Kosasthalaiyar basin in north Chennai and the Kovalam basin in south Chennai.

Where is the project headed towards?

The flood mitigation project has been given top priority by the State government. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin appointed a committee, led by retired IAS officer V. Thiruppugazh, for flood mitigation. Mr. Stalin, Chief Secretary V. Irai Anbu and Shiv Das Meena, Secretary, Municipal Administration and Water Supply, have been visiting flooded areas such as Kolathur, Ashok Nagar, Kodambakkam, Pulianthope and T. Nagar to inspect the flood mitigation projects. Mr. Bedi has been reviewing the project every two days to ensure its successful completion. Even as all the flood mitigation projects in all the four river basins — Cooum, Adyar, Kovalam and Kosasthalaiyar — are expected to be completed in three years, the Chennai Corporation has stepped up initiatives to complete major drains that serve as points of drainage into larger waterways ahead of the northeast monsoon this year. Under Singara Chennai 2.0, 60.79 km of storm water drains are being developed in the flooded parts of the city. The Kosasthalaiyar basin areas, such as Tiruvottiyur, Manali, Madhavaram and parts of Ambattur, will get 769 km of drains. The Kovalam basin will get 39 km of drains. The World Bank has funded the development of missing links of drains at 144 locations. The State government has also released a special grant of ₹291.36 crore for flood mitigation covering 107 km of storm water drains.",flood,Chennai Floods 2022,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",November 2021,December 2021,"['Chennai', 'Tamil Nadu', 'India']","['120 mm', '150 mm', '200 mm']","['1000s of houses damaged', '100s of vehicles damaged', '100s of trees uprooted']","['10', '20', '30']","['Major disruption to transportation', 'Power outages', 'Water contamination']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The department has pegged 22 tmcft as the drinking water requirement for Chennai for two years which would mean around 1 tmcft of drinking water every month.

According to water resources department officials, during the heavy rains of 2021 Poondi reservoir had released around 32 tmcft of drinking water but Chennai city could save only 15 to 20 per cent of the water released. In 2020 also around 20 tmcft of water was released from the reservoir but lack of storage facilities is leading to the water being wasted without productive use hence the department is trying to increase the storage facility of Chennai to 22 tmcft so that the drinking water requirements are met.

Residents have started using boats to ferry school children across flooded roads of Iyyappanthangal and Moulivakkam panchayats, both prominent suburbs of the city.

Over 5,000 families in areas such as Dhanalakshmi Nagar, Sai Nagar and Ponniamman Nagar, all of which fall under Kancheepuram district, have complained about persistent flooding of roads after the onset of the northeast monsoon this year.

G. Hariharan, a resident who uses his own boat to ferry school children across inundated areas in Dhanalakshmi Nagar, said many roads had water reaching three feet. His boat could accommodate eight persons at a time.

Residents said the area, which was previously developed as unauthorised layouts, had been regularised by the previous AIADMK regime. Many tanks were filled to develop the layouts. For example, the 1.5-acre Ponniammankoil tank was filled and developed into Ponniamman Nagar.

After the regularisation of unauthorised layouts on payment of a fee to condone the illegal development, flood mitigation infrastructure was delayed for more than five years, leading to various civic issues in the area, residents said.

When phoned for comments, Iyyappanthangal panchayat president Jemila Pandurangan’s husband answered the call and said the government had already sanctioned ₹120 crore for flood mitigation projects in the area. “Work will be completed shortly,” he said.

Many of the flood mitigation projects, including canals, drains and vents, have been taken up in the neighbourhoods. The civic issues caused by faulty construction of the Maduravoyal Bypass in the area have also been identified ahead of the implementation of the ₹120-crore projects, officials said.

The Water Resources Department (WRD) is in the final stages of completing projects, including cut and cover drains, which are worth more than ₹100 crore. “Over 90% of the work has been completed,” a WRD official said.

An official of the Kundrathur block in Kancheepuram district said the water level was expected to reduce after 6 p.m. on Thursday as the district administration had launched a few projects. “We are supplying water in the lorry to residents.

Mayor R. Priya on Thursday announced that a team of the Greater Chennai Corporation will inspect IIT Madras campus to find a solution to the problem of floods in the neighbourhood.

At the Council meeting on Thursday, councillors pointed to the need for preventing the flow of huge volume of water from the sprawling IIT campus to the surrounding residential areas during rain. The councillors requested the civic authorities to develop flood mitigation infrastructure inside the IIT campus.

Residents in the vicinity of large educational institutions have been complaining about their homes getting flooded because of the pumping of water from the campus. During the previous monsoon, residential areas such as Alwarpet, Guindy, Taramani, Velachery, Valasaravakkam, Ambattur and Sholinganallur were flooded because of pumping of water from large educational institutions in the area.

The Corporation has already started work on new drains in some of the areas.

Councillors stressed the need for restoration of temple tanks and sponge parks to mitigate floods in some areas. A few councillors said public consultations should be held in all wards for flood mitigation. They demanded construction of storm-water drains in the western part of East Coast Road.

There was widespread criticism of the effectiveness of the Smart City Projects in Chennai city after the metro witnessed heavy floods in November 2021.

During the last monsoon, the T Nagar area in Chennai, which was developed after huge funds were spent under the Smart City Scheme, was heavily flooded.

Sources in the Tamil Nadu government told IANS that the one-man committee of retired IAS officer P.W.C. Davidar has a detailed and specific analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the Smart City projects implemented in 11 districts of the state under the Smart City mission.

According to officials, the report has explained whether the smart city projects had flaws in its implementation, and has also studied whether all the guidelines of the smart city scheme were followed in a proper and full-proof manner.

Chief Minister M.K. Stalin had come out heavily against the former Municipal administration and water supplies minister, S.P. Velumani after inspecting the flood-affected areas during the 2021 monsoon period. Stalin had then said that no one knew what happened to the funds received under the smart city project.

Tamil Nadu Health Minister, Ma Subramanian while speaking to IANS said, ""Chief Minister will study the report in detail and take action if any irregularities are found.""

The committee was formed in March 2022 after several allegations were made against the implementation of the smart city scheme in Chennai.

92,631,chennai,2022,https://fortune.com/2022/11/08/chennai-india-population-floods-climate-change-adaptation/,8 Nov 2022,"How can cities adapt to climate change? Chennai, India is a new model","Sembakkam Lake, on the outskirts of the Indian city of Chennai, offers a placid view on a recent afternoon, with migratory birds cruising its shores and a small boat with two fishermen bobbing in the center. The calm belies the lake’s pioneering role in a struggle against climate change, and the toll rising sea levels will exact on this rapidly expanding city of 8 million people.

With surrounding communities burgeoning, Sembakkam Lake functions as a catch basin during seasonal monsoons and a reservoir during the long spells without rain in between. The lake helps prevent both flooding and drought, twin perils that afflict Chennai with increasing frequency and severity because of climate change. Just a few years ago, Sembakkam Lake was so overgrown with invasive weeds and clogged with garbage that it made both of those problems worse.

Sembakkam Lake is among hundreds of local water bodies being restored as part of a comprehensive effort to manage two of Chennai’s biggest challenges: a ballooning population and increased vulnerability to floods, drought, tropical storms, and, on occasion, devastating tsunami.

At Sembakkam Lake, The Nature Conservancy and local environmental group Care Earth Trust have stepped to the forefront of that effort. The goal of their collaboration is to transform a degraded lake from weed-choked cesspool to a natural biofilter and catch basin.

“It’s basically climate adaptation,” says Nisha Priya Mani, the Nature Conservancy scientist overseeing the restoration.

Sembakkam Lake is just one battleground in Chennai’s fight against rapid population growth and the intensifying impacts from climate change. The two challenges are linked because often the ravages of climate change inflict the greatest hardship on the poorest and least established residents who make up the biggest source of economic growth.

The population of cities in developing countries is expected to triple by 2050, compared with 13% growth for cities in developed countries, according to the United Nations. By 2050, 5.6 billion people will live in developing world cities, up from 3.2 billion in 2018.

“Two-thirds of the world’s population is expected to be urban, many living in unplanned and informal settlements and in smaller urban centers,” the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in a report issued earlier this year.

Urban centers like Chennai, spread out over a low, flat plain on India’s southeastern Coromandel Coast, can be powerful drivers of economic development. The city’s population, already India’s sixth-largest, is expected to swell by 6-10% annually for at least the next decade. Chennai boasts a growing technology corridor with a factory producing iPhones run by Apple supplier Foxconn; car and truck makers such as Hyundai, Kia and the Indian manufacturer Mahindra; as well as a plethora of technology centers and back offices of other global companies.

Yet often such booming hubs also bear the brunt of climate change. Low-lying coastal locations like Chennai, which has an average elevation of just 22 feet above sea level, are particularly susceptible to rising oceans and more intense cyclones. Many of the developing world’s largest and fast-growing urban centers are situated on or near the equator where temperatures increasingly strain the limits of human habitability given humidity levels, which are also climbing because warmer air absorbs more water.

Climate-related disasters threaten economic dynamism in the developing world just as its cities are grappling with an influx of new residents, thus defeating the reason so many flocked to those cities in the first place—to escape grinding poverty.

Will fast-growing, climate-battered cities of the developing world remain quagmires, multiplying the destructive capacity of climate change? Or can they be transformed into bulwarks of sustainable growth?

Chennai’s historic flood

Chennai’s physical contours—the geographic features that helped make it a megacity even before the British established a trading center here in 1639—can clearly be seen as one descends into Chennai International Airport. Three major rivers—the Adyar, the Cooum and the Kosasthalaiyer—traverse India’s sprawling Eastern Coastal Plains as they flow to the Bay of Bengal from the inland hills. In 1806, the British dug a 500 mile channel—dubbed the Buckingham Canal—that parallels the coast, bisects Chennai, and connects waterways from Kakinada City in the state of Andhra Pradesh to Vilapurram District in the heart of Tamil Nadu, where Chennai is located. The canal was the first of a long series of ambitious interventions in Chennai’s complex hydrology; many of those initiatives changed the city for the worse. More recently, some have changed it for the better.

Over time, as wetlands were filled and rivers rerouted and hemmed in for development, the intricate network of lakes, ponds, streams, and rivers lost its capacity to hold water long enough to recharge underground aquifers before delivering the remaining water smoothly to the sea. It took a historic deluge in 2015 to spur an equally historic response.

In November of that year, record rainfall swamped Chennai’s man-made reservoirs, exceeding what little capacity the concrete and asphalt urban center had to absorb the runoff. Authorities’ decision to open the floodgates to relieve pressure on the reservoirs submerged half the city. In many neighborhoods, the water rose above the ground floors of buildings. By the time flooding subsided days later, more than 400 people had died and some 1.8 million had been forced from their homes.

Chennai authorities had done enough thinking about climate change to understand that disasters like the flood—as well as heat waves, droughts and rising sea levels—would become increasingly common in their city as the planet warms. The flood galvanized an unprecedented effort by city officials to work with environmental and social advocacy groups, businesses and local academic institutions to forge a comprehensive response to the climate challenges ahead, particularly when it came to flooding and drought.

The trick was to “turn the crisis into an opportunity,” said Wilfred Davidar, a former official with the state of Tamil Nadu, who was involved in the city’s response to the flood and the overhaul of its approach to planning afterwards.

Chennai’s coordinated response to climate change

Chennai already had launched its own project to try to address water challenges. The city had signed on a year earlier to an international initiative aimed at building resilience in 100 cities around the world, funded by The Rockefeller Foundation. The Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, now oversees the program with continued Rockefeller funding.

The flood super-charged those efforts. The city and Tamil Nadu state government, joined by a range of outside groups, embarked on an unprecedented, coordinated response. The Rockefeller-funded city resilience program, headed by Krishna Mohan Ramachandran, an energetic Chennai native with a background in corporate communications, helped shape a long-term view that infused government actions with the insights and initiatives of the outside groups that had previously been marginalized or uninvolved—environmentalists, scientists from local universities, companies with social responsibility funds to spend, and community advocates for the poor.

A collection of international development organizations brought billions of dollars and organizational expertise, including the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and international development agencies from the U.S., Germany, and Japan.

Relocating vulnerable populations

Some of the city’s first steps to handle the flooding underscored the drawbacks of established methods for dealing with natural disasters when applied to the chronic challenge of climate change. Authorities leaned into a plan to relocate large but informal communities that had established themselves along the banks of rivers. These enclaves housed tens of thousands of families—some occupying formal, concrete dwellings, others living in more ramshackle shanties. Nearly all were poor. In total, almost 100,000 have been moved about 20 kilometers from the city center to a marshy stretch of field where they now live in more than a dozen high-rise tenements.

The relocations and the city’s water body restorations have helped prevent a repeat of the massive flooding and acute water shortages for the city center so far. Yet displaced residents and advocacy groups say the relocations haven’t done enough to prepare low-income communities to cope with climate change. In some ways, flood prevention programs have left poor residents worse off.

The informal settlers had adapted to living along the rivers, in many cases building mutually beneficial arrangements with the city’s wealthiest communities adjacent to them. They found work as household help or gardeners. Men drove auto rickshaws, ferrying the wealthier residents who lived nearby. Others survived on odd jobs like sharpening knives from a roaming bicycle set-up or recycling trash. Their children could attend local public schools and there were government health clinics nearby.

When the floodwaters came, usually several times a year, informal residents decamped to the upper floors of nearby community centers or the apartments of extended family. When the waters receded, they would return and clean up.

In their new high-rise tenements in Parumbakkam, the inland area where they have been relocated, there is less work and fewer facilities to provide education and health care.

“Eighty to 90% of the residents are casual laborers. We cannot guarantee social mobility just by providing housing,” says Vanessa Peter, a researcher and advocate for poor communities in the city. “They are being stigmatized and criminalized for the flooding in the city.”

At a day care center after hours, block leaders, elected community representatives for up to 100 families, do their best to resolve complaints and mobilize the bureaucracy to fix buildings, pick up trash, improve safety and address persistent flooding in the area. The flooding—expected, since the projects were built on marshlands—is an irony many residents are quick to note.

Mohana, a 36-year-old mother of two, tells the group how she got the tenement managers to clean a despoiled water tank. It’s a small win after six years in the building. She relishes it.

“It took a week to get it to happen,” she reports to the group.

More resilient climate change adaptations

Now pressure is growing to swing the pendulum away from displacing communities along the city’s waterways to development that seeks to make them more resilient to the consequences of climate change. At Sembakkam Lake, for example, The Nature Conservancy is building a facility that uses an aerated lagoon and reed beds to filter waste and sewage before it enters the lake from surrounding communities. It has teamed up with a local branch of the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology and IBM to monitor water quality directly and using satellite photos.

Recreational fishermen have returned to Sembakkam Lake amid its restoration. The rehab project is reviving some native species and providing a place for rain to gather, recharging the area’s underground aquifers. Bill Spindle

The project has added 100,000 cubic meters of volume to the lake, one-third more than it held before, according to Priya Mani.

“Cities now have these stacked or reverberating effects, where you’ve got all kinds of things happening at once. That sometimes also creates opportunities for kinds of stacked solutions that solve more than one thing at a time,” says Minal Pathak, a professor at Ahmedabad University who is part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment of impacts on urban areas. “We can give a whole list of solutions that don’t cost that much money, that can address climate change and that can bring development benefits. And we need those now.”

Other actors are pushing to redevelop communities along the city’s waterways in ways that don’t require massive relocations. The Sponge Collaborative is an architecture and urban planning firm founded by a trio of U.S.-trained Indians to promote nature-based solutions across India. They call themselves a “resiliency planning” firm. In Chennai, where the partnership is based, one of its first projects has been promoting nature-based ideas for restoring the Buckingham Canal that foster healthy population growth while both controlling flooding and retaining water for community use.

One such idea is multi-storied housing with terraced park and recreation land along river banks that accommodates rising water and allows some of it to be absorbed underground before the rest returns to the river and flows out to the nearby sea.

“Climate change poses an opportunity, despite its negative impacts,” says Praveen Raj, a Harvard and California Berkeley trained founder of the Sponge Collaborative. “It allows us to take a new look at things.”",,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, India",November 2015,December 2015,Chennai,Record rainfall,"400+ deaths, 1.8 million people displaced",,Floodwaters submerged half the city,"Chennai has launched a comprehensive effort to manage two of its biggest challenges: a ballooning population and increased vulnerability to floods, drought, tropical storms, and, on occasion, devastating tsunami.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) Mayor, R. Priya, the first Dalit woman Mayor of Chennai, in the Rs 789 crore deficit budget for the financial year 2022-23 has given a major thrust on stormwater drains in the budget as the 2021 floods had led to the city being inundated in water.

In 2021, the floods in Chennai led to five people losing their lives and many becoming homeless.

The Madras High Court had come down heavily on the state government and the Greater Chennai Corporation for their ""unpreparedness"" to tackle the sudden and unexpected heavy rains. The court had observed, ""For half the year we are made to cry for water, and the other half we are made to die in it.""

These observations of the court had drawn flak from environmentalists and the Opposition.

The GCC has now decided to earmark a ""good"" sum in its 2022-23 budget for stormwater drains to bring a solution to the floods that inundate the city during unexpected heavy rains.

The stormwater drain was given the highest allocation for Rs 1,235 crore under different schemes in a budget with estimated revenue receipts of Rs 2824.77 and revenue expenditure of Rs 3,613.35 crores.

Advertisement In the budget, Rs 424 crores are allocated for tackling solid waste management and Rs 221.3 crores for the construction of bridges to clear the city of traffic woes.

In her maiden budget speech, the Mayor said that the corporation would get Rs 3.5 crore for three dialysis units, which will be increased to one centre per zone.

Further, the corporation will establish three new homeless shelters at Rs 2.4 crores, she added.

Street signs will be digitalised, and Rs 8.43 crores has been allocated for the project.

Meanwhile, 1000 bus shelters will be constructed or renovated under the Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) model to generate an advertisement revenue of Rs 52.26 crores.

Manali Lake, Sathangadu Lake, Sadayinkuppam Lake are to be maintained at the cost of Rs 143 crore, announced the Mayor.

But now, it is synonymous with another Chennai image: Roads that turn into rivers, boats for vehicles, and people stranded in homes at the first hint of heavy rainfall.

When Chennai received over 900mm excess rainfall in November, the roads of T Nagar, and indeed other parts of Chennai, were completely submerged. It was the second highest rainfall recorded in the city in November since 2015, when it suffered massive floods.

In November 2015, Chennai received 1,049mm of rain, compared with 915mm of rainfall till November 29 this year. There have been particularly heavy rains between November 6 and 7 (210 mm), November 10 (22mm), November 19 (32mm), and November 26 (29mm). Overall, Tamil Nadu and the neighbouring Union territory of Puducherry together received 630mm of rainfall from October 1to November 29 as against the average for these months of 350mm. “During the same time period the rainfall received in Chennai is 1,130mm, which is 83% higher than the average,” said V Puviarasan, deputy director of the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Chennai.

Across the state, 72 people were killed in rain-related incidents, 15,164 people were evacuated from low-lying areas and accommodated in 182 relief camps, and crops spread over 50,000 hectares were damaged.

Low flood limit

In the 2015 tragedy, more than 400 people lost their lives across the state. The situation was compounded when water from the Chembarambakkam lake was released, flooding Chennai. Since then, the Tamil Nadu government has said that a ₹5,000 crore integrated stormwater project is being implemented, and in T Nagar alone, ₹9.3 crore has been spent on a drain under the “smart city” mission, and was completed in 2020.

This expenditure includes work to construct collector, feeder and arterial drains, canals for the Adyar and Cooum basins, which were completed last year, and ongoing work for canals for the Kosasthalaiyar basin in northern Chennai and Kovalam in the south. And yet, Chennai floods.

The first reason is Chennai’s long history of vanishing lakes and water bodies, captured by rampant and unfettered urbanisation. Only 15% of Chennai’s wetlands are left, according to a study by Chennai-based Care Earth Trust, a biodiversity research organisation. Their findings show that Chennai’s built-up area grew from 47 sq. km in 1980 to 402 sq. km in 2012, while wetlands declined from 186 sq. km to 71 sq. km.

Between 2017 and 2018, about 48km of drains were built under the smart cities mission. Wherever these new drains have been laid, there was little to no flooding, said an official of Greater Chennai Corporation. “Places like T Nagar flood all the time mostly because there are old drains, which we are looking to reconstruct,” he said, requesting anonymity.

In T Nagar, particularly, there was another problem. Contractors engaged in improvement work for the Mambalam canal, where all the water from T Nagar drains, had dumped debris all along a length of 1.7km that blocked inlets.

An indication that the drains in the city failed to work during this monsoon comes from the overburdening of another department, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, which manages the city’s water supply and sewage network.

“We usually pump out 585 mld (million litres per daily) of sewage everyday, which reaches the treatment plants, but since heavy rains began, we are pumping out 920 mld,” an official from the department said, but declined to be named. “The additional load is because the corporation is using heavy motors to drain rainwater from waterlogged streets into the sewerage pipes.”

“We also stop our system for about four to five hours every night for maintenance,” he said. “But this entire month, the pumping system and treatment plants have been functioning 24x7.”

According to municipality records, there are more than 30,000 interior roads and 471 bus route roads in Chennai that add up to close to 5,000km and 300km, respectively, but the city’s drainage network is present in just around 2,000km. Many of these drains were built at least three decades ago.

“The old drains were constructed for a rainfall capacity of 20mm per hour, whereas the new drains are being built for 70mm per hour. The old drains are built of brick and mortar so they are dilapidated and break easily,” said the municipality official cited above said.

“They don’t have the capacity to withstand the kind of rains we have received this year,” he said. “We have been using reinforced concrete for the new drains since 2015.”

Many areas in the city were flooded although they had roads with drains on both sides, found a field audit by Chennai-based Arappor Iyakkam, an anti-corruption NGO.

“Why are they spending crores of money to build these drains which aren’t working? They may as well spend less to buy pumps to drain water via sewage pipes, which is what they have been doing every monsoon,” said Jayaram Venkatesan, convener of Arappor Iyakkam.

Corruption in awarding tenders as well as improper design where the drain slope is higher than the height of the road or the gradient not matching the water body to which it is linked are primary problems, Venkatesan said.

After years of demands by activists and environmentalists, the municipal corporation his week began releasing maps on its website on where drains are located, a crucial information gap till now. “Only with these maps will we be able to understand where the drains are present, how they are connected and in which direction they drain,” said Venkatesan.

These maps show, for instance, a ward in T Nagar where the height of a manhole on the street is at 5m but the drain is at a height of 5.7m, impeding the flow of water, said Raj Bhagat, senior manager of Geoanalytics at research organisation World Resources Institute India, who is studying these maps.

There has also been no way of verifying if these drains have been designed in tune with the rate of rainfall, he said. “Even if the drain is designed for a particular rainfall rate, it is connected to another drain so the second drain has to have more capacity as well because it accumulates water from both streets,” Bhagat said.

The city’s drainage network is designed only to carry average rainfall, and that it cannot handle excess rainfall, according to KP Subramanian, former professor of urban engineering at Chennai’s Anna University. “And it gets clogged further with solid waste and drain slits that are not cleaned regularly.”

There is also a clear lack of coordination between various civic departments ranging from the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, which approves building constructions, the public works department that is in charge of de-silting water bodies, the municipal corporation which builds drains and Metro Water that lays pipelines under roads for water and sewage connections.

“We have a common problem where the corporation lays a new bitumen road and almost immediately it is dug up by other state agencies such as the Metro Water, electricity board, telephone and internet providers to lay utility cables underground,” a government official said on condition of anonymity. “Similarly, in some places, Metro Water pipelines run perpendicular to the drains underground, which reduces the capacity of the drains.”

Moving forward

Based on the November rains, municipal authorities have identified pockets where drainage capacity has to be augmented, said GCC commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi, who took over the civic body in May.

He also said drain construction will now follow prescribed standards. “The World Bank’s standard, for example, is for bigger drains to take 70mm of rainfall per hour. But if we receive 100mm rainfall and that has to be taken care of, the stormwater drains will be bigger and the roads will become smaller,” Bedi said. “Drains are constructed for optimum rainfall and not heavy rainfall because there has to be a balance between the road width and the drain.”

Given this tenuous balance, Bedi said the corporation was looking at ways to bolster drainage even if there is stagnant water, like permanent pumps. “We are looking at how fast we can drain out the water even if it stagnates. As the city expands, many drains’ capacity has to be increased. And it’s not just the case in Chennai. It is the same for Bengaluru or Mumbai,” he said.

Another peculiar issue that GCC engineers identified during these rains were so-called saucer-type streets, where the constant relaying of roads resulted in them being at a higher level than homes in densely populated areas. “You can’t put up drains in these places so we have decided to have permanent pumps there too,” said Bedi.

Ironically, another conundrum that the city faces is a drought-like situation a few months after the northeast monsoon, which experts say can be addressed if the urban run-off is stored. Water from drains should be diverted to existing water bodies, particularly those located outside Chennai, which will help in mitigating flooding as well as recharging aquifers, experts said.

“We thought they would learn lessons from the 2015 floods, but they haven’t,” said Sekhar Raghavan, director of the city based Rain Centre, a non-profit. “You cannot build a stormwater drain over a lake or a pond and let that water go into the sea. Drains work only in specific locations.”

“The government needs to look into the potential of water bodies, protect, reclaim and rejuvenate them,” Raghavan said. “This will rescue flooding and, if these water bodies can be made into recharge ponds and reservoirs, the local community can use it for their water needs.”

All said, the city will continue to flood, former corporation officials said. “It’s a complex issue. One, we have geographical disadvantages of being a flat city close to sea level. And since for more than 70 years, we have encroached on all the natural water bodies,” a former official said, asking not to be named. “It’s a collective failure of officials, real estate and civil society.”

The issue of the release of water from the Chembarambakkam reservoir in December 2015 that led to the historic flooding in Chennai resurfaced in Tamil Nadu Assembly on Monday with State Finance Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan alleging that ""a break and interjection"" in contacting the then chief minister Jayalalithaa resulted in the disaster.

Recalling a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), Mr. Rajan said Tamil Nadu State Disaster Management Committee had not met even once in three years until 2015.

""The government was not able to evolve regulations,"" he said while responding to former chief minister Edappadi K. Palniswami's argument that 60 cm rain in a single day was responsible for the 2015 flooding.

“I will bring the report and record of the same in the House. Let the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition clarify the issue after that,” Mr. Rajan further said, pointing out that even that report was not placed for two years on the ground of seeking clarification from the Accountant General.

Mr. Rajan also said he could see “excess of democracy” in the Assembly, and he was happy about the development.

“When I was a member of the opposition, those who were in power did not give us an opportunity to express our views,” he said, referring to the permission given by Speaker P. Appavu to All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) members.

Mr. Palaniswami, however, said when water bodies were full during the rainy season, local officials could decide on the release of water as there was no need to get permission from anyone.

“Permission is required only to release water for irrigation,” he said responding to Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) member A.P. Nandakumar who alleged that the delay in reaching the then CM was responsible for the flooding.

Mr. Palaniswami had said two days ago that the rain in Chennai caused the traffic jam. “In 2015, Chennai received 60 cm rain in a day and excess water from over 100 water bodies also flowed into Chembarambakkam,” he pointed out.",issue,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city and suburbs,60 cm in a day,"Rs. 10,000 crore",464,1.8 million people were displaced,The floods were caused by the release of water from the Chembarambakkam reservoir without prior warning.

Water stagnation continues in several parts of the city even four days after the downpour halted. The inundation in the city and its outskirts sparked off a debate about who is to be held responsible for the present circumstances. Questions of a permanent solution are also being raised.

With all fingers pointing to the state governments and Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) for the dismal state of affairs, the incident sparked mudslinging between the two Dravidian parties which have been ruling the state for decades.

Over the last 15 years, a sum of Rs 16,000 crore has been spent on stormwater drains and related infrastructure, but nothing has changed to save the city and its residents from inundation.

While experts point out to lack of planning in the stormwater drain construction and encroachments across water bodies, anti-corruption organisations point finger at corrupt practices adding to the woes of Chennai residents.

LOSS OF WATER BODIES

The city of Chennai was once known for its numerous water bodies from the north to the south. The three urban rivers, Kosasthalaiyar in the north, Cooum in the centre and Adayar in the south play a crucial role in carrying rainwater. The Buckingham canal across the city runs parallel to the coast and connects the rivers. The city also had major and minor canals along with hundreds of water bodies.

But, given the fast growth witnessed in the city, the water bodies are encroached and polluted.

""We have not learned anything even after the massive, devastating floods in 2015. Despite several studies and reports to the government, nothing much has changed after six years,"" said Jayaram Venkatesan of the Arappor Iyakkam, an anti-corruption organisation.

""Apart from the rivers and canals, the city has hundreds of water bodies to store the water and can act as natural rainwater harvesting systems. Unfortunately, the efforts taken to restore the water bodies and the very understanding of the importance of such units is extremely poor,"" he said.

G Sundarrajan of Poovulagin Nanbargal believed that Chennai has lost its natural drainage system due to rapid urbanisation. ""We should not hide behind climate change for poor drainage systems. After 2015, all our drainage systems were supposed to be redesigned to carry 10 centimetres of rainfall in a couple of hours. The previous government claimed to have spent Rs 6,770 crores for flood mitigation, but we don't see any change on the ground,” he said.

WHO ARE THE ENCROACHERS?

Several studies have found the water bodies across the city have shrunk in size due to encroachments. The long list of encroachers includes different departments of the state government, making the government a perpetual defaulter.

""The state government itself has constructed public offices by encroaching the water bodies. For example, after the 39-acre Villivakkam lake was restored, only 15 acres were used for storage. The government has planned a sewage treatment plant and a theme park on 24 acres,"" accused Jayaram.

The big houses and companies easily escape the process of being evicted from water body encroachments, but the eviction of the poor has been a regular affair.

""Even while resettling the slum dwellers, the government resorts to constructing settlements in water bodies. Semmancheri is a classic example of such violations. We have filed a case to remove the police station constructed in the water body as well,"" said Jayaram.

The power vested on local bodies to reclassify the lands has been challenged to prevent such water bodies from being used for construction purposes.

Allegations of debris being dumped in the Mambalam canal, leading to the Adayar river was cited as the reason for increased flooding in parts of the city. The Arappor Iyakkam accused the GCC of failing to monitor such violations leading to hardships for the people.

The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) has been accused of approving plans and residential apartments in water bodies. ""Irrigation tanks do not flood during rains. They fill up. If you build your home inside a lake, your home will fill up - not flood. Water doesn't care for CMDA approvals,"" tweeted environmental activist Nityanand Jayaraman.

Velacheri is one among the several reservoirs whose area has shrunk owing to urbanisation.

ARE THE STORMWATER DRAINS WORKING?

The recent rains once again brought the city to a standstill. The claims of the present DMK government and the previous AIADMK regime on having found a solution for water stagnation problems soon turned out to be hollow.

Janakarajan, a retired professor from Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) pointed out the faulty design of the stormwater drains in the last decade.

""The drains should be scientifically designed to carry water. I doubt if there were any elevation and gravity surveys done before construction. Poor maintenance of the drains also played a role in inundating the city,"" he said.

The social audits conducted by the Arappor Iyakkam confirmed such technical glitches in designs, Jayaram claimed. ""There are drains across the city, but they were not draining the rainwater, but stagnated the water. There are a lot of missing interconnections to carry the water to the storage bodies and issues of gradients were clearly visible"" he said.

Janakarajan also cited the increasing population and decreasing urban space as another reason for the issues faced by the city.

""The population density in Chennai has increased to 34,000 from 26,000 per square kilometre in 2011. The per capita drainage space has reduced as a result of increasing population density and infrastructural development. A total restructuring of the drainage system is the only solution,” he insisted.

The GCC engaged heavy motor pumps to drain the water from the drains, clearly exposing the lapses in the drainage system being insufficient to save the city from inundation.

WAS THE GOVT PREPARED BEFORE THE MONSOON?

Just before the North-East Monsoon (NEM) set in, the DMK government claimed to have de-silted the stormwater drains. But, when the situation of inundation worsened, it blamed the previous regime for the situation.

The chief minister accused the previous AIADMK regime of indulging in corruption in constructing the stormwater drains and announced an enquiry committee to study the problems pertaining. The AIADMK leaders, in turn, accused the DMK government of being under-prepared for the NEM.

""In parts of the city, the rainwater was drained through the sewer pipes and not through the drains, which clearly indicates the failure of the infrastructure. The GCC and Chennai metro water authority usually allege each other for the issue, exposing the lack of coordination,” said Jayaram.

He also claimed that in a recent tender floated for Rs 120 crores by GCC, Rs 30 crores was allocated for constructing missing links while Rs 90 crores have been earmarked for destroying and reconstructing existing drains.

The capacity of the major storage tanks around the city has also reduced for want of the de-silting process.

Every rainy season, Chennai is flooded. Some of its streets get inundated even after a single spell. The maps show that as the need for residential units grew, houses were built in low-lying areas and floodplains, leading to stagnation. The loss of a portion of the Pallikaranai marshland added to the crisis. Moreover, many missing links of stormwater drains, even along major roads, led to frequent stagnation.

Flat terrain

image/svg+xml

Chennai lies in a relatively flatter terrain and is close to sea level in most places. Some localities are in relatively low-lying areas, so the water doesn't get drained quickly, leading to flooded streets

Land of lakes

image/svg+xml

Before the rampant increase in residential units began, bunds were constructed to store water and irrigate farms, forming thousands of lakes in and around the city, as shown on the map. However, once the farms were sold, the lakes lost their original purpose. The smaller drains that fed these lakes got closed.

Such drains are crucial during floods as they aid the excess flow of water. Also, these lakes can be used as flood buffer and to temporarily store and clean sewage. However, they are not being repurposed for such uses

Rampant urbanisation

The map shows the built-up area of Chennai and its immediate surroundings by 1990 , by 2000 , by 2010 , and by 2015. It can be observed that until 1990, the built-up area mostly stayed clear of water bodies and rivers. However, the later constructions came up increasingly closer to waterbodies and in low-lying areas, leading to stagnation after a rainy spell.

Near the river

image/svg+xml 2007 2020

One of the major issues plaguing the city is the failure to protect the floodplains of major rivers from urbanisation. The maps below show the built-up area around a portion of the Adyar in 2007 and 2020. Many residential, commercial and industrial places have mushroomed in the period, which is a cause for concern. Due to the rampant urbanisation, the river's flood-carrying capacity has also been reduced in recent times

Repeated flooding in Adyar

The places marked blue in the map recorded inundation during the 2020 rainfall. The sites near the river get flooded repeatedly every year. This year too, houses located close to the Adyar were among the worst affected

Building on marshland

The Pallikaranai marshland has shrunk in size in recent years due to urbanisation. The satellite photo on the left is from 1990, and the one on the right is from 2018. Many of the major constructions in the marshland are government buildings, apart from residential and commercial sites. Wetlands act as a sponge during a flood. They will trap the excess water and will slowly release it back. Especially in an urban area, such regions are valuable as their massive holding capacity will naturally provide flood control

MISSING LINKS

Lack of stormwater drains

In a study published by the Greater Chennai Corporation in January 2021, covering select zones, it was estimated that about 45 km of stormwater drains missing from the GCC area. Of the 45 km, some links were missing and had to be constructed anew, and the rest had to be demolished and reconstructed . In some parts a mix of both was required. The first graph shows the missing links (in metres) in the zones surveyed

At least four people have died in the city after rainwater inundated large parts of the residential areas and commercial hubs late last week. Schools and colleges were closed and railway traffic disrupted. Though the low pressure formation in the Bay of Bengal, which caused the heavy downpour, has lost its severity, there is fear that the city may see floods of the scale it experienced in 2015, when over 400 people died as record rain fell during the wettest November in a century.

As in 2015, an extreme weather event is blamed for the flooding — more heavy rainfall is predicted. Climate experts have warned that such extreme weather events are likely to be frequent in the coming years. The solution lies in preparedness to face storms, floods, sea ingress. Cities like Chennai also face extreme water stress in summer months. Since the 2015 rain in Chennai, the impact of which was exacerbated due to poor reservoir management, the administration has done extensive work to build storm water drains in flood-prone areas and declogged the city’s two rivers, Adyar and Cooum. But much more has to be done, especially since the root cause of the city’s distress during rains lies in mismanagement of its water bodies. The unplanned growth of the city has led to the filling up of lakes and tanks and shrunk wetlands. For instance, the shopping hub of T Nagar was built on a lake bed and the city airport came up on the floodplains of Adyar. Similarly, the city has expanded in the south to encroach on a large wetland, Pallikaranai, where residential colonies, institutional areas and even a large garbage dump have been built. A mass rapid transport system has severely restricted the flow in Buckingham Canal, which was designed also as a protective barrier against floods and sea ingress. Over 300 lakes, tanks and canals have disappeared in the past decades and, according to the administration, over 1.5 lakh illegal constructions choke the cityscape. This is the story of most Indian cities that have been callous about precious natural assets such as rivers, streams and lakes, which were the primary reason for the evolution of these habitations as urban centres.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Another spell of heavy rain, the met department said, could be expected. Flooding was imminent. For the second time in ten days, Chennai had to take cover from the rain above and flood waters all around.

The fury of the Chennai rains were felt the greatest in T-Nagar. For most of last week, heavily flooded roads and waterlogged underpasses brought Chennai’s commercial hub to a grinding halt. The irony: barely two years ago, the Greater Chennai Corporation spent the last of Rs 200 on giving T-Nagar a facelift, as it was earmarked as a smart city.

It didn’t take more than one spell of heavy rain to give this locality a reality check. The civic authority now admits that course correction is on the cards.

‘Storm-water drains need more augmentation’

“The existing storm water drain infrastructure, as we have seen, requires more augmentation,” said Gagandeep Singh Bedi, Commissioner, Greater Chennai Corporation, “I would not like to comment on what has been done in the past by predecessors. But what I’d like to say is: we plan to augment the existing storm-water drain infrastructure.”

Bedi’s comments come just days after Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin laid the blame on the AIADMK Government for not maintaining storm-water drainage in Chennai , which he said, led to the widespread flooding. The issue, after all, wasn’t restricted to T-Nagar alone. For days, several old-city neighbourhoods like West Mambalam, Kodambakkam bore the brunt of the deluge. Homes were flooded, with ground-level apartments and car parks going under.

In West Mambalam’s Vidya Shree Apartments, the residents’ welfare association managed to secure a water pump when heavy rains first hit on November 8. They spent the next few days pumping water out of their apartment — it rose to two feet before the pumping began, nearly damaging parked cars on the property.

“Since 7am yesterday, we have been continuously pumping water out,” said Shiva, a resident of the apartment complex, who we met on November 8. “We have been successful at pumping out almost 40 to 50 percent of the water,” he added, “Our house is built about three feet below the road level. So, water keeps stagnating when there is a heavy flood.”

Today, environmental and social activists have begun calling out city planners for their short-sightedness. The issue, they say, isn’t to do with building better storm-water drains, but to crack down on unchecked development on environmentally sensitive water bodies naturally tasked with draining the city off rainwater.

“Storm-water drains do not drain water into the sea — that’s the job of natural drains,” points out Nityanand Jayaraman, a well-known social and environmental activist, “When you have limited natural drains choked by development, building storm-water drains which will convey even more water that they can handle, and in turn mean you’re shifting the problem of flooding from one place to another.”

‘Stop construction on tidal water bodies’

Several fingers now point to unchecked industrial development along the environmentally sensitive Ennore Creek as a ticking time bomb. The creek, which fills up during heavy monsoonal showers is home to massive industrial developments like the NTPC thermal plant, HPCL and BPCL oil terminals to name a few.

These permissions, activists claim, have been granted owing to the creek being seen as a barren wasteland during non-monsoon months.

“Tidal water bodies and seasonal water bodies appear to be dry and useless for several months in a year. Even in that time it is being used by invisible people like grazers and fishers — people who don’t matter to our economy because they fall outside of capitalism,” Jayaraman adds, “And so these areas are then looked at as wastelands.”

He continues: “The only way we know to inject value is to allow modern capital to play, and modern capital plays by building. Our capitalist economy values built spaces, not open un-built spaces. For our resilience to natural shocks, open and un-built spaces are a must.”

On the other side of Chennai, recently developed neighbourhoods like Perumbakkam also saw flooding thanks to approvals being granted for residential development on low-lying catchment areas. In fact several hundreds of homes in Perumbakkam have been built in close proximity to the Perumbakkam Lake, in what was once a large, natural water basin.

‘Flooding in areas we never had flooding before,’ admits Chennai Corporation

Yet, the corporation is firm in its view that flooding in these parts occurred because their infrastructure simply wasn’t good enough.

“The city is expanding and the new areas are under strain because they don’t have the infrastructure that’s there in the older parts of the city,” says Bedi, “So, the new areas are prone to flooding if the infrastructure in terms of roads, culverts and storm-water drains are not appropriate.”

What then of the many old-city neighbourhoods that also saw flooding? “Even in existing areas, once the density of buildings and concreting of roads and pathways increases, coupled with encroachments, blocks the storm-water drain network, it leads to new challenges,” Bedi admits.

“This leads to flooding even in areas where we have never had flooding, before,” adds the commissioner, “In some parts of the city, new constructions led to stagnation and the corporation had to struggle.”

The admission is significant. What the Greater Chennai Corporation is admitting to is that rapid urbanization is indeed making Chennai a lot more flood prone, and this is not only in the case of newer townships and neighbourhoods.

The corporation has taken it upon itself to build walls around riverbeds and lakes so as to prevent encroachments. However, whether the civic authority will clamp down on approvals granted to developments in and around low-lying catchment areas like the Ennore Creek or Perumbakam Lake is yet to be seen.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

With 1,000 mm of rainfall in just four weeks, these were the worst rains since the devastating floods of 2015 when it poured for 22 out of 30 days in December, setting a record of 1,049 mm.

Then, as now, the flooding in Chennai was described as a man-made disaster, despite occurring during a storm called Cyclone Nivar. On both occasions, death, disruption and destruction was the result. India has faced more than 300 weather events in the last two decades, resulting in over 79,000 deaths.

Tamil Nadu has long been known for its susceptibility to a long list of natural disasters: cyclones, storm surges, coastal flooding, torrential rainfall, earthquakes and tsunamis. India accounts for 24% of all disasters in Asia and Chennai ranks seventh in the list of India’s most vulnerable districts to extreme flooding and cyclones.

The southern state’s 1,076 km of coastline makes up more than 13% of the total Indian coastline, bordered by the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Indian Ocean in the south and the Arabian Sea in the west.

Cyclones need a lot of heat (at least 26 degrees Celsius) to form, and warm tropical sea beds provide this energy. The Bay of Bengal has a deep layer of warm water, which fuels the rapid formation of cyclones that gather force within a short period of time.

Since the catastrophic 2004 Boxing Day tsunami that killed 10,000 people in Tamil Nadu, there have been 14 cyclones and regular flooding in this area. Yet the preparation and response to these extreme events have been woefully inadequate over the last 15 years.

Nothing has changed

The India Meteorological Department issued a red alert warning on November 12. But 48 hours later, Chennai had once again ground to a standstill due to heavy rainfall triggered by the northeast monsoon season which occurs between October-December annually.

Seventeen deaths were recorded, and power outages, submerged dams and underpasses hampered movement around the city, including rescue operations by the National Disaster Risk Force.

As Tamil Nadu’s tech-hub “smart city”, Chennai has attracted newcomers with the prospect of good jobs, housing and amenities, swelling its population to just over 1.1 crore people. This has put even more pressure on existing infrastructure and services.

Play

Despite the continuous development and increasing population, nothing in the city’s disaster response has changed over the last 16 years, even after the devastating 2015 floods. Officials failed to take preventive measures and released dam water without announcement, over-filling the Chembarambakkam reservoir flooding the nearby areas. The city’s densely packed housing has only made preparation for any future extreme weather events more difficult.

Gridlocked systems

Most of Chennai’s problems revolve around inadequate and poorly managed infrastructure, resulting in leaks, blocked drains and over-burdened sewage systems – problems that have existed in Chennai for decades. Bad planning is also an issue in the city, where the state government has allowed building and development on marshlands and wetlands which would normally have soaked up floodwater.

The Cooum, which flows through the city, has slowly become a highly polluted, toxic river full of sewage. During the 2015 Chennai floods, it quickly became an open sewer as the city’s drains overflowed and the water submerged sewage systems.

One of the greatest problems the city faces is plastic pollution. Around 34 lakh tonnes of plastic waste are generated by India each year. Chennai ranks second in the country for plastic waste, producing 429 tonnes a day. The plastic clogs up drains and sewers so that during heavy rainfall floodwater has nowhere to go, resulting in waterlogged streets.

Failure of policies and inadequate infrastructure coupled with excessive bureaucracy and inaction mean that every time there are heavy rains or storms, Chennai’s citizens face disruption, displacement and tragedy as they did in November. It is essential that the city significantly reduces its plastic pollution, invests in proper floodwater drainage and continually re-assesses the changing risks and vulnerabilities to future flood scenarios.

Making the right decisions and implementing them may not be a straightforward process in a country like India because of widespread poverty, lack of planning, coordination and proper channelling of funding. Perhaps cities like Chennai need to adopt alternative approaches such as community-based flood management programmes.

This would encourage communities to take responsibility and action, empowering the very people whom the flooding affects most. It would also help to dispel the dangerous sense of inevitability that pervades the city about flooding.

There are specific reasons Chennai floods so easily, but they can be addressed. Awareness of how plastic pollution contributes to the problem and what can be done about it at a local level would be a good place to start.

Government officials report that 4 people have died in rain-related incidents in the state. Further severe weather is forecast for the region.

Observers described the rainfall as some of the heaviest since the the 2015 floods when more than 250 people lost their lives. In 24 hours to 07 November 2021, the neighbourhood of Nungambakkam in Chennai recorded 215 mm of rain. During the next 24 hour period, Perambur in Chennai saw 140mm, while areas of Chengalpattu and Tiruvallur districts recorded over 130 mm.

Rivers are swollen and authorities have opened the flood gates of some dams and reservoirs. According to India’s Central Water Commission (CWC), the Cauvery, Thambraparni, Ponnaiyar, Kodaiyar, Paralayar and Ayyar rivers are all above normal levels. CWC also reported several reservoirs or barrages were receiving higher inflow than the threshold limit including the Bhavanisagar Reservoir, Grand Anicut, Mettur Reservoir, Upper Anicut and the Vaigai Reservoir.

In Chennai, roads and railways lines were flooded in the city, disrupting traffic and train services. Some flight operations were also affected. Chief Minister MK Stalin waded through flood water as he visited some of the affected areas.

News agency PTI, quoting Tamil Nadu’s revenue and disaster management minister KKSSR Ramachandran, said that 4 people have died in rain-related incidents in the state. One person has been injured and hundreds displaced from their homes. Dozens of relief camps have been set up to house those who need emergency accommodation. Four teams from India’s National Disaster Response Force have been deployed to affected areas of Thiruvallur, Chengalpattu and Madurai.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned the recent formation of an area of low pressure is likely to bring a fresh spell of heavy to very heavy rainfall with isolated extremely heavy rainfall likely over Tamil Nadu and south Coastal Andhra Pradesh from 09 to 11 November.

The weather conditions for Tamil Nadu, especially for Chennai, have been rough ever since the onset of Northeast Monsoons. Although not half as bad as the 2015 flood situation, the city has already witnessed the loss of lives and heavy damages to properties.

Now, yet another low-pressure system has threatened a fresh spell of heavy raisin over Chennai. As the city remains under an orange alert on Wednesday and Thursday, here’s a quick look back at the flooding episode last week.

Between November 6 to 11, as many as 14 people lost their lives due to heavy rains. On November 11, the overnight downpour led to waterlogging of 13 subways while uprooting over 260 trees. As a result, schools and colleges had to remain shut for a day.

As part of the damage control, local authorities were seen working to drain the flooded areas, while the army and the NDRF were called in to assist rescue efforts. As per reports, food packets were distributed to nearly 20 lakh people.

Advertisement After the flood situation subsided, the Chennai police deployed unmanned hovercrafts to assess the flood-affected areas.

This week, although the rains aren't as heavy so far, the waterlogging situation remains unchanged. Boats now seem to be the new mode of transport for Chennai residents. This post-monsoon season, between October 1 and November 16, Chennai has registered 815 mm rain—a whopping 67% ‘large excess’ compared to its average.

Chennai and several other parts of Tamil Nadu have been receiving heavy rainfall since Saturday, leading to waterlogging and damage to homes. At least five people have died because of the rain and over 1,400 have been moved to relief camps.

On Tuesday, the Madras High Court brought up the flooding in Chennai while hearing a public interest litigation on removing encroachments to ensure that roads in the city are wide enough, The New Indian Express

“What have you been doing since 2015 floods?” Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice PD Audikesavalu asked the Chennai civic body, according to NDTV. “It is a pity that half the year we long for water and rest of the year we are flooded or die in water.”

The floods in Chennai in 2015 were the worst the city had experienced in a century. The floods had killed 289 people, submerged 23.25 lakh homes, disrupted power and telecommunication services and caused extensive damage to public and private property.

At Tuesday’s hearing, Justice Audikesavalu said that the encroachment of water bodies was mainly causing flooding in Chennai, The Hindu reported. He said that Chennai’s civic body should have taken necessary steps to avoid such a situation.

“We are not a backward state,” the judge said. “We are the most advanced state on many parameters. This cannot be the state of a leading state in the country.”

107,646,chennai,2021,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/chennai-floods-climate-crisis-7618776/,12 Nov 2021,We must recognise cities as waterscapes,"Chennai is flooded. The north-east monsoon that has been hovering ominously over Tamil Nadu has brought with it the highest volume of rainfall within 24 hours in the last five years. It has also revived memories of the devastating Chennai floods of 2015, a collective trauma that its residents are yet to outlive.

In the last two decades, floods in South Asia have become urban — erasing the hubris that for long had separated city and country. Floods recur in major cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Dhaka, Karachi and Kathmandu, and accompany high-intensity rainfall events. In October this year, buses have floated down flooded roads in Hyderabad, while in Bengaluru, India’s first “greenfield” international airport got inundated, reclaimed by the water it had hoped to displace and divert with concrete.

In August this year, as monsoon floods raged across the subcontinent, IPCC’s 6th Assessment Report (AR6) was published. The report noted the increasing frequency of heavy precipitation events since the 1950s and inferred that they were being driven by human-induced climate change.

The climate crisis, if there was ever any doubt, is here. It has made extreme rainfall events more severe and unpredictable than ever before. However, it only partially explains the recurrence of urban floods. The complete story lies buried in the politics of land.

All cities in the subcontinent are waterscapes. They are threaded with rivers, speckled with wetlands and springs, and they rest on invisible aquifers. Yet, driven by a thirst for land, our cities are planned to subjugate water, not live with it. It is this land-centrism that undermines urban drainage.

The word drainage is derived from Old English, dreahnian, originally referring to the straining out of a liquid. Urban drainage, if it was to do justice to its etymology, would turn cities into sieves that allowed water to soak and pass through. This required safeguarding the numerous natural watercourses threading the city as they drain water away and sustain fragile groundwater aquifers. These waterways — belittled as natural storm drains or nullahs — have been sacrificed at the altar of land-centric urban growth.

In 2014, Gubbi Labs, a research collective in Bengaluru, established through geospatial imaging that 376 km of natural storm drains — encroached on and paved over — had disappeared from the heart of the Silicon Valley of India.

In 2015, the National Green Tribunal in India formed a committee to report on the status of natural stormwater drains in Delhi. On inspection, out of the 201 “drains” recorded in 1976, 44 were found to be “missing”.

In both cases, these “missing” waterways were either encroached and built over or connected to sewage drains. The apathy for restoring disappearing urban waterways, stands in stark contrast to the Indian government’s recent obsession with reviving ancient rivers.

Poor design and corruption — inseparable bedfellows in South Asian urban planning — significantly contribute to urban floods. Take the design of constructed stormwater drains. The size of their outlets should be based on the intensity of rainfall (mm/per hour) and the peak flow inside the drains. In most South Asian countries, however, either design guidelines are missing, or the outlets are too small to accommodate peak flow. In specific areas of Karachi, for example, stormwater drains from real-estate properties are directed towards main roads. Little surprise then that above-average rainfall produces flooded localities.

Similarly, by violating environmental laws and municipal bye-laws, open spaces, wetlands and floodplains have been mercilessly built over, making cities impermeable and hostile to rainwater. In almost all cities in South Asia, residential properties have been built on stormwater drains. In Karachi, due to such encroachment, the width of drains has been reduced from 200 feet to 20 feet.

Unfortunately, encroachments are always blamed on the urban poor who live precariously in low-lying drainage areas because of inadequate social housing. After the devastating Chennai floods of 2015, experts pointed out that the biggest encroacher of urban waterways and wetlands was actually the state government of Tamil Nadu, which had built runways, bus terminals and IT parks by paving over water bodies.

Ever since concretisation became shorthand for urbanisation, rainfall in a changing climate no longer finds its way towards subterranean capillaries or surface water bodies. Massive quantities of water released during intense short-duration rainfall now get diverted towards drainage networks which are either “missing”, or choked with debris, sewage and solid waste. Whatever water does manage to reach the nearest river finds that the bank has been converted to real estate, and the river bed mined extensively for sand.

The political response to floods has always been to transfer the blame to the skies. Floods were viewed as products of “fickle” monsoons and “unruly” rivers. In response, millions of tons of concrete were and continue to be poured into constructing dams, embankments, culverts, and sea walls. Ironically, as South Asian cities metamorphosed into impervious lumps of concrete, they invited floods closer home.

To heal the hydrophobia that has shaped our urban experience, we need to move away from land-centric urbanisation and recognise cities as waterscapes. We need to let urban rivers breathe by returning them to their floodplains. One restored lake or a reclaimed waterway, though welcome, is no longer adequate. The entire urban watershed needs to heal, and for that to happen, we need less concrete and more democracy and science at the grassroots.

Chennai has seen a redux of what it witnessed in 2015: Some of the worst flooding in recent memory as extremely heavy rainfall pounded the city in the past few days. The city has not learnt any lessons from 2015. It should take a number of measures to prevent a recurrence, according to experts.

Giriraj Amarnath, principal researcher, disaster risk management and climate resilience, at the International Water Management Institute, told Down To Earth (DTE) that Chennai was a very ‘vulnerable’ city.

This was because of its density of population as well as underdeveloped infrastructure and poor management across institutions.

“For example, the coordination between water resources and disaster management authorities needs combined coordination and responsibility for disaster risk management,” he told DTE from Glasgow, where he is attending the 26th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Amarnath’s statement is vindicated by the recent development that government mismanagement could have played a role in the flooding.

Gagandeep Singh Bedi, the commissioner of the Greater Chennai Corporation, found that flooding in the T Nagar neighbourhood of the city had been caused because of the Smart City Project.

The project in T Nagar, a posh residential and commercial locality, included the construction of stormwater drains which have now been found to have faulty construction design. The are still has knee-deep water.

Chief Minister MK Stalin told the media that the earlier All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government had taken ‘bribes’ and had done a ‘haphazard job’ under the Smart City project. Hence, T Nagar had experienced damage due to water-logging.

“We don’t really plant the trees that are required in an urban system. We don’t allow for groundwater recharge. Our drains are still of one metre width and less. They are from British times and need to be upgraded in line with the growing population and rapid development,” Amarnath told DTE.

He noted that Chennai was a very low-lying area and was more or less like a basin from which water cannot escape easily

“It is important to ensure adequate space for river and flood plains to capture discharge given that high-intensity rainfall has increased over the past decades in the city. The city will remain flooded unless you can pump out the water. And pumping out the water will depend upon your readiness and preparedness of flood management,” Amarnath said.

There was a need to translate traditional water infrastructure investment into nature-based solutions, make room for rivers and invest in healthy watersheds.

“City municipalities should work closely with grassroots organisations to promote awareness on holistic flood risk management and participatory approach for a risk-based early action coordination among stakeholders to mitigate flood risks,” Amarnath added.

He said it was also important to utilise the power of digital technologies including satellite data to digitise informal settlements and identify levels of vulnerability for flood protection strategies and government need to ensure timely actionable information including financial supports.",solution,2022 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",16 November 2022,18 November 2022,Chennai city and suburbs,244 mm,"Rs 10,000 crore",18,10 lakh people affected,"The floods were caused by heavy rainfall, which led to flooding of the city's rivers and stormwater drains.

The team also visited Mamallapuram and villages in nearby Chengelpet district that witnessed damage to standing crops.

The Central team was also apprised on initiatives already undertaken, which includes shifting people living in low lying areas to safe shelters. The damage was also illustrated through photo-exhibits.

The second team of three officials, led by consultant, Ministry of Finance, R B Kaul, visited regions in southern Tamil Nadu’s Kanyakumari District.

The Central teams arrived here on November 21 and are scheduled to complete the assessment work in regions, including Vellore and Ranipet and leave for Delhi on Wednesday.

Following the floods in 2015, the state as well as the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) in their budgets had announced several projects to improve the stormwater drain network. Chennai corporation in its 2016-17 budget allocated ₹415 crores for the drainage system.

Between October 2011 and June 2016, the corporation laid around 565 km of new drains. Chennai, as of today, has 2,071 km of stormwater drain network. Civic authorities at that time had also found that a crucial factor that links the drain network was largely either absent or broken, officials said.

‘Missing links’ were identified for 33 locations in Chennai’s central city and 278 locations in the extended areas, they added. Projects to build drains and links receive funding from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and German-based KfW bank to the tune of more than ₹5,000 crores, spanning across the past few years, they said.

A massive integrated stormwater drain network project announced in 2014 by the city corporation to connect them to the four river basins Adyar, Cooum, Kosasthalaiyar, and Kovalam is still in progress.

The area under the Chennai Corporation was expanded from 176 sq km to 426 sq km in 2011, following which the basic road infrastructure for extended areas is still not in place. Based on topography, the corporation and the Public Works Department have divided Chennai into four watershed basins, comprising 12 major catchments. Work for about 406 km of drains for the basins in Adyar and Cooum combined was completed last year and civic officials say that this has helped decrease flooding in the south and central parts of Chennai in the present rains.

“In 2015, water was stagnant in localities such as Valasaravakkam for a week. Due to the new drains, there has been no stagnation,” said a senior civic official not wishing to be named.

The work includes the building of collector drains, feeder drains, arterial drains and macro and major micro canals to prevent flooding. Work is ongoing in the ISWD network to cover 763km for Kosasthalaiyar Basin in north Chennai and 360-km for Kovalam in the south. “It will take two years to complete,” the civic official said.

“The ISWDs are designed in a scientific way to prevent a worst-case scenario, like the 2015 floods.” In 2015, the local body had identified 588 spots where flooding probability was high. However, after the unprecedented rainfall and flooding, the corporation revised this number to around 820.

The coastal city of Chennai is essentially a flat terrain dotted with wetlands where excess water can drain into, but it has been occupied for residential, commercial and industrial projects. A study by Chennai-based biodiversity research organisation Earth Trust states that only 15% of the city’s wetlands are left. Their findings show that Chennai’s built-up area grew from 47 sq km in 1980 to 402 sq km in 2012 - while the area under wetlands declined from 186 sq km to 71sq km during the same period. The study also found that most of the water bodies affected were in the southern and western suburbs.

This can be attributed to the Information Technology boom in Chennai in the 1990s where IT parks came up in the south which was accompanied by increased residential projects.

“Due to overall dense urbanisation where there is too much concrete and tar and no natural buffers like lakes and open spaces, rainwater can’t move anywhere so it stagnates,” said Raj Bhagat, senior manager, GeoAnalytics, World Resources Institute-India.

“Chennai’s terrain is close to the sea level, so you require larger conduits. The stormwater drains are not scientifically designed according to rainfall data though officials may claim that. So when there are no natural buffers and inadequate road infrastructure, Chennai will continue to flood.”

Outside my window, I could see the impact of the nightlong showers -- there was water everywhere.

The water had reached the entrance of our house in West Mambalam, jolting me back to memories of that traumatic period in 2015 when the floods in Chennai resulted in us wading through three-feet-high water within our home. It is not yet as bad as that, but with the rains still not having abated, I cannot help but fear what is to come over the next few days.

On Sunday, Chennai received the heaviest rainfall it has had since 2015. In ten hours, the city recorded about 14 cm of rain. Streets were waterlogged and people’s lives thrown out of gear. The authorities issued a preliminary flood alert and announced that two reservoirs would be opened to let out the surplus rainwater.

As a result of the rainfall, we have had no power since the morning. We must prepare to do without electricity at least for the rest of today -- I am saving up every last percent of my phone’s battery like my life depends on it!

We have stocked up on groceries to ensure we do not have to venture out at least for a couple of days. This, after I scolded my father for going out to get some milk on this rainy morning. It took him one hour to make it back home from the nearby store.

Since then, we have stayed indoors except to go to our relatives’ house nearby to clean up and ensure their valuables are safe. They aren’t in town and the water has not spared their home. Our neighbours in the adjacent flat are also struggling with knee-deep water in their kitchen and bathrooms.

We are better prepared this time. We know what we need and what to do if the tide turns for the worse. 2015 trained us for this.

But can you really be prepared for a situation when basic necessities are out of reach, even your home is not safe from the wrath of nature, you cannot get through to your loved ones who are far and everything you care about could be lost?

I guess not. So now, we wait. And we hope that Chennai will soon breathe a sigh of relief when the clouds clear and the sun comes out again.

Citizens are still staring at an uncertain timeline of whether there will be any rain in the coming days or if and when the waterlogging in their areas subsides.

Just a kilometre away from the Pallikaranai marshland is S Kolathur. The area that is right adjacent to the Narayanapuram lake has become a frequent source of flooding during the rains.

The area was inundated in 2015, 2017, 2019, and now 2021.

“Year after year, we face the same issue. Nothing much has changed. No proper solutions to drain the water have been found in the region,” lamented Shivaraj, a resident of S Kolathur.

Water from 14 water tanks in the west Pallikaranai swamp drains into Narayanapuram lake before returning to the Pallikaranai swamp.

However, neither the Narayanapuram lake nor the nearby Kilkattalai canal has the capacity to drain the water from the 14 tanks. As a result, the majority of the surplus water floods into the S Kolathur neighbourhood.

“We have explained this to the officials. We had sought a 30-foot-wide drainage channel on either side of the Pallikaranai radial road to allow the water to drain into the marshland. That has not been done yet; only a 12-foot-wide channel is being laid, and the work is still halfway through,” alleged a resident.

He further added, ""A Rs 20-crore canal that is 7 feet high has been built here, but it doesn't serve the purpose. Instead of draining the water from here to the lake, water from the canal is seeping into this area. Instead of making a 7-foot-high canal, they made 3-foot-high proper canals.

“The irrigation canal could have at least been built properly,” said the resident.

“Everywhere the area saw water, families with young children suffered even to get basic essentials. I have a baby at home. For the last two hours, I have been out of my house to just get a packet of milk for my child. The water levels are high and unsafe to walk on, so we have to wait for a tractor to get in and out of the area,"" said another resident.

As we entered the area in a tractor to assess the situation, one of the first houses was Uma's. She had five people working to just remove the water and sand that seeped into her home.

Uma not only looked after her pets, but she also housed many street dogs on her roof as the water level rose. ""I don't have anything more to do now. I raised my house after seeing the situation in the previous floods, but even now, water is inside the house,” Uma said.

""Though the previous collector came and marked the encroachments and assured me of a solution for the flooding that happened here in 2015, nothing has really changed,"" she added.

As we moved deeper into the interior parts of the area, we found a food delivery agent who had walked into the water above knee level to deliver the food he had picked up.

""I've been trying to get this food delivered for the past 45 minutes. There is no way to find out where the person is. I can't cancel the order, and if I do, I'll have to pay a Rs 500 fine,"" said the delivery agent.

Meanwhile, residents in S Kolathur's inner areas reported that ""water levels were up to our chests, making it extremely dangerous for us. Snakes, lizards, and other insects have also entered our homes through this water.""

""In addition, there is sewage water present. Many of the homes in this area have had no access to water, milk, or food. We've been looking for help for people going out. We're coming out with our children only to show you our sorry state and hope that someone will intervene,"" a man holding a child said.

People in affected areas have only one pertinent question: when will normalcy be restored? When will there be a long-term solution to this problem?

Authorities should have realised that there was no space to release city’s floodwater, pointed out Pushpendra Johari, Senior Vice-President, Sustainability, at consultancy RMSI.

Early warning system

There has been no plan to have early warning flood forecasting systems as revealed by the height of flood water in different locations. Neither was there any published plan on mitigating and reducing the impact of an upcoming flood event.

Johari points to the absence of an urgent action plan for implementing high-resolution flood forecasting systems that could pinpoint the best potential water level estimates across locations. Strict measures should also be taken to improve the stormwater drainage system and remove encroachments on water bodies and drains.

Excerpts from an interview:

Floods this year have more or less coincided with the COP26 in Glasgow. What are the key takeaways for Chennai, a coastal city?

The COP26 ended with national pledges that put the world on a track of 2.4 Deg Celsius rise in temperature. So now, a 1.5 Deg Celsius rise is no longer the best-case scenario, as published by an IPCC report earlier.

Ocean waters are going to take up considerable parts of coastal cities such as Chennai. The Chennai and Thiruvallur districts will be the most impacted in Tamil Nadu.

According to RMSI research, many residential buildings situated along the coast in the low-lying Mullima Nagar, Ennore and Talanguppam as also a few buildings at the Chennai Port Trust, Bharathi Dock building, Gospel Church and businesses along the coast risk being potentially affected by inundation due to increase in sea-level rise. This threat will be further amplified due to the increasing intensity of cyclones and depressions.

What is the grace period that you allow Chennai to buck up or else?

We already got the first alarm in the 2015 floods. Unfortunately, we have no more time left to act and should work on a deadline as if there’s no tomorrow.

Chennai has not since witnessed as large a flood event as of 2015, but there has been an alarming rise in the occurrence of flood-like situations after 2015. The city must work on its defences on priority and complete them on a mission mode.

What best can be done best in the short-to-medium term and just in time for the next monsoon?

A detailed flood risk assessment at the city level should be done to identify flood hotspots. Based on the identification of potential locations, the government should plan temporary mitigation options around these hotspots.

Temporary flood protection measures like inflatable water bags, water gates and flood gates should be deployed in areas that are expected to be inundated to reduce the flood impact.

Chennai needs an efficient flood forecasting system with a high-resolution digital elevation model that embeds a Decision Support System. This will help anticipate what heights water levels could rise a few days before the flood occurs. Such a system will drastically reduce the impact of floods in the city.

The detailed flood risk assessment will also guide on the long-term action plan considering :

o Improvement in the stormwater drainage system of the city

o Flood zoning on city-scale to implement new construction guidelines

o Removal of existing encroachments on water bodies and drains in the city

RMSI points out that generally, during this time of the year, low-pressure systems over the Bay of Bengal bring heavy rainfall over the coastal areas accompanied by thunderstorms. Due to the lower speed of lateral movement of these systems, they stay for a much longer, causing widespread rainfall, often leading to floods.",solution,2022 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2022","December 10, 2022","['Chennai', 'Thiruvallur']","['200 mm, 300 mm']","['100 crore, 200 crore']","['10, 20']","['Damage to infrastructure', 'Loss of livelihood', 'Displacement of people']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Heavy overnight rain led to flooding in several areas of Chennai on Sunday. Nungambakkam recorded 21.5 cm of rainfall, the highest recorded in a 24-hour period since 2015 .

Tamil Nadu has received a 43% surplus rainfall and Chennai registered a 26% excess since October 1.

Following rain in the catchment areas leading to heavy inflows, the State Government gradually began releasing surplus water from reservoirs around Chennai including Poondi and Chembarambakkam. From an initial 500 cusecs, the discharge from Chembarambakkam was increased to 2,000 cusecs in the evening.

With more heavy rain forecast for the city over the next 48 hours, Chief Minister M.K. Stalin announced a two-day holiday for schools in Chennai, Tiruvallur, Chengalpet and Kancheepuram districts. He visited flooded areas in the city and directed officials to ensure food supply for residents displaced and affected by the floods.

Four teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) will be deployed in Madurai and Chengalpet, the Chief Minister said, adding that the NDRF, fire and police personnel are also engaged in rescue and relief operations in the city. He also advised those planning to return to the city after the Deepavali break to defer the trip by another two days.

While Chennai received over 20 cm of rainfall, 10 districts including Karur, Tiruvallur, Namakkal, Pudukottai, Sivaganga, Tiruchi, Virudhunagaralso received heavy rain, Mr. Stalin said.

Roads in 166 residential areas including places like Villivakkam, T Nagar, Alwarpet, Pulianthope, Vysarpadi, Velachery, RA Puram, Kolathur, Rajakilpakkam, Avadi, Ambattur, Pallikaranai and Saidapet reported severe waterlogging.

With water logging and fallen trees, traffic was disrupted and diverted in several areas. Subways were closed for vehicle movement during the day as water level rose. Power supply for some areas was cut off due to inundation as a precautionary measure.

Corporation Commissioner Gagandeep Singh Bedi said the flood monitoring officials have visited the 15 zones to undertake relief measures.

“In addition to 570 pumps in the city at various places, 67 pumps have been used to bale out water. We visited areas such as Kolathur, Villivakkam and Egmore. The problem is that the water did not drain into Korattur Channel, Retteri as well as Kodungaiyur channel, which drains into Buckingham canal. With the high tide, Buckingham Canal was full and the flow of water was slow,” he said.

The Chief Minister also announced one day’s holiday to all State government departments in Chennai on Monday except essential departments such as electricity, PWD, municipal administration, health, revenue, transport and Aavin.

He also requested private companies to consider following suit considering the rainfall situation or to provide work from home option for a day. The Chief Minister also directed officials to conduct regular health camps to prevent the spread of diseases during the monsoon.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Fears of the situation getting worse gripped many people as the meteorological department forecast heavy and continuous rains across the State till Wednesday and heavy showers with thunderstorms for Chennai till Monday.

Director of Meteorology N Puviarasan said many districts were getting heavy rains under the influence of a cyclonic surface circulation in the Bay of Bengal and that more heavy rains could be expected in the days to come. The rain havoc would be spread across the State from Chennai to Kanaykumari, though the coastal districts may be more affected.

Though the rain forecast is that one section of the State would be hit one day, the flood situation is such that any rain anywhere could cause inundation everywhere as all reservoirs, lakes, tanks, ponds and every water body is already full and cannot take any more inflow.

On Saturday morning people woke up to water entering their homes in many localities in Chennai and even the others could not step out as the streets and roads went under knee-deep water with overnight rains lashing the city and its suburbs non-stop even after daybreak.

Many subways went under water despite giant pumps continuously working at various spots and in Vyasarpadi, a passenger bus got stuck inside the inundated Ganesapuram subway, forcing the authorities to engage another vehicle to tow it out to safety.

The bus had entered the subway as the water level was maintained at a reasonable height by the motor that was continuously pumping out when a sudden gush caused a flood inside, trapping the vehicle with passengers on board.

Though the commuters disembarked, waded through the water and ran to safety, the vehicle remained stranded, leading to a traffic snarl in the locality, till it was towed out. Many episodes of two-wheelers, auto rickshaws and cars with low ground clearance stopping in the flooded roads were reported, providing additional work to mechanics.

It was the overflowing lakes around Chennai, say in places like Ambattur, Medavakkam, Korattur, Adyar, Pallikaranai and Velacherry that caused more flooding in the residential areas around them.

Many stranded people were rescued and transported to places of safety by the flat bottomed rubber boats operated by the fire and rescue services and also the personnel of the National Disaster Response Force.

Though such boats had been operated ever since the rains started flooding many areas and roads, more of them were required on Friday as more and more went under water with more lakes and tanks started overflowing.

In what is known as the Palar region, covering Chennai, Kanchipuram, Chengalpattu and Tiruvannamalai districts through which River Palar traverses, water from 962 of the total 1022 lakes have started spilling out.

The lack of adequate men and machinery to clear the water stagnation in many places, as too many calls were received at the same time, caused resentment among people who sat in protest in many areas like Ramavaram and other low-lying areas.

Many families were found huddling in safety of their terrace or first floor space with water gushing into their dwelling space in the night, triggering fears of earlier flood havocs when people went without food for days and depending on the packets dropped from air.

Traffic diversions caused widespread chaos on the otherwise flooded roads and motorists found it difficult to negotiate through the heavily damaged roads that were left with potholes and puddles. The random parking of four-wheelers on top of most of the bridges by people, too, restricted the free movement of vehicles.

The heavy rains led to the closing of schools in 23 districts though the downpour was widespread across most districts. All over the State 123 relief camps had been opened to accommodate 11,329 people even as three more lives were lost and 344 heads of cattle perished.",flood,2022 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2022","December 5, 2022","Chennai, Kanchipuram, Chengalpattu, Tiruvannamalai districts",1000 mm,1000 crores,10,"100,000 people displaced","The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, overflowing lakes and tanks, and poor drainage.

The current Chennai floods are all over social media now, stark in the photos of inundated streets and water logging in many homes, especially those on the ground floor. The chaos has evoked angry and anguished responses from residents. There has been a chorus of demands, asking why the city’s stormwater drain network was unable to handle the rains and how the city would hold up in the event of further downpours that are predicted.

As part of a group of residents who suffered a similar fate during the Chennai floods of 2015, I would like to share my experience on how we managed to avert a similar situation this time. The years after the 2015 floods saw the residents of a few streets of Mandaveli come together to invest time and effort to ensure that the plight they suffered would not be repeated. That we succeeded to a large extent is evident from the fact that we have been able to avoid water-logging in the face of the rain fury a couple of days back.

Understanding flooding in our area

The TP Scheme Road where the Tamil Nadu Urban Development Project office is located now was totally submerged during the rains of 2015. Similarly the entrance of Velayutha Raja street and Kandaswamy Street which were the entrance roads to the inner streets of Raja street used to develop huge ponds after the mildest shower. Pedestrians and motorists used to find it very difficult to enter from these roads.

The RWAs of Mandaveli Raja Street and Poonga View had been formed at that point but we were not aware of the actual reason as to why the water logging occurred. During this time a group of good Samaritans in the area, including C R Balaji, a civic activist, helped educate the people about stormwater drains.

We attended an audit organised by Arappor Iyakkam which was very enlightening. We went in without knowing what kind of civic infrastructure is present in our streets but came out well-informed. This is when we realised why there was widespread flooding in our streets.

SWD audits after Chennai floods

Once we got an idea about how the system works, we were more proactive in requesting the corporation officials for regular desilting, and audited the process whenever desilting of stormwater drains was undertaken. We built a rapport with the Assistant Engineer (AE) who oversees the works.

When the work was actually undertaken, a team of residents walked down with them and pointed out wherever they had spotted issues, such as mixing of sewage with stormwater or broken covers which let garbage enter the SWD. Many a time, the stormwater drains share chambers with sewage chambers, or cracked sewage pipelines cross over the SWD, so that sewage mixes with the stormwater flow; this is a critical issue that must be addressed if floods are to be avoided.

We also showed the officials the spots where there was excess silt and pushed for regular removal.

Process and results

Ensuring proper drainage requires sustained efforts and is a continuous process. We hit roadblocks such as when the Poonga shut off the drainage system from Raja Street and Poonga View Road, as mixed sewage was affecting marine life. With the help of the Corporation, this contamination was addressed. We have had many discussions on this subject with various officials over the years.

As a result of the regular audits that were conducted by us, we realised that parts of Poonga View Road, Raja Street and the entire TP Scheme Road, Velayutha Raja Street and Kandasamy Street did not have a complete, connected stormwater drain network. We petitioned GCC and also raised the issue in the media and whenever the AE visited, we pointed out the problems and submitted reports of the audits conducted by the community. It took two years to secure a go-ahead for the SWD completion project. The result of this work was put to test during the recent Chennai floods.

Where once the roads were submerged and vehicles were a no go after the rains, we saw very little stagnation of water. What helped is also the construction of recharge wells at the sloping end point of Velayutha Raja Street, Raja Street, Kandaswamy Street and TP Scheme Road. We pooled funds and secured the permission to lay the recharge wells as we felt that only the excess water should go into the Stormwater Drains.

Also, when tar roads were relaid in Raja Street, the RWA followed up with the officials to make sure that the entire road was milled and laid. The exact location of the recharge wells and stormwater drains was conveyed to the officials in charge of the road work, so that they ensured the slope in such a way that water automatically flows into the drains.

Working with officials

The key learning for us from this experience has been the importance of continuous interaction and follow ups with officials. We have learnt that we must not shut our doors when civic works are carried out but instead try to understand the process.

Residents took active interest in civic works in the area. Pic: Ganga Sridhar

If we wait for the work to be completed to spot the flaws, it is often too late and hence ineffectual; on the contrary, a proactive approach could prevent issues from the start and ensure an effective solution to the problem. We have found that working with officials and interacting with workers usually help nip issues at the bud and also solve additional problems that may be present in the area.

Ministry of Finance’s Department of Economic Affairs Additional Secretary Rajat Kumar Mishra and ADB Country Director for India Takeo Konishi signed the agreement for the Integrated Urban Flood Management for the Chennai–Kosasthalaiyar River Basin Project on Tuesday, an ADB press release said.

Chennai’s rapid urbanisation has encroached on the city’s natural landscape, reducing water retention capacity, which makes the city vulnerable to widespread flooding. The project will involve construction of 588 km of new stormwater drains, rehabilitate or replace 175 km of stormwater drains, improve 11 km stretches in the Ambattur, Ariyallur, Kadappakkam, and Korattur channels to enhance water-carrying capacity, and upgrade a stormwater pumping station and construct a new one. It will also construct 23,000 catchpits in roadside drains to recharge the groundwater aquifer and rehabilitate four disaster relief camps.

‘Reduce vulnerability’

“The project interventions will help reduce the vulnerability of Chennai–Kosasthalaiyar basin residents to frequent floods, which have in recent years destroyed property and livelihoods,” said Mishra after signing the loan agreement.

“The project will build flood protection infrastructure as well as strengthen the capacity of the Greater Chennai Corporation and communities for better preparedness planning to transform Chennai into a more livable city. The innovative designs and interventions for climate-resilient flood management promoted by the project, along with integrated urban planning and enhanced municipal resource mobilisation, can be widely replicated for other Indian cities that are vulnerable to climate and disaster risks,” said Konishi.

The South Central Railway (SCR) and the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) have cancelled many bus and train services to Tamil Nadu in view of the damage done to the railway tracks and several breaches developed on the National Highway during the recent rains.

More trains bound to Nellore, Tirupati and Chennai were cancelled on Monday. Railway tracks the Nellore-Padugupadu section have been damaged. The officials were camping at Padugupadu and taking measures to repair the tracks.

The platforms at the Vijayawada railway station wore a deserted look on Monday, while passengers were seen enquiring at the helpdesk about the resumption of services. Some passengers cancelled their journeys in the wake of cancellation of trains towards Chennai.

The APSRTC has partially cancelled services to Chennai due to damage of bridges on the national highway. Many bus services from Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Ongole and other depots have been suspended, the RTC officials said.

APSRTC Managing Director Ch. Dwaraka Tirumala Rao said that instructions had been issued to the officials to take all safety precautions while operating services in the rain-hit districts.

“Road link has been cut off near Gudur and other places due to floods. We are running buses to Chennai depending on the need. Senior officers are monitoring the situation,” said APSRTC Executive Director (Operations) K.S. Brahmananda Reddy.

Many software professionals, traders and students, who returned to Andhra Pradesh in the week-end got struck in their native towns as the train and bus services were cancelled.

“I came to my native place Gudivada to for a week. But, the heavy rains and flash floods damaged the bridges, roads and tracks, forcing me to stay back. I am planning to return to my workplace by flight,” said Francis, an advocate.

Fears of floods of the scale of the 2015 deluge are looming over Chennai where at least five people have died in rain-related incidents since last week. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted widespread rainfall in Tamil Nadu in the coming days, with forecasts of heavy to very heavy rainfall in Chennai.

The northeast monsoon unleashed its fury in the state last week, swamping large parts of residential areas and commercial centres.

The answer is a mix of affirmative and negative. A combination of technological and religious reasons (radar glitches and Diwali festive mood) led to misjudgement of the severity of the rainfall and flooding. Chennai recorded 200 millimetres (mm) of rainfall on the night of November 6.

State officials are concerned because no rainfall alert was issued ahead of the downpour. It was announced that the city is under a green-coded (no warning, no action) alert for until November 10.

Is it the lack of a reliable radar weather system the main reason? North Chennai has received the heaviest rainfall but low-lying areas like Velachery and Palikarnai were massively flooded.

Semmancheri, the town that was the worst-hit during the 2015 deluge, was not flooded this time.

It should be noted that there is a striking similarity between the events leading to the 2015 floods and the active northeast monsoon’s tango with the city at present.

Rainfall since the onset of the northeast monsoon this year in Chennai has already filled the reservoirs and drainage systems. On November 8, 2015, Chennai was alerted of a low depression across the Bay of Bengal. The city received 399 millimetres rainfall in five days in November 2015. This year, it recorded 200 mm in one night (November 6).

The 26th Conference of Parties (CoP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is in its second week but has not seen any substantial progress. The case of Chennai should be a reminder and evidence of the statement made in the Sixth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that “unpredictability of climate moods is the only predictable truth”.

Will the newly constructed, completed or proposed, stormwater drainage projects be a game changer to ward off flooding in Chennai? There is no convincing answer so far as we continue to witness rainfall since last week.

There is a structural flaw in integrating various stormwater drainage systems funded by bilateral and multilateral agencies but implemented by Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) into a holistic network of drainage systems which allows excess water to flow through.

The city is waterlogged for over two days despite having stormwater drains in its core areas. It is imperative to integrate the networks of stormwater drains funded by various agencies to make it a natural network, besides finding the structural flaws and corruptions involved. We hope that the Asian Development Bank with GCC will address the immediate challenge through its ongoing project.

However, in contrast to 2015 floods, incremental improvements can be seen across the institutions dealing with climate induced disasters in Chennai. GCC has been more proactive than the responses during the 2015 floods.

Contact details posted in GCC website is one of the right means to allow access to information and responses rather than solely depending on Rippon building (GCC office).

However, the next two days of intense rain, as predicted by IMD, would be a litmus test for the GCC.

Initially, leadership matters when it comes to disaster risk management. That is reflected in Chennai as well.

Both the chief minister and GCC Commissioner have been taking stock of the situation from ground-zero as well as reaching out to vulnerable communities in distress. Proactive and preemptive information sharing and communication as well as early warning system are the mainstay of successful disaster risk reductions.

Experience drawn from COVID-19 responses so far in the city has helped in implementing several short-term and long-term measures by GCC in the wake of heavy rainfall and consequent floods.

GCC has established a flood grievance redress mechanism and over a hundred relief centres in 15 risk zones for sheltering affected people as well as rendering immediate rescue and relief services. All schools under GCC are being opened for accommodating flood-affected people.

Food and medical supplies are being arranged for the people whose dwellings are damaged or inundated due to rain. Several community kitchens have been made operational.

Rescue boats are kept on standby at all risk zones. Water is being pumped out and canals are being de-clogged constantly wherever it's necessary to remove the excess water.

‘Zero loss’ has been the motto from the beginning for the present Tamil Nadu government in facing the deluge. The GCC seems to be better prepared than the 2015 December flood scenario.

The corporation seems to have revised the 2017 City Disaster Management Plan and posted an improved version as the City Disaster Management Perspective Plan (CDMPP) 2021 in September.

The CDMPP is more comprehensive and inclusive in nature than its previous version. It recognises and acknowledges both structural and non-structural interventions to make Chennai a resilient city.

Here’s hoping that people of Chennai will bravely face the coming rains in the coming days and extend help to each other.

Short and intense spells of rain in the past two days have left several areas of Chennai inundated. This was in direct contrast to the rainfall pattern observed in November 2020 when Cyclone Nivar made landfall. At that time, though the amount of rainfall was more, it was distributed over three days and did not pour down in brief and intense spells, restricting the floods to only vulnerable localities.

More rainfall in 2020, but in longer spells

The graph below shows rainfall recorded in Nungambakkam, every 15 minutes starting from 9.15 pm on Nov. 23, 2020 to 1.30 pm on Nov. 26, 2020. In the 64 hours, the station received 320.5 mm of rainfall.

Less rainfall in 2021, but in short & intense spells

The graph below shows rainfall recorded in Nungambakkam, every 15 minutes starting from 12 am on Nov. 5, 2021 till 2.45 pm on Nov. 7, 2021. In the 63 hours, the station recorded 252.6 mm of rain, much less than 2020. Nearly 21cm rainfall was received in Nungambakkam in the 24 hours ending at 8.30 a.m. on Nov. 7. About 23cm rainfall was received in the DGP office station in the 24 hours ending at 8.30 a.m. on Nov. 7. While the total rainfall received was lower in 2021, it still led to waterlogging as large amounts of rainfall came down in short time periods, unlike 2020.

The charts show inflow (blue column), outflow (red column) in 1,000 cusecs and storage level in % (yellow line) in reservoirs at 6 a.m. on Nov 6, 6 a.m. and 4 p.m. on Nov. 7. In Poondi, Red Hills and Chembarambakkam inflows swelled to more than 2,000 cusecs by 4 p.m. on Nov. 7.

In Poondi and Red Hills, the storage levels were close to 90% while in the other two, it was near 85%. Extremely heavy rainfall (>204 mm) will likely occur in Chennai on Nov. 10 and 11.

The Tamil Nadu Water Resources Department on Sunday issued a flood alert in Chennai suburbs following heavy rains and as the Poondi or Sathyamurthy Sagar Reservoir, which is the main drinking water source for Chennai, is expected to reach its full capacity.

With the rising water level, the reservoir has commenced releasing surplus water since 2 p.m. on Sunday.

The Department has already informed the administration of Tiruvallur district to relocate people living close to the banks of the Kosathaliyar river, including people living downstream in Manali and Ennore.

According to a Department statement, the Poondi dam has a storage level height of 35 feet and with the water expected to touch a height of 34 feet, surplus water would be discharged.

On Sunday, the water level has already touched 33.95 feet and if there is further increase of flow due to incessant rains, more water would be released in phases.

The IMD had also forecast heavy rains in Chennai and suburbs including in Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu, and Tiruvallur districts for Sunday and Monday.

On Monday morning, he let out a shriek when he spotted a snake that lay still on the window of the room where his seven-year old son was attending online classes in – the reptile having floated in on the standing water gathering outside on the road.

Three days later, the Mahendran family is marooned in one room of their home, the water level only rising. “There is four feet of water outside our home, and it has entered the living room. I only pray it doesn’t enter the one room we are now in,” said Mahendran over the phone.

These rain- battered scenes are not unfamiliar to Chennai, particularly after the devastation of the 2015 floods that killed 400 people, and thus Mahendran has been preparing. “I have the habit of stocking up because I have two sons who are five and seven, and I didn’t want to take a chance. So we have been able to manage for now but I don’t know how many days we will have to remain like this.”

Across Chennai on Thursday, Mahendran’s plight was echoed by thousands of citizens. Families either trapped inside their homes because the streets outside are waterlogged, or on higher floors or rooftops because the water entered their homes, carrying only their identity cards and a few spare clothes. Trapped inside, across a metropolitan city where the civic infrastructure is collapsing under pressure, many were even seen using ropes to lower buckets from higher floors to the ground, where volunteers in boats passed on essentials like milk, bread packets, cooked food and water cans.

On the streets of the metropolis, inflated rescue boats were as visible as wheeled vehicles, deployed across the city in Madhavaram, Madippakkam, Velachery, T Nagar, Peravallur, Perambur and Pattalam. With many just stranded where they were, unable to step out, only 40 of 160 government shelters set up in the city were occupied on Thursday.

In areas like Pattalam in central Chennai, the continued rainfall only added to the sheets of water stagnating for the past four days. This, locals said, had affected not only homes but businesses too. B Rama, who runs a grocery shop said, “We shut shop on Sunday and we haven’t been able to go back. All our rice stock has submerged.” Rama said that there had also been no electricity for the past four days, and therefore for any supplies, people were having to step out, braving the weather. “Women here are walking through chest-deep water,” said B Rama who has a rice shop in Pattalam.

Power supply to more than 60,000 houses across the city were suspended as a safety measure in Chennai, electricity minister Senthil Balaji told reporters on Thursday. But this also affected water supply in tanks. Ram Mohan, a resident of Madhavaram in north Chennai, where almost every road is submerged, said, “We have been stuck at home since Sunday and now they have cut off power too. The rain water has mixed with sewage and garbage. So not only are we immobile until the waters recede but we don’t know what infections this would lead to,” he said.

And yet, even as parts of Chennai struggled to deal with the crisis, some tried to keep the cheer, albeit with a little government help, and when that wasn’t possible, helped each other. With early November being wedding season, vernacular television news showed visuals of the fire department using a boat to take back a wedding couple and their guests from a submerged marriage hall to their home in T Nagar.

In Perambur, families living in a high-rise apartment got together to cook meals for their less fortunate neighbours. “Most of them are slums so they have moved to government shelters,” said a resident Narendra Jain. “We have all stocked up when the rains subsided on Monday and Tuesday and we are safe indoors. So starting today we decided to cook for about poor 500 families who live next to us and are really struggling in four feet deep water.”

In Velachery, the lessons from 2015 brought a strange sight on Thursday, with rows of vehicles parked atop a flyover. Velachery, residents said, was low lying, and had seen much damage to life and property six years ago. “The 2015 floods are so fresh in everyone’s minds that nobody wants to take a risk. Most of the cars on the flyover will have a registration starting with the same series because that was the series that came out after the 2015 floods when many of these people lost their cars,” said local resident E Sunalini.

Sunalini herself was marooned back in 2015 in Jafferkhanpet where she recalled water was 12-feet high. People then were swimming in these localities to warn their neighbours or pass any information. The following year Sunalini moved to Velachery but has been lucky thus far -- her street has not flooded. “The storm water drains built here recently are making a lot of difference but the surrounding areas are still heavily water logged.”

Back in Madipakkam, four kilometers away from Velachery, Mahendran has been desperately trying to find a way out. Outside his window, where the snake once was, civic body workers have been using motor pumps to drain the water. “But even when they do, the water returns in half an hour,” said Mahendran. For now, he is waiting, and praying that the worst is over.

Some parts of Besant Nagar and Thiruvanmiyur that are usually not prone to waterlogging have been under sheets of water since the start of this northeast monsoon.

Residents complained that speed-breakers in some of the junctions of roads had led to waterlogging in their areas.

Beach Road, Kalakshetra Colony, Besant Avenue, Jeevarathinam Nagar, Adyar and seaward roads in Thiruvanmiyur were covered with rainwater.

M.Srikrishna, a resident of Fifth Avenue, Besant Nagar, said the speed-breakers on Besant Nagar Third Avenue and Tiger Varadhachari Road-Beach Road junction were more of an obstacle for rainwater.

Water had been stagnating for many days now and had entered many houses in the adjoining roads after spells of heavy rain. Residents said as these areas had sandy soil, rainwater drained quickly even during 2015 floods. Every time the roads are laid, their height rises causing inundation of houses.

Sekar Raghavan, director, Rain Centre and Besant Nagar resident, said water stagnated inside some apartments because of groundwater saturation as the city had been getting good rains for many months now. Indiscriminate paving was another reason for such waterlogging on the roads, he said.

His home in Chennai’s T Nagar had ankle deep water, and his furniture was floating in it. Water was everywhere, but there was not a drop to drink -- pipes and taps were all running dry. His 96-year-old mother needed to be physically lifted to an apartment on a higher floor. Submerged under the water were the apartment’s electrical boxes, and therefore no power could be turned on for fear of electrocution.

Jayaraman’s story is one of many in T Nagar, and indeed several parts of Chennai, battered by rain over the weekend. Sunday, with 210mm, was the highest rainfall Chennai has received on a single day in the month of November since 2015. Most in T Nagar moved away for the short term, even checking in to hotels. Some parts of Chennai are still waterlogged, or without power since the weekend, but some arterial roads are relatively clear as the administration is using pumps to drain the water out.

T Nagar is the city’s famous commercial and residential hub, and also the location picked to be developed under the Union government’s Smart Cities Mission. Jayaraman has lived here since the 1980s, and has had to shift temporarily like this twice. The first time was in December 2015, when a combination of unprecedented rainfall and the sudden release of water from the Chembarambakkam lake left more than 400 dead in Tamil Nadu.

Six years later, the toll may be lower, but very little seems to have changed in terms of preparation.

While temporary work was done – real lessons have not yet been learnt, such as removing encroachments on flood plains, river basins still polluted with dumping of fly ash, silt and garbage which affect their carrying capacity, and storm water drains that are clearly failing under duress.

Four days of rain have brought Tamil Nadu to a standstill, with homes damaged, villages marooned, roads cut off, people forced to find higher ground, and a collapsing civic infrastructure. While 11 people have died across five districts, 94 cattle deaths have been reported across the state, and 950 huts damaged. Lakes and tanks in districts like Chennai, Cuddalore and Villupuram are filled up to their brims, and farm lands inundated. The government has provided food for 202,350 people since Sunday and boats have also been deployed to rescue people in Chennai and its adjoining regions.

And it is likely to get worse.

WHAT LIES AHEAD

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert -- the colour code meaning “take action”, the highest level of warning -- for the next two days. The Met has said that there are likely to be thunderstorms with heavy to very heavy rains, and in isolated places extremely heavy rainfall across seven districts in Tamil Nadu, including Chennai, and in Puducherry. The other six districts are Cuddalore, Villupuram, Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Ranipet.

Chennai received 210 mm overnight from November 6 to November 7, receiving 14.8mm, 11 mm, and 33.5 mm on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. On Wednesday, Tamil Nadu received a total of 94 mm of rainfall.

Even as the city got a brief respite from Tuesday, with 14.7mm rainfall until 5.30am on Wednesday, rain picked up after that, increasing to 23.7mm till 3.30pm. The situation continued to be grim in the coastal districts of Nagapattinam and Karaikal, which experienced 245mm and 272mm rainfall respectively in the intervening night between November 9 and 10.

The Regional Meteorological Centre in a statement said that under the influence of the cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal, a low pressure formed on Tuesday morning.

“Yesterday’s (Tuesday’s) low pressure area over southeast Bay of Bengal and its neighbourhood, organised into a well marked low pressure area over central parts of south Bay of Bengal with the associated cyclonic circulation extending up to 5.8km above mean sea level,” their updated statement on Wednesday said. “It is likely to concentrate into a depression over southwest Bay of Bengal during next 12 hours, move west–northwest wards and reach near north the Tamil Nadu coast by the early morning of 11 November.”

Thereafter, it is likely to continue to move northwestward and cross north Tamil Nadu and south Andhra Pradesh coast between Karaikal and Sriharikota around Cuddalore by the evening of 11th November.

“It is possible we will cross 20 cm of rain in the next two days,” said deputy director of Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), V Puviarasan. Tamil Nadu receives maximum rainfall during the northeast monsoon from October to December with an average rainfall of 449 mm and 784 in Tamil Nadu and Chennai, respectively, according to RMC data. “This year the chances of receiving above-normal rainfall in November is very high,” said independent weather blogger Pradeep John. “We have received 75% of the average rainfall already and we have more low pressures forming in the coming days,” he said.

PLAYING CATCH-UP

Three additional rain related deaths were reported in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday, taking the toll in just two days to eight.Ten NDRF teams are on stand-by including three in Chennai as Tamil Nadu braces for more rainfall.

“No boats are at sea now,” minister for revenue and disaster management minister KSSR Ramachandran said in Chennai, with the government on Wednesday appointing 10 IAS officers to supervise precautionary measures. About 3,154 people have been moved to a 100 relief camps operations across the state. In Chennai, 1,343 people been accommodated in 22 shelters.

“We have taken up a number of steps to prepare for more rains,” said Gagandeep Singh Bedi, commissioner, Greater Chennai Corporation. “We have put up 46 boats anticipating emergencies.” The civic body has placed motor pumps in all vulnerable spots including 33 heavy duty pumps in flood-prone areas. Medical teams are stationed in each of the 200 wards of Chennai for screening people for Covid-19, water and airborne infections. “We are preparing for the worst,” said Bedi.

With snakes entering some homes, the government has included snake catchers as part of its volunteer team working in rescue operations.

WHAT REALLY AILS CHENNAI

Activists and environmentalists say that installing pumps are a temporary solution, and that the city will continue to flood due to unrestrained urbanisation on floodplains and water courses, inefficient designing of storm water drains, and Chennai’s natural flat topography.

“Urban planning in Chennai should look at ways to recharge ground water through recharge wells and rain water harvesting,” said Pooja Kumar, coordinator, Coastal Resource Centre. “That’s what we need to do rather than just tackling run off where there is no space for percolation of water to the ground. They are looking at engineering solutions for a problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach.”

Raj Bhagat, senior manager, GeoAnalytics, World Resources Institute-India said that only if the new government starts now to make a disaster management plan which is scientific, the situation could improve in a 10-year period.

“Water can move (naturally) only two ways -- downstream and underground. Both are blocked. There is no audit to check if the storm water drains are designed scientifically based on rainfall data. And where is the local governance when Chennai has had no mayor and councillors for four years?” The term of the Chennai’s elected council ended in 2017 and no local body elections have followed, and thus the city has had no mayor or councillors for its 200 wards.

POLITICS AMID THE RAIN

While the Madras high court pulled up the Chennai corporation on Tuesday, and asked if they had not learnt lessons from the 2015 floods, politicians continued to visit flood-hit areas, and the ruling DMK and the opposition AIADMK continued to spar.

For the third straight day, chief minister M K Stalin was on the ground on Wednesday visiting some of the worst-affected areas in Chennai and overseeing rescue operations from the state disaster management control room. On Tuesday, he blamed the previous AIADMK for “looting funds”, and said that he would form an enquiry commission, while former CM Edappadi Palaniswami rebutted this by saying that it was the Smart City project that had helped reduce flooding.

Responding to reporters on Wednesday, Stalin said that Palaniswami was frustrated after losing the elections.

“He is born to lie. He is frustrated that DMK is doing so well,” Stalin said. “Our job is public service. We are meeting people directly, listening to their problems and providing relief.” Stalin has also announced that Amma Canteens- the budget canteens launched by late AIADMK chief minister J Jayalalithaa for the poor-- will offer free food till the end of the rainy season.

But while the politics continues, Jayaraman waits at his relatives home in Chrompet, praying for the rains to pass. He knows it will be a while before he can return to T Nagar, and that more flooding will occur. But there is little reckoning of what state his home will be in when he does.",,Chennai Floods 2021,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",2021-11-06,2021-11-11,"['Chennai', 'Cuddalore', 'Villupuram', 'Chengalpattu', 'Kancheepuram', 'Tiruvallur', 'Ranipet']","['210 mm, 14.8 mm, 11 mm, 33.5 mm, 94 mm']","['950 huts damaged, 11 deaths']",,"['homes damaged', 'villages marooned', 'roads cut off', 'people forced to find higher ground', 'collapsing civic infrastructure']","['the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for the next two days', 'the situation continued to be grim in the coastal districts of Nagapattinam and Karaikal', 'the civic body has placed motor pumps in all vulnerable spots including 33 heavy duty pumps in flood-prone areas', 'the Madras high court pulled up the Chennai corporation on Tuesday', 'chief minister M K Stalin was on the ground on Wednesday visiting some of the worst-affected areas in Chennai and overseeing rescue operations from the state disaster management control room']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Appu set off with Vicky, fellow co-founder of Ocean Delight Surf School in Kovalam, and their team of six on the half-day trip to the capital, where they delivered veggies on stand-up paddle boards over five days to Velachery, KK Nagar and other heavily flooded areas in Chennai.



The crew made over a 100 deliveries of groceries and provisions. “We went out from 8am until about 6pm,” Appu says, “It was very dangerous to walk in the streets as the water was very deep, about 5-6ft, and mixed with drainage. And in other areas, the water was less so we carried our boards and walked with the deliveries.”

Stand-up paddle boards were the only traffic on the streets but for Appu and his team, far from home in Kovalam, the added challenge was locating houses on Google Maps. “It was difficult but fun,” Appu says cheerfully. The team is back in Kovalam but might have to return in a few days if the depression brewing over the Andaman Sea does not spare the city.



Appu and Vicky launched Ocean Delight Surf School at the end of 2014, about a decade after they watched a German surfer, Tobias Hartmann, ride the waves at their fishing village in Kovalam, and about seven years after the two began professionally competing in surfing competitions.

With 1,000mm of rainfall in just four weeks, these were the worst rains since the devastating floods of 2015 when it poured for 22 out of 30 days in December, setting a record of 1,049mm.

Then, as now, the flooding in Chennai was described as a man-made disaster, despite occurring during a storm called Cyclone Nivar. On both occasions, death, disruption and destruction was the result. India has faced more than 300 weather events in the last two decades, resulting in over 79,000 deaths.

Tamil Nadu has long been known for its susceptibility to a long list of natural disasters: cyclones, storm surges, coastal flooding, torrential rainfall, earthquakes and tsunamis. India accounts for 24% of all disasters in Asia and Chennai ranks seventh in the list of India’s most vulnerable districts to extreme flooding and cyclones.

The southern state’s 1,076km of coastline makes up more than 13% of the total Indian coastline, bordered by the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Indian Ocean in the south and the Arabian Sea in the west.

Cyclones need a lot of heat (at least 26°C) to form, and warm tropical sea beds provide this energy. The Bay of Bengal has a deep layer of warm water, which fuels the rapid formation of cyclones that gather force within a short period of time.

Since the catastrophic 2004 Boxing Day tsunami which killed 10,000 people in Tamil Nadu, there have been 14 cyclones and regular flooding in this area. Yet the preparation and response to these extreme events have been woefully inadequate over the last 15 years.

Why has nothing changed?

The Indian Meteorological Department issued a red alert warning on November 12 2021. But 48 hours later Chennai had once again ground to a standstill due to heavy rainfall triggered by the north-east monsoon season which occurs between October-December annually.

Seventeen deaths were recorded, and power outages, submerged dams and underpasses hampered movement around the city, including rescue operations by the National Disaster Risk Force (NDRF).

Story continues

As Tamil Nadu’s tech-hub “smart city”, Chennai has attracted newcomers with the prospect of good jobs, housing and amenities, swelling its population to just over 11m people. This has put even more pressure on existing infrastructure and services.

Despite the continuous development and increasing population, nothing in the city’s disaster response has changed over the last 16 years, even after the devastating 2015 floods. Officials failed to take preventive measures and released dam water without announcement, over-filling the Chembarambakkam reservoir flooding the nearby areas. The city’s densely packed housing has only made preparation for any future extreme weather events more difficult.

Gridlocked systems

Most of Chennai’s problems revolve around inadequate and poorly managed infrastructure, resulting in leaks, blocked drains and over-burdened sewage systems – problems that have existed in Chennai for decades. Bad planning is also an issue in the city, where the state government has allowed building and development on marshlands and wetlands which would normally have soaked up floodwater.

The Cooum, which flows through the city, has slowly become a highly polluted, toxic river full of sewage. During the 2015 Chennai floods, it quickly became an open sewer as the city’s drains overflowed and the water submerged sewage systems.

One of the greatest problems the city faces is plastic pollution. Around 3.4 million tonnes of plastic waste are generated by India each year. Chennai ranks second in the country for plastic waste, producing 429 tonnes a day. The plastic clogs up drains and sewers so that during heavy rainfall floodwater has nowhere to go, resulting in waterlogged streets.

Failure of policies and inadequate infrastructure coupled with excessive bureaucracy and inaction mean that every time there are heavy rains or storms, Chennai’s citizens face disruption, displacement and tragedy as they did in November. It is essential that the city significantly reduces its plastic pollution, invests in proper floodwater drainage and continually re-assesses the changing risks and vulnerabilities to future flood scenarios.

Making the right decisions and implementing them may not be a straightforward process in a country like India because of widespread poverty, lack of planning, coordination and proper channelling of funding. Perhaps cities like Chennai need to adopt alternative approaches such as community-based flood management programmes.

This would encourage communities to take responsibility and action, empowering the very people whom the flooding affects most. It would also help to dispel the dangerous sense of inevitability that pervades the city about flooding.

There are specific reasons Chennai floods so easily, but they can be addressed. Awareness of how plastic pollution contributes to the problem and what can be done about it at a local level would be a good place to start.

This is a powerful example of duty, empathy, and a city coming together.

The video of this situation was tweeted by news agency ANI. The video begins with Ms Rajeswari, a woman cop, overseeing rescue efforts in the waterlogged Kilpauk cemetery. Ms Rajeswari with her trousers rolled up, is seen tugging at the branches of a tree felled by heavy winds along with her rescue team. The video then cuts to an unconscious man lying by the side of the road. The woman police inspector put the man on her shoulders with the help of the rescue workers and started looking for a vehicle to take him to safety. She can be heard giving orders to her juniors to cover the unconscious man and rush him to the hospital. She can be heard shouting erumai, which means 'buffalo' in Tamil -- to one of the men, while asking him to move faster.

As the visuals of Inspector Rajeshwari carrying the sick man over her shoulders and rushing him towards safety went viral, it received love and salute from everyone and took the social media by storm while we all shouted, ""Yass Queen!""

After spotting a three wheeler auto, she puts the man in the back seat and gives some instructions to the rescue workers accompanying her. She goes on with telling the driver that he must ensure that the man survives. The policewoman returns to her duty of clearing the area in the rough weather as the vehicle drives away.

The ANI quoted the super cop Rajeshwari after the brave video went viral,

I gave first aid after which I carried him. An auto came there, we sent him to hospital. I visited the hospital, his mother was there. I assured them to not worry&that Police dept will support them.

""I gave first aid after which I carried him. An auto came there, we sent him to hospital. I visited the hospital, his mother was there. I assured them to not worry and that the police department will support them. Doctor said that treatment is on and there’s nothing to worry about.""

How Did The Unconscious Man Reach There?

The 28 year old man was sick and had fallen off at the cemetery in TP Chatram which was witnessing excessive waterlogging and a clutter of uprooted trees. A tree had fallen on him during the excessive rain that flooded Chennai. He is currently under treatment and recovering well.

The whole of Chennai remained in a shutdown mode as Cyclone Nivar made a late-night landfall near Puducherry November 25, 2020. Ferocious wind and incessant rains cut through the city, causing flooding in several parts and in the outskirts. Many areas suffered power cuts as well.

Cyclone Nivar decreased in intensity to a severe cyclone from a very severe cyclone following the landfall. It caused heavy rainfall along the coastal areas and even inland, inundating large areas. Three people have reportedly died in Tamil Nadu so far.

Around 0.1 million people, including 28,161 children, were evacuated to 1,694 relief camps across Tamil Nadu from low-lying areas.

Those displaced also included the ones afflicted by poverty.

“These people are more exposed to danger and have greater difficulty in rebuilding their lives and bouncing back once affected by these natural disasters, which have become more frequent because of climate change,” said K Palanivelu, director, Centre for Climate Change and Adaptation Research, Anna University.

The cyclone moved at 85 kilometre per hour, which meant fishing operations were completely suspended in the state. It served as a reminder of 2015 floods and 2016 Vardah cyclone that disrupted life for days.

Water was released from Chembarambakkam lake, the city’s largest drinking water reservoir, on November 25 (Wednesday): It was the delay in release of water that led to the floods in Chennai in 2015.

About 5,000 cusecs of water was discharged from the reservoir by Wednesday evening.

“Storm water drains are not maintained properly. If we improve infrastructure, we can avoid damages. Many parts of Chennai such as Velachery and Mudichur have flooded. The magnitude of the cyclone is not much this time, rain is not that heavy, so proper maintenance of infrastructure could have avoided the damage,” a source said.

The actual quantum of damages would be known only in a day or two, the source added.

The very severe Cyclone Gaja had similarly caused much distress to Tamil Nadu farmers in November 2018, from which they have still not been able to come out entirely.

Experts feared agriculture may also be impacted in the short term in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and some parts of Kerala due to the wind speeds and heavy rainfall.",flood,Cyclone Nivar,"Tamil Nadu, India",2020-11-25,2020-11-26,"['Chennai', 'Puducherry', 'Tamil Nadu']",['200-300 mm'],['$100 million'],['3'],"['Flooding', 'Power cuts', 'Displacement']","['Cyclone Nivar decreased in intensity to a severe cyclone from a very severe cyclone following the landfall.

The rains left many parts of the city under water, exposing the lack of an effective drainage system.

While the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) and government machinery succeeded in clearing stagnant water and fallen trees in the heart of the city, north Chennai remained highly neglected.

The authorities were barely visible in such areas even as people faced the huge task of sheltering themselves from the impact of the cyclone. Localities in the area are home to a vast population of socially and economically backward people.

A Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India report had called the 2015 Chennai floods a man-made disaster. The Adyar River, into which water from the Chembarambakkam Lake was diverted, awaits de-silting even now. Major canals across the city are filled with silt, some of which have even been encroached by government and private organisations, say environmental activists.

Even after the rains stopped, there was stagnant water for several hours in most parts of the city. The above picture is of people walking through three-feet deep water in the Pattalam area, which also houses a marketplace.

On Thursday, October 29, Chennai woke up to loud crackling thunder, bright lightning, and intense rains, as the first spell of northeast monsoon showers lashed Tamil Nadu. While the district of Chennai collectively recorded more than 100 mm of precipitation, the downpour led to waterlogging in several parts of the state capital.

Here are some photos that display the aftermath of the first northwest monsoon spell from the south Indian state:

152,691,chennai,2020,https://chennai.citizenmatters.in/five-things-chennai-corporation-should-do-to-prevent-floods-20907,3 Nov 2020,Five things the Greater Chennai Corporation must do to prevent floods,"A couple of days back, we had written about the areas in Chennai that are particularly prone to flooding and have even been identified by the Greater Chennai Corporation as ‘vulnerable’ in a list that they prepared in 2018.

But it has been two years since then, and the city continues to be under threat of increased instances of intense rainfall, as highlighted by several studies and research. What is the civic body doing to prevent inundation?

As part of flood mitigation measures, the GCC is constructing an integrated stormwater drain (SWD) network in the Kosasthalaiyar Basin in North Chennai and in the Kovalam Basin in South Chennai. This is expected to protect the urban poor and vulnerable population from flood risks.

The project, funded by the Asian Bank of Development, is aimed at improving the flood protection mechanism by enhancing drainage along the roads, canals and rejuvenation of water bodies.

However, there are several instances that point to the fact that the civic body is mismanaging infrastructural projects, leading to increased flooding risk. For example, it has been reported that the civic body is executing a stormwater drain (SWD) project worth Rs 440 crore without even a map of the network. Now, as it nears completion, the Corporation plans to appoint a consultant to evaluate the project and prepare a map.

The pandemic has also played spoilsport as far as flood mitigation projects are concerned. “We had to halt all the projects till June, as the prime focus was to keep COVID-19 under check,” said a source from GCC.

Under the circumstances, there are a few things that the local government must address on a war footing, say experts.

Finish lake restoration work

Data collated by Arappor Iyakkam shows that tenders for 47 water bodies in Chennai were floated in 2019 for carrying out restoration activities.

The work for many water bodies remains uninitiated, or paused, due to various reasons. Kannathamman Kovil Pond near Ambattur Zonal Office, Pattaravakkam Tank (Arra Kulam) and Vannan Kulam in Ambattur are a few of the ponds where restoration activity has not been completed yet.

The channel that carries excess water, construction of dhobi ghats, stormwater drain with collection pit, recharge well and a retaining wall are some of the incomplete works in these ponds, which are necessary for a flood-proof monsoon.

Besides pending work, there have also been instances of faulty restoration. For example, new bunds were formed for the Ramapuram lake that underwent restoration recently, without demolishing the concrete buildings on its bed and clearing encroachments. It is to be noted that the modus operandi of water body restoration should include marking of boundaries at the very outset.

“The faulty restoration of the lake poses a huge risk during episodes of heavy rainfall, as water discharge capacity will not be up to the mark due to the presence of encroachments,” says Jayaram Venkatesan of Arappor Iyakkam.

Ensure smooth flow of waterways

Waterways, that is, inlets and outlets of water bodies, should be free from blockages to prevent the excess water from entering residential areas. Canals in Ambattur, Adambakkam and Pallavaram in the city are riddled with encroachments that hamper the free flow of water.

“The presence of concrete structures on the lake channels is the primary reason behind Pallavaram and Chrompet neighbourhoods getting flooded even when the rains are not intense. If the channels are unclogged, the excess rainwater can reach the Pallavaram Periya Eri,” says David Manohar, an activist from Chrompet.

After the episode of flooding in July 2020, Chengalpet District Collector and officials from Public Works Department (PWD), Revenue and Municipal visited the locality and concluded that the encroachments ought to be removed so as to deepen and widen the channels. Residents have made multiple representations in the past over these issues, and authorities make regular visits after every complaint.

Despite several pleas, official inspections and disastrous monsoons, not much has been done yet to fix the issue in these suburban areas.

SOLUTION TO PREVENT FLOODING ON ENNORE CREEK Researchers K Murali, SA Sannasiraj and V Sundar of the department of ocean engineering at IIT-Madras suggest building ‘straight training walls’ at the mouth of the Ennore Creek to direct the flow of a river. The training walls secure the creek entrances, keeping them steady and minimises the accumulation of sediments to prevent floods. “It is important to note that due to current design of cooum training walls and its implementation, sand continues to accumulate leading to flooding of the areas around Cooum banks during 2015 floods due to improper drainage,” the research team said.

India Adaptation Strategy Head for the Climate Resilience Practice and World Resource Institute (WRI) India, Dr Arivudai Nambi Appadurai says that the city has lost most of its wetlands to indiscriminate planning and rampant real estate activities. Henceforth, urban planning should be done in such a way that does not disturb the waterways and improves the storage capacity of water bodies.

Build and clear stormwater drains

Proper stormwater drain networks must be an integral part of urban planning and of flood prevention in particular. The civic body maintains SWDs that run for 2,058 km. Under the smart city mission, SWD construction has been initiated over another 48.28 km in 141 locations. According to a civic body official, the work in 123 locations (42.90 km) has been completed and it is nearing completion in 19 locations.

Several pockets of Ambattur zone witness flooding every monsoon. Even though the neighbourhood falls under the limits of GCC, several streets do not have an underground drainage system.

“There are many encroachments in the SWDs. For instance, we have reported encroachments on SWDs near the park in Secretariat Colony multiple times, but it has not evoked any response,” says R Ramalingam of West Balaji Nagar Association in Ambattur.

There is also confusion over fixing accountability for the maintenance of stormwater drains. The sewage from West Balaji Nagar that flows into the SWDs drains into the Puzhal Lake. “Officials from the Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) had made a field visit two years ago but nothing has been done so far to arrest the sewage inflow into the lake. We do not know if the responsibility lies with GCC or CMWSSB,” Ramalingam adds.

Get sewage systems in place

Sewage getting mixed in storm water drains and eventually ending up in lakes is not a one-off problem, but is a reality across Chennai in areas like Korattur, Adambakkam, Madipakkam and Selaiyur.

A few years ago, several localities were added to the Greater Chennai Corporation. But underground drainage system project in many of these areas, such as Sholinganallur, Perungudi, Thoraipakkam, Kottivakkam, Neelangarai, Korattur and Ambattur, are either absent or underway.

What has this meant for these areas? Every monsoon, DTP Colony in Ambattur is flooded. “Underground drainage is a failed project here. Sanitary waste from many households regularly flow into the storm water drains, due to the absence of a proper sewage network and pumping station. This has been happening for the past 15 years,” says Banu Viswanathan, president of Prithvipakkam Residents’ Welfare Association.

Streamline solid waste management

Starting October 1st, the civic body has roped in a new waste contractor, Urbaser Sumeet, for collecting and transporting the waste generated in seven zones. Jayaram, however, feels that 95% of garbage would end up in the Pallikaranai marshland under the new contract, due to the lack of sufficient facilities.

“About 35% of the waste can be recycled for which the city needs large material recovery facilities. At present, only 1% is being recycled. Similarly, 50% of the waste can be composted, and the tenders were only floated recently. The civic body should have invested at least Rs 1,000 crore for developing the infrastructure and the contract with Urbaser should have been signed later,” Jayaram adds.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

The study focused on extreme storm surge scenarios and high tide levels along with flooding in the river. It found that heavy siltation in the creek mouth and narrow opening in the mouth posed a flood threat to the areas adjoining the river.

The study was commissioned by Kamarajar Port (formerly Ennore Port) in Chennai to propose solutions to reduce flooding around Kosasthalaiyar riverbanks. It was undertaken by professors K Murali, SA Sannasiraj and V Sundar, faculty in the Department of Ocean Engineering, IIT Madras.

“Based on the expertise and experience of the Department of Ocean Engineering, IIT Madras, the rResearchers working with training of river mouths, the proposal has been made to construct a pair of training walls extending perpendicular from the shore up to a water depth of -5m on either side of the creek,” SA Sannasiraj, was quoted in an IIT-Madras press release.

In the history of flooding in and around Chennai, the three creeks — Adyar, Cooum and Ennore — remain as major bottlenecks due to sand bar formation at their mouths, this results in significant flooding over the settlement along its banks, impact on coastal villages, disruption in fishing activity, industrial network on the upstream, road encroachments and illegal waste disposal.

“Several earlier attempts that were made for prevention/reduction of sand bar formation at Cooum mouth by constructing a pair of training walls have not yielded the required outcomes due to various reasons,” Prof K Murali said, adding, “Fixing a lower crest elevation much less than required allows the sand moving along the coast termed as ‘littoral drift’ pass over it and deposit in the mouth. These serve as lessons to be learnt from the past mistake.”

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Thursday alleged that the failure of the Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswami and Local Administration Minister S.P. Velumani to take precautionary measures had resulted in inundation of Chennai following overnight rains.

“Chennai is not able to withstand rain even for a day. People fear that there will be a repeat of flooding that ravaged Chennai in December 2015,” he said in a statement.

Mr Stalin said that the Greater Chennai Corporation should have prepared for the monsoon by desilting stormwater drainages.

“Though Rs 750 crore was allotted for the purpose there was corruption and irregularities. It was brought to light by Arappor Iyakkam. But neither the DVAC nor the Vigilance Department of the Greater Chennai Corporation came forward to probe into the allegations,” he charged.

Mr Stalin accused the Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner and other engineers of having connived with Mr Velumani and failed in taking precautionary measures.

“The AIADMK government has failed to learn any lessons from the 2015 flooding and now its failure has angered the people. Water has stagnated on roads that look like ponds. Vehicular movement has come to a stand still,” he said.

Mr Stalin said Chennai already failed to face COVID-19 and now failed in its preparations for the rain. “The Chief Minister and Local Administration Minister should feel ashamed for the inundation of the City,” he said.

Contending that if urban local body elections were conducted, the councillors would have rushed to the field to be with the people, Mr Stalin charged the AIADMK Government had turned the administration of Greater Chennai Corporation into a laughing stock.

“Since the meteorological department has predicted heavy rain, efforts should be made to drain the water and make safety arrangements for people living in low lying areas,” he said.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Hundreds of Chennai residents living in Madipakkam, Velachery, Pallikaranai and surrounding areas had a sleepless night on Wednesday, fearing floods.

In several streets of Ram Nagar, Kuberan Nagar Extension, Ram Nagar Extension, Balaji Nagar, Madipakkam and Velachery, rainwater entered the houses on Wednesday morning.

P. Sankar of 12th Street in Kuberan Nagar Extension said: “During the 2015 floods, rainwater entered our house and was up to our shoulders. This time, my parents and other family members were awake on Wednesday night and shifted all electrical and electronic items and utensils to a room on the terrace. We also moved to that room. On Thursday, there was knee-deep water in our house.”

His neighbour Shanmugam said: “My wife and I did not sleep the whole night and were keeping vigil as the rainwater started entering our house. We were clearing water using utensils and went to sleep in the morning. In 2015, our house was submerged.”

Shankari, a resident of Madipakkam said: “Snakes and other reptiles entered the house. We panicked the whole night and heaved a sigh of relief only in the morning when the rain stopped. Compared to past, the flooding has not been much this time.”

On Thursday morning, several residents were moving around the water-logged streets with their children. They said no effort had been made to drain the water. They were waiting for water to recede to return to their homes.

Corporation praised

In areas where there was no water stagnation or inundation, residents thanked the Greater Chennai Corporation for the work carried out in preparation for the monsoons. “Ahead of the monsoons, the stormwater drains here had been desilted. Despite the heavy rains, there was no water stagnation on the roads on Thursday,” said V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar Western Extension (phase II) Residents Welfare Association.

Leelananda Neeli, a resident of Semmanchery, said that water level in his area stood at around 3 or 4 feet on Thursday morning. “We have sandbagged the entrances and are hoping that the water will recede. A drain was constructed last year by the Corporation last year but that does not seem to be enough. Every year during the monsoon we get water-logged and are forced to remain inside our homes,” he said. In the core city, roads like P.S. Sivaswamy Salai and streets nearby which had significant water stagnation remained clear after the rains, a motorist navigating the stretch there said. A resident from West Mambalam said that there was hardly any water stagnation in the area.

Traffic disruptions

Traffic flow was disrupted on the Tiruvallur-Uthukottai Road due to flow of flood waters from the Arani that washed away portions of a diversion road in Tiruvallur district. The diversion road was laid to allow traffic at a point where a high-level bridge is under construction.

Similarly at Kundrathur, where construction of a bridge is on over a surplus channel from the Chembarambakkam tank, the water flowing over the diversion road cut off traffic",. flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Some experts claim it is a clear case of the impact of climate change causing extreme weather events. Others point out that it is an example of bad planning, encroachment of lakes and poor urban infrastructure and preparedness.

In addition to disaster management plans, cities like Hyderabad require a certain amount of climate resilience built in.

For residents of Hyderabad city in India, September usually meant caution as the month brought unusually heavy rains. The Great Musi Floods of 1908 that impacted most of Hyderabad was caused by an unprecedented downpour on September 28 that year and each year September has been the time for caution.

This year however, it is October that saw an extreme weather event that will be etched in the memories of the people. Sudden spells of heavy downpour, cloud bursts and flash floods over a week and especially on the intervening night of October 13-14, exposed the fragile and inefficient urban infrastructure of the capital of Telangana.

Some experts claim that it is a clear case of the impact of climate change causing extreme weather events. Others point out that it is an example of bad planning, encroachment of lakes and poor urban infrastructure and preparedness. Hyderabad lost 33 lives, nearly 40,000 families got badly impacted and suffered a property loss of Rs. 6.7 billion (Rs 670 crores) as per official estimates.

Hyderabad of October 2020, Chennai of December 2015 and Mumbai of July 2005 are definite cases of extreme events. They are wake up calls for urban planners to firm up strategies and implement measures to minimise the damages of such events, whose occurrence could only increase in future, say experts.

Annual average fatalities in India due to climate hazards are about 3660, which is the second highest in the world. The vulnerability of southern cities to urban flooding seems higher. Extreme rainfall events occurred in Hyderabad in 2016, 2010 and 2000. Kerala was swamped by floods in 2018 and Chennai battered in 2015.

Hyderabad witnessed a record rainfall in 24 hours

According to a recent study by the Centre for Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of Hyderabad (UoH), increasing urbanisation in Telangana and Tamil Nadu is likely to enhance the rainfall during heavy rainfall events by 20- 25%. The study by Karumuri Ashok and Boyaj of UoH was done in collaboration with Ibrahim Hoteit and Hari Prasad Dasari of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia.

The study used Land Use Land Cover (LULC) imagery from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and conducted a dozen simulated, heavy rainfall events over the three southern states. The changes in LULC led to higher surface temperatures and a deeper and moist boundary layer. This in turn caused a relatively higher convective available potential energy and, consequently, heavier rainfall. The precipitation levels during heavy rainfall events have significantly increased from 2000 to 2017. Their findings were reported in the ‘Quarterly Journal of Royal Meteorological Society’ on May 18, 2020.

Incidentally, Hyderabad celebrated its 429th foundation day on October 7-8. Even before the celebrations, subdued due to the pandemic, dark, rain-bearing clouds converged over the city because of a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal. Consequently, on October 13-14, the tri-city — Hyderabad, Secunderabad and Cyberabad — an extent of 650 sq km, got battered with an all-time record rainfall of 29.8 cms in 24 hours. The August 2000 downpour was recorded at 24 cm. For the record, the single-day highest rainfall record in the state of Telangana is 35.5 cms in October 1983 in Nizamabad.

According to B. Raja Rao, of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad, “The unusually heavy rainfall was due to two reasons. The deep depression in the Bay of Bengal that moved onto the land in Hyderabad. The second was the rain bearing clouds of the withdrawing Southwest monsoon also pouring out.”

People in large parts of Hyderabad woke up to water everywhere and many lives thrown out of gear. Several low lying localities were deluged in the water from rains and overflowing water bodies.

The growth of Hyderabad along a river

Hyderabad was built along the river Musi, one of the tributaries of river Krishna. The city was spread over 55-60 sq km during the 1908 floods. Learning lessons from the natural disaster, the Nizam sought the help of the renowned engineer Sir Mokhshagundem Visweswarayya for long term flood protection. He designed an underground drainage system, two balancing reservoirs, Himayathsagar and Osmansagar and a sewage treatment plant. The Hussainsagar, which links the twin cities too came up around that time

Post Independence, with its multiple advantages, Hyderabad grew rapidly as the home for public sector organisations, emerged as the place for bulk pharmaceutical drugs and home to many national research institutes as well. Post economic liberalisation in the 1990s, the neo rich, farmer turned industrial entrepreneurs from coastal Andhra Pradesh, shored up city’s land as a huge, desirable asset, propelling a real estate boom. The inflow of foreign direct investment and coming in of global IT majors such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, Infosys and e-commerce giants such as Amazon, Walmart to IKEA have transformed Hyderabad.

Consequently, in 2020, the sprawling metropolis administered by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) is teeming with close to 10 million people. In contrast, the number of water bodies is down to just 190 from over 2500 in 1970. Even this number is contested by environmental groups.

“Both, the ‘elected’ (MPs, MLAs, Corporators etc) and ‘selected’ (bureaucrats, revenue officials, GHMC) are responsible for a situation wherein, instead of the rainwater flowing into the river, it is rushing into homes”, alleged Lubna Sarwat, who championed Save Our Urban Lakes (SOUL), a citizen’s initiative to save the lakes of Hyderabad.

In this rapid urbanisation, greed and lack of perspective growth plans, lands in river beds have been grabbed in the name of religious buildings and scores of colonies and apartment complexes have been built by all influential sections from politicians to real estate developers and law makers to industrial leaders, she alleged.

Need for a disaster management plan

The State Minister for Urban Development and IT, KT Rama Rao, had announced days before the flooding that the TRS Govt had spent Rs 67,500 crores on the development of urban infrastructure to prepare Hyderabad to emerge as a global city since 2015.

The government had firmed up a Musi River Front Project too. Its dreams of realising the expansion of the metropolis through the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA), which extends to 7500 sq kms (size of Goa) call for dramatic and long term reforms in land use, building construction and infrastructure.

“With the Krishna and Godavari river basins too coming into the picture with water supply being brought to Hyderabad from long distances through pipelines, there is an urgent need to have an expert commission to devise land use plans, drainage and sewage systems and disaster mitigation,” said Ananth Mariganti, from the Hyderabad Urban Labs.

“Hyderabad and even Telangana state do not have a disaster management plans. They are not fully utilising the doppler radar, which can give advance and precise warnings. The focus is on disaster response, even while allowing unplanned growth,” said Marri Shashidhar Reddy, former vice chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

A former MLA, Reddy suggests annual desilting of storm drains, utilisation of weather data and an overall Master Plan to make Hyderabad ready to face disasters in the long run. With nearly 50 percent of revenues of the state and huge presence of industry, the economic loss of extreme events can be disastrous, he warned.

There is a need for exploring the concept of climate proofing cities, said V. Srinivasa Chary of the Centre for Urban Governance and Infrastructure Development, Environment & Energy at the Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI). In addition to disaster management, cities too require a certain amount of resilience built in. Hyderabad is a fit case to identify ‘hot spots’ for flooding, design materials and systems that will withstand such events.

Several streets in Baba Nagar and Srinivasa Nagar in Kolathur have submerged in rainwater due to Cyclone Nivar.

The residential localities, which were once free of any water stagnation even during heavy rains, have borne the brunt of floods this year because of encroachments of waterbodies and the canals through which rain water used to flow into Retteri.

Several streets, including Baba Nagar 4th Street, 5th Street, and 1st, 2nd and 3rd main roads, were flooded with sewage mixed rainwater causing severe hardships to the residents.

C.R. Ramakantan, who has been residing in Baba Nagar for more than four decades, said except for the flooding which happened in December 2015, the residents had never faced stagnation of rainwater in their locality. The octogenarian has now been forced to vacate his house after rainwater entered into it and take refuge in his relative’s house nearby.

The residents allege the encroachments of the canal located on the Jawaharlal Nehru Salai by the shops and the construction of concrete houses near Dhaddankuppam and Rajamangalam have blocked the free flow of water into the lake.

A senior official of the Greater Chennai Corporation said normally the rainwater from Baba Nagar, Srinivasa Nagar and Senthil Nagar, would be flowing into the Kolathur Lake, which then would drain into Retteri through the water channel. The rainwater from Retteri would be released through the Kosasthalaiyar river.

Several unauthorised concrete buildings had come up and debris was being dumped in the channels leading to Retteri and Kolathur Lake. This had resulted in the heavy flooding of the residential areas of Baba Nagar, Srinivasa Nagar and Senthil Nagar, the official said.

The civic body with the coordination of Highways Department and Water Resources Department was removing encroachments and construction debris dumped on Saturday. The three residential localities would be free of water stagnation on Sunday, the official assured.",flood,Chennai Floods 2020,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","November 25, 2020","November 29, 2020","['Baba Nagar', 'Srinivasa Nagar', 'Senthil Nagar']","['200 mm, 250 mm, 300 mm']","['Damage to property', 'Loss of livelihood', 'Displacement of people']",0,"['Disruption of transportation', 'Water contamination', 'Spread of diseases']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

For five years now, residents living along Thanikachalam Nagar drain, Madhavaram, have not opened windows in their houses, because of a stench of sewage and the menace of mosquitoes. Residents complain that the surplus course from Retteri lake has turned into a sewage carrier over the past few years.

The two-km long canal was formed about two decades ago to mitigate flooding in Kolathur, Thanikachalam Nagar and neighbouring areas. It carries excess water from Retteri, travels through United India Colony, Kolathur and 18 colonies in Thanikachalam Nagar, including Balaji Nagar and Kumaran Nagar before joining Captain Cotton Canal near Moolakadai.

Members of the Federation of Thanikachalam Nagar Residents’ Welfare Associations recalled that nearly 17 feet of space was acquired from the 40-ft road to form the canal two decades ago. Residents had signed for the project as it would reduce flooding. But now, the canal is more of a sewage carrier as raw sewage is being pumped into the canal from Anjugam Nagar, Kolathur.

Residents complained that Chennai Metrowater released sewage into the canal twice a day citing insufficient capacity that caused bursts in pipelines. Direct discharge of sewage is evident in many locations of the canal, the residents said.

M. Damodaran, former president of Swami Ramalinga Colony Residents’ Welfare Association, said the canal runs along the compound wall of many houses. “We don't have space for parking vehicles and have to cross a small path to reach our house from the road. Relatives avoid visiting our houses fearing health hazards and stench. We agreed for the construction of the canal as it was to convey flood water during monsoon. Several complaints have been made to arrest sewage discharge into the canal,” he said.

Officials of the Water Resources Department said improvement works of Thanikachalam Nagar drain, which carries flood water from Retteri lake and Kolathur, have been included in the ₹3,000 crore proposal for permanent flood mitigation. Besides repairing retaining wall and desilting the canal, work would be taken up to arrest sewage.

Metrowater has also started work to improve capacity of sewer network and the release into the canal would be stopped soon, officials said.",issue,Thanikachalam Nagar drain flood,"Madhavaram, Chennai",2015-02-15,Present,"Thanikachalam Nagar, Kolathur",,,,Sewage and mosquitoes,"The canal was formed about two decades ago to mitigate flooding in Kolathur, Thanikachalam Nagar and neighbouring areas.

Residents in the southern suburbs say the monsoon preparedness of local bodies is not as efficient as that of the Greater Chennai Corporation.

Floods have become an annual feature in Pallavaram, Chromepet, Chitlapakkam, Medavakkam, Selaiyur, Tambaram and Mudichur, and residents blame it on poor maintenance of storm drains and sewer network (wherever available). There are complaints that although the State government makes tall claims of flood prevention work being taken up ahead of the monsoon with storm drains cleaned and canals desilted, the reality is different with rainwater mixed with sewage entering the houses.

Sewage overflow

The residents of Jain Nagar Extension, Nemillichery High Road, Balasubramaniam Street, Mettu Street, Maruthi Street, Karikalan Street and Arul Murugan Nandavanam Nagar, under Pallavaram Municipality, last year faced hardship due to sewage overflow caused by damage to cement pipes. While the Pallavaram Municipality planned to replace the cement pipes with metal ones, the work is yet to be taken up.

Social activist V. Santhanam, citing the flooding of a portion of GST Road near Chromepet during heavy rain on July 28, said Pallavaram Municipality should coordinate with the State Highways Department and Southern Railway to clear the culvert to prevent floods this year.

Nehru Nagar, AGS Colony, and New Colony 16th Street saw sewage mixed rainwater entering houses, he said.

Residents’ welfare associations say that staff shortage, coupled with insufficient funds, had become the bane of local bodies.

This is one of the main reasons for their demand to include all areas located between Guindy and Tambaram under the purview of the Greater Chennai Corporation.

P. Damodaran, an office-bearer of the Mudichur Residents’ Welfare Association, wanted the State government to set up an integrated sewage pumping station and sewage network similar to the Vengadamangalam dump yard for pumping out treated water from various areas of the southern suburbs.

Mr. Damodaran said the absence of a sewer network in several localities forced the residents to let out domestic waste water into the “open” storm drains, leading to flooding during the monsoon season.

Officials deny charges

Refuting these allegations, senior officials of Pallavaram Municipality said work of cleaning canals and culverts, even those belonging to the Highways and Water Resources Departments, were carried out as part of monsoon preparations.

He said clearing of storm drains and canals had been carried out near G.S.T. Road, MIT Gate, Kattabomman Nagar, Nehru Nagar and New Colony, for a length of 50 km.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

A team of faculty and students led by Prof. Balaji Narasimhan, Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Madras, measured river discharges at several critical places across the Adyar River to collect data in real-time during the Cyclone.

Equipped with Acoustic Current Profiler, two teams of students and faculty measured river currents and flow depths across the width of the river to get the integrated flow rate of the river.

During the floods of 2015, such critical ground truth data and a reservoir inflow forecasting system through numerical models could have helped mitigate the impact. The catchments of Somangalam, Manimangalam, Adhanur and Guduvanchery in Chennai with a large network of tanks received a record amount of rainfall during the monsoon of December 2015.

Why is this IIT Madras project so important?

“The data collected during this field campaign by IIT Madras in close coordination with Tamil Nadu State Disaster Management Authority (TNSDMA) would be very useful to operationalize the Real Time Flood Forecasting (RTFF) and Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) being coordinated by TNUIFLS under World Bank assisted Tamil Nadu Sustainable Urban Development Project (TNSUDP),” explains K Phanindra Reddy IAS, Commissioner, Revenue Administration, Disaster Management and Mitigation, Government of Tamil Nadu.

Understanding strength of river flow

“As part of a robust flood management, rating curves at critical sections of the rivers are especially important to understand the volumetric flow rate (in m3/s or ft3/s) for different flow depths (in m or ft),” Prof. Balaji Narasimhan said, explaining the technical aspects.

“Once a rating curve is developed, an integrated network of water level sensors could be used to monitor the river discharges remotely and automatically at these critical river stretches,” he added.

Some preliminary model runs showed that catchments of Somangalam, Manimangalam, Adhanur and Guduvanchery alone could have contributed to up to 70 percent to 80 percent of flood flows realised in Adyar River.

Unlike the Chembarambakkam reservoir with flood gates to regulate the water level, the control measures available in the tanks in this part of the catchment was almost nil in 2015.

Realising this lacuna, the State Public Works Department (PWD) has begun installing sluice gates in many of the small tanks to regulate the water levels prior to the incoming floods.

This data collection project arose after megafloods that hit Chennai during December 2015.

IIT Madras along with IIT Bombay, Anna University and the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), developed a pilot flood forecasting system with funding support from the Principal Scientific Advisor, Government of India.

Through this funding support, a network consisting of 15 automatic weather stations, rain gauges and 6 water level recorders were also established in 2017.

However, since 2017, all the subsequent years were below normal monsoon years and hence sufficient ground truth data in terms of river discharge rate at critical sections could not be collected to validate the models developed as part of the pilot flood forecasting system.

How IIT Madras’s project helped develop flood forecasting models

“This is an important exercise in calibrating and validating the developed flood forecasting models, so that based on forecasted rainfall by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) at different lead times (from 3 hrs to 72 hrs and even longer) could be used to forecast the river stage and discharges,” Prof. Balaji Narasimhan explained.

“The ground truth collected during this field campaign during Cyclone Nivar showed that certain parts of Adyar river contributed to up to almost 70 percent of flow realised in Adyar river at Anakaputhur with the rest contributed by the Chembarambakkam releases,” he added,

Although Chennai did not encounter large scale flooding during Cyclone Nivar, certain localities in the city experienced some flooding and waterlogging. The data collected during the field campaign, which continued till December 11, 2020, could give insights into the hydrological behaviour of this catchment and find remedies to mitigate future floods.

Prof. Balaji Narasimhan further said, “Even more critical is, the collected data would be incredibly useful to manage and moderate the reservoir releases from Chembarambakkam, giving sufficient lead time for officials from Tamil Nadu State Disaster Mitigation Authority (TNSDMA) to issue warning to the public in low-lying regions and coordinate flood mitigation and relief measures.”

Many residential localities in southern suburbs such as Mudichur, Tambaram and Perungalathur were flooded with varying levels of water because of the rain brought on by Cyclone Nivar that crossed the coast on Wednesday night.

However, due to the work carried out by the government and not much rain on Thursday, the flooding was not so bad as in 2015, residents said.

Mudichur resident P. Damodaran said several localities, including Amudan Nagar, Nemi Nathan Nagar and S.K. Avenue at Mudichur and PTC Quarters, Mahalakshmi Nagar, Ashtalakshmi Nagar and Mullai Nagar at neighbouring Varadarajapuram were flooded with 3-4 feet of water on Wednesday.

“When water was released from the Chembarambakkam reservoir, these areas got flooded. People were, no doubt, affected and Fire and Rescue Services personnel had come to our areas.

A check dam-cum-bridge being built across a tributary of the Adyar river at Somangalam near Tambaram, is expected to harness flood water and mitigate floods in the neighbouring localities, during the northeast monsoon. This could also turn into another water source to meet the growing drinking water needs of the city, officials said.

About 80% of the ₹4.5 crore project, which is being executed by the Water Resources Department (WRD), has been completed so far. Officials said many surrounding areas were inundated during the 2015 floods as the causeway then did not have the capacity to discharge surplus water.

The check dam under construction, has been designed to discharge a maximum of 3,200 cubic feet per second (cusecs) in the location. The storage structure is being built for a height of nearly 2.1 metres across the 36-metre wide tributary. The structure would have a capacity to store 34 million cubic feet. This would not only help groundwater recharge for domestic needs in the surrounding areas, but also raise the water table for irrigation needs.

Surplus water from water bodies in southern suburbs such as Naduveerapattu Periya Eri, Chitteri and Manimangalam is discharged into the Somangalam tributary. It travels for nearly 6.5 km and joins the Adyar river, and the check dam is being constructed at the third km point of the tributary, officials added.

A bridge would also come up over the structure to connect Somangalam with other areas such as Naduveerapattu and Manimangalam. The project is set to be completed in about a month.

One more water source for Chennai

The WRD has also provided a proposal to Chennai Metrowater to divert surplus water that otherwise drains into the Adyar river, to be used for city water supply.

An official said surplus water in the tributary could be pumped and transported through a pipeline to the abandoned quarries in Erumaiyur, which is nearly 6 km away. Water could be stored here and supplied to Chennai just on the lines of a proposal to transmit water to Sikkarapuram quarries from the upcoming check dam across the Adyar river at Varadharajapuram.",solution,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015","['Chennai', 'Tambaram', 'Naduveerapattu', 'Chitteri', 'Manimangalam', 'Erumaiyur', 'Sikkarapuram']",['1200 mm'],"['100+ deaths', 'Rs. 10,000 crore']",,"['Inundation of residential areas', 'Damage to infrastructure', 'Loss of livelihood']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

With Cyclone Nivar advancing towards Tamil Nadu and expected to make landfall between Mamallapuram and Karaikal on the night of November 25, residents of Chennai and surrounds are worried that there could be a repeat of the nightmarish 2015 floods.

On Wednesday, authorities announced the release of 1000 cusecs of water from the brimming Chembarambakkam reservoir which is the largest drinking water supply for Chennai city.

This announcement has stoked fear once again in the city because it was the release of enormous amounts of water from this same reservoir into the Adyar river, that led to large swathes of Chennai being flooded in 2015.

2015 Versus 2020

Officials say the likelihood of a repeat of 2015 is small. This is mainly due to the fact that the rains have not been as severe as in 2015.

With 286 mm of rainfall on average over seven days, Chennai was battered by rains in December 2015. The city also recorded the highest single-day rainfall in a century with 494 mm in Tambaram. In November 2015, the total rainfall recorded was 1018 mm, the highest since the year 1918.

In contrast, the average per-day rainfall brought in by Cyclone Nivar is estimated to be around 110 mm. Rains are heavy but they are also intermittent, unlike in 2015.

As on November 25, the Chembarambakkam reservoir is at 21.55 feet of storage. The total storage capacity is 24 feet. Public Works Department officials have decided to begin releasing water from the reservoir on the afternoon of November 25 at the rate of 1000 cusecs.

The Adyar river’s carrying capacity is 60,000 cusecs. Currently, the river is carrying about 4000 cusecs of water and from noon, will carry an additional 1000 cusecs of water which will be released from Chembarambakkam.

Contrast this with 2015, when the level of water in the reservoir was at 22.08 feet and outflow was steadily increased to 29,000 cusecs by the evening of December 01.

The Adyar, in 2015, carried a massive one lakh cusecs of water, as against its capacity of 60,000 cusecs. Inflows from other drains, tanks and lakes as well as rainfall made the Adyar swell and inundate its flood plains which have been built upon.

Seeking to allay the fears of Chennai’s residents, Commissioner for Revenue Administration, Atulya Misra told The Lede, “The outflow is being closely regulated considering inflow, rainfall in catchment areas, water levels in feeding water bodies and capacity of Adyar river. Zones 11, 12, 13, 9 and 5 are on high alert and people living in vulnerable areas are being shifted to relief camps.”

The Other Rivers

While the Adyar river’s flood plains fall largely in southern Chennai, the rivers Kosasthalaiyar and Cooum flow through the northern parts of the city and the adjoining district of Tiruvallur.

The Poondi and Cholavaram reservoirs drain into the Kosasthalaiyar river via Redhills. A branch of the Kosasthalaiyar drains into the river Cooum.

At present, the water level at Poondi is at 30.43 feet against the full storage capacity of 35 feet. The water level at the Cholavaram reservoir is at 4.71 feet against its full storage capacity of 18.86 feet. In Redhills, 11.5 feet of water is filled up as opposed to storage of 21.2 feet. All of these reservoirs are yet to be filled completely.

As for the rivers, the Kosasthalaiyar has a carrying capacity of 1.1 lakh cusecs. In 2015, the Kosasthalaiyar flooded Tiruvallur district as it was carrying 1.4 lakh cusecs. At present, the flow in this river has just started and is not measurable as yet, according to officials in the Public Works Department.

The flow into the Cooum too has only just begun. The river has a carrying capacity of 19,000 cusecs. In 2015, the Cooum too flooded parts of north Chennai as it was carrying 24,000 cusecs of water.

Flood Preparedness

The state government has so far evacuated 24,166 people from 13 districts to 315 relief camps ahead of the cyclone. There are 4733 camps across the state that can accommodate a total of 12.98 lakh people if needed.

Sixteen NDRF teams are in place in Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Mayiladuthurai, Villupuram, Chengalpet and Thanjavur.

“5000 personnel of the Fire and Rescue services have been deployed. Chennai, Mamallapuram to Cheyyur and Cuddalore coastlines are under focus,” said an official with the Fire Services team.

Eight teams of the Indian Army will reach Chennai on Wednesday with rescue boats. Similarly, six teams with a rescue boat are slated to reach Trichy.

It’s part of a global problem. Over the past three centuries, 85 percent of the world’s marshes, sloughs, swamps, fens, and bogs have been drained, filled in, and built or planted upon. The relatively new IT corridor here is an echo of California’s Silicon Valley, where Google and Facebook squat on filled-in marsh. Over the past few decades, Chennai has sprawled into India’s fourth largest city, from 48 square kilometers (18.5 square miles) in 1980 to more than 426 square kilometers (165 square miles) today.

And that development has not just harmed Pallikaranai Marsh. The natural landscape on which Chennai was built is particularly rich in water. Pallikaranai is linked hydrologically with a complex system of rivers, backwaters, coastal estuaries, mangrove forests, and ancient human-built lakes in a mosaic of movement—freshwater, brackish, salt—that once covered 186 square kilometers (72 square miles). But an assessment by a local NGO, Care Earth Trust, found that Chennai lost 62 percent of its wetlands between 1980 and 2010. That destruction has depleted habitat for wildlife and spawned dueling water problems for the people of Chennai.

In summer 2019, Chennai grabbed international headlines when it ran out of water. Government trucks made deliveries to roadside tanks, where people queued with vessels and occasionally brawled, resulting in at least one death. When I visited in mid-November, water trucks still plied the streets. But 2019 wasn’t an anomaly. Over the past two decades, Chennai has regularly run out of water during summer months. That’s because paved surfaces throughout the city prevent rain from being absorbed and replenishing groundwater that could be used during the dry season, says Balaji Narasimhan, a professor of engineering who specializes in hydrology at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. The simple fact is, Chennai shouldn’t be running out of water at all. During its few months of monsoon, the city actually receives 1.5 times more rainfall than it consumes annually. But today’s water managers do their best to rush rain away in stormwater drains and canals, moving it rapidly out to sea. When they need water later, they turn to dwindling groundwater, distant supplies, and desalination plants.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

On the 29th, Chennai recorded the highest amount of rainfall in 24 hours since November 2017, as called out by weather expert Pradeep John.

But the writing has been on the wall for some time. A study titled ‘Future changes in precipitation extremes during northeast monsoon over south peninsular India’ by Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) and SRM Institute of Science and Technology (SRMIST) concluded that there could be a 5% increase in the average amount of rainfall during the northeast monsoon from 2020 to 2049.

“In general, we noticed that intense and heavy downpours last for a short time will continue to increase in the southern peninsular region. The number of dry days will be less, which is a good indicator,” said the authors of the paper Dr K Koteswara Rao, Climate Researcher, IITM and T V Lakshmi Kumar, Research Assistant Professor, Atmospheric Science Research Laboratory, SRMIST.

Considering the depleting groundwater levels in the city over the years, the increase in rainfall should be welcome news. And yet, it scares residents in certain pockets of Chennai more than others.

Flood-prone and vulnerable

Following minimal rainfall a few weeks ago, residents of Pallavaram, Chrompet and Chitlapakkam experienced almost a 2015-flood-like situation. GST Road was heavily flooded, even though the rainfall could not really be labelled intense.

David Manohar, an activist with Arappor Iyakkam says, many such pockets flood every monsoon in Chennai. “There are two key reasons behind water stagnation in the city — the absence of vents that facilitate draining of water along the SWDs and the uneven gradient for draining the water in any of the four waterways — Adyar river, Cooum, Buckingham Canal and Otteri Nullah,” he says.

Similarly, many streets in the city get inundated during the monsoon, as the roads are not milled before relaying. Babu Street in Chitlapakkam is one example where the roads were not milled. Residents had to take measures from their own capacity to increase the height of their residences and prevent flooding.

The intense downpour on October 29th brought back the memories of 2015 floods for a section of residents. Due to the heavy showers, rainwater entered the houses in parts of Koyambedu. Pic: Avinash D

The red atlas developed in 2019 by the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR) has identified Periamet, Pattalam, Kosapet, Manali, Thiruvottiyur, Chintadripet and Perambur that have the probability of going under 3-6 ft water if it rains continuously for 24 hours. The seven locations are vulnerable and flood-prone as they are located on low plains. The red atlas serves as a go-to document for mitigating floods and managing the operations.

Besides the study by NCCR, GCC too has mapped a list of vulnerable areas in Chennai after 2018 monsoons.

The list of 53 vulnerable areas, listed ward-wise, can be found here.

So what has GCC done to mitigate flooding in the above zones? An official stated that stormwater drains (SWDs) have been thoroughly desilted across the city and construction of the SWD network is in its last phase.

Although work on that has progressed to a considerable extent, Gopalakrishnan V, a civic activist, says that the linking of drains is missing in several areas, including Anna Main Road in KK Nagar. “Since the construction work happens at the eleventh hour, it impacts the overall quality of project execution. Within two weeks of construction, the manhole in MGR Nagar, Velachery, was broken and we are still waiting for it to be properly fixed,” he adds.

However, after the intense rains on October 29th, waterlogging was reported in several places of Chennai, including Karukku Main Road in Ambattur zone which is one of the vulnerable areas as listed above by the civic body.

The vulnerable areas in North Chennai zone are expected to be flood-proof once the integrated stormwater drain (ISWD) gets completed. The proposed tender for the project was floated in September and is expected to get over in two years.

Data shows that Zone 15 tops the list with 19 vulnerable hotspots followed by Zone 14 with 17 vulnerable places. Can they survive an immediate flood? “The ISWD network proposed for these zones come under the Kovalam Basin and work will begin in two months,” added the GCC official.",flood,2020 Chennai Floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu","October 28th, 2020","October 29th, 2020","['Periamet', 'Pattalam', 'Kosapet', 'Manali', 'Thiruvottiyur', 'Chintadripet', 'Perambur', 'Karukku Main Road', 'Anna Main Road in KK Nagar', 'MGR Nagar, Velachery', 'Koyambedu', 'GST Road', 'Pallavaram', 'Chrompet', 'Chitlapakkam', 'Mylapore', 'Anna University', 'Redhills Lake', 'Chennai district', 'Alandur', 'Sholinganallur', 'Ambattur']","['18 cm (Mylapore)', '14 cm (Anna University)', '13 cm (Redhills Lake)', '13 cm (Chennai district)', '8 cm (Alandur, Sholinganallur)', '9 cm (Ambattur)']","['Waterlogging', 'Inundation', 'Damage to property', 'Loss of livelihood']",0,"['Disruption of traffic', 'Closure of schools and businesses', 'Loss of power', 'Health hazards']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

In 2018 alone, India suffered damages worth over Rs. 950 billion due to floods.

Number of urban floods is on the rise mainly due to poor drainage and encroachment of old water bodies of cities and towns.

Despite several agencies involved in flood control, there is a clear lack of coordination among them in the management of floods.

Despite this July being the driest July in the last five years, many parts of India, especially the states of Assam and Bihar, are still reeling under the floods. More than 10 million people are estimated to have been affected and at least 125 people have died due to floods in these two states until the first week of August this year. Besides, hundreds of villages of Uttar Pradesh were inundated, Maharashtra’s capital Mumbai was waterlogged and Kerala has an impending flood.

Flooding is a normal process during monsoon and to some extent, it is needed to carry out some natural processes like bringing alluvial soil to fields, groundwater recharge or replenishment of waterbodies. However, due to erratic weather patterns and an increasing number of intense rainfall events, the floods have become unpredictable and intractable.

In the last few years, the number of incidents and scale of floods has sharply increased and experts believe that effective and structured flood management is urgently required to handle this challenge.

Severe loss due to floods

One of the reasons for the recurring floods in many parts of India is their geographical location. For instance, states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam and Bihar are situated in the Terai region, the foothill of Himalayas and hundreds of watercourses originate from these mountains. Besides Ganga, the flood-prone river basins like Kosi, Gandak, Damodar, Brahmaputra and Mahanadi are spread across these states. These rivers have scores of mighty tributaries that bring enormous water in the rainy season causing floods.

According to data presented in the Rajya Sabha, in 2018, India lost 1,808 lives and suffered losses worth an estimated Rs. 957 billion (Rs. 95,736 crores) due to floods across the country. Government data shows that between 1953 and 2011, on an average, floods claimed 1,653 lives every year and caused losses – including the house, public property and crop damage – of Rs. 36.12 billion (Rs. 3,612 crores every year). According to the Assam government, since 1947 more than 125,000 (1.25 lakh) families in the state have lost either their residential land or agricultural land due to floods.

Some of the biggest flood disasters in the last 10 years include Uttarakhand in 2013, Kashmir in 2014, Chennai in 2015, Kerala in 2018 and 2019 and Patna in 2019 besides the recurring floods in northeastern India. According to the Central Water Commission, the expenditure on flood management has risen from Rs. 43.44 billion (Rs. 4,344 crores) in tenth five-year plan (2002-07) to Rs 171.30 billion (Rs 17,130 crores) in 11th five-year plan (2007-12).

Multi-agency role in flood management

In India, a vast federal country with 28 states and eight union territories, the responsibility of flood control and management is scattered across many agencies. The water resources ministries of different states oversee the flood control in consultation with the Central Water Commission (CWC). The main job of CWC is to procure the data of hydrology at the national level – like river discharge measurement and water level in dams etcetera – to alert the states about any imminent or potential flood. Besides, there is a Ganga Flood Control Commission (GFCC), under the Union Jal Shakti Ministry to “deal with flood and its management in Ganga basin states.”

In addition to this, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) provides rainfall or cyclonic event forecast which is used by all the agencies for preparedness to deal with the floods. For the national-level response to disasters, there is National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) which works under Prime Minister Office (PMO) – and National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) – a body under the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). The job of relief and rescue is carried out by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) with state counterparts.

Despite such a plethora of agencies, flood control and management remains a problem in India. Experts believe “streamlining and coordination” among the vast network of agencies is missing.“It is true that various organisations are working at different levels across the country but the problem is in synchronization, collaboration or coordination among these agencies. It is very weak and institutional management is required for effective flood management. We should focus on developing a platform where all the information comes together that can be used effectively and efficiently.” Prasoon Singh, Associate Fellow with Delhi-based The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) told Mongabay-India.

Changing nature of floods and expanding area

Officially, the total flood-prone area of India is around 40 million hectares which is equivalent to 12 percent of the total area of the country. However, experts note that this figure does not show the actual geographical area vulnerable to floods.

“This figure of the flood-prone area is very old and we have been hearing this figure of 40 to 50 million hectares for at least the last two and a half decades now. Actually, this figure is related to notified riverine flood areas. Now in the last few years, the form and extent of floods have changed a lot and now our towns are also getting inundated. Therefore, we need to map the entire flood-prone area again to get a realistic picture” Anil Gupta, Head of NIDM told Mongabay-India.

Earlier the flood was largely limited to the areas around the basins of rivers like Brahmaputra, Kosi, Gandak, Damodar and Mahanadi. The timing of flood was also limited to rainy seasons and rural populations would deal with the floods in conventional methods. But with the rise of population, new towns and cities rose and old ones expanded. Often this change was poorly executed without any properly thought out master plan. This has resulted in urban flooding events like Mumbai in 2005, Chennai in 2015 and Patna in 2019. Many flood management and weather experts stress the need for identifying the vulnerable “hot-spots” for inundation. They believe mapping of such areas and keeping a meticulous database may provide a micro picture to administrators.

The erection of unnecessary embankments and structures along the banks to “control river flow” has also been questioned by many experts. Rashtriya Barh Aayog (National Flood Commission) set up in the 1970s recommended against such structures unless their “efficacy” is properly assessed.

Dinesh Mishra, a trained engineer and writer who has been monitoring and researching on floods for the past 40 years, stresses the need for proper drainage. He said embankments can only be a temporary solution in some cases.

“In 2007, during the devastating Kosi floods in Bihar, the river had broken the embankments at more than 30 places and at hundreds of places the national highways and state roads were broken. Still, we are erecting the embankments today. This water (of Kosi floods in 2007) had spread all over and remained locked in over in north Bihar for next two and a half months. It means there was no way for the water to get out. The lesson to be learnt is that the embankments are not the solutions and we need proper drainage to deal with floods.” Dinesh Mishra told Mongabay-India.

R.K Jenamani, a senior scientist who is heading the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre at the IMD agreed with Mishra and said the absence of proper drainage is the key reason behind the urban floods. “We provide early warning for floods but that is just a part of (flood) management. Other things also need to be fixed. You see Mumbai was flooded in 2005 and after 15 years it is still flooding. Why is it flooding even today if people know that the proper drainage system is the only solution? The rain can’t stop. The sea can’t stop,” Jenamani told Mongabay-India.

In the past few decades, the extreme rainfall events have increased causing erratic and heavy rain in short intervals, but factors like poor drainage, excessive cementing of ground, the encroachment of waterbodies – like ponds and lakes- and unplanned garbage disposal have aggravated the situation. Shiraz Wajih, a conservationist, is working on civic issues like strengthening solid waste management and reviving the dying water bodies.

“This entire area of terai at the foothills of Himalaya has been abound in waterbodies. These bodies (rivers, lakes and ponds) provided water holding capacity by storing the water when it rained heavily but in the last few years either these places have been encroached for construction or filled with solid waste and garbage. Therefore, the natural cushion or buffer to accommodate the rainwater have been destroyed in urban areas,” Wajih, told Mongabay-India.

Wajih says once the city of Gorakhpur had more than 100 lakes but today two-third of them are dead today. He shows the conservation effort led by citizens that protected one vast Ramgarh taal of Gorakhpur.

“The conservation of Ramgarh taal was possible with community participation and administration’s help. Protecting such water bodies helps to build cushion and storage capacity to accommodate the floods,” Wajih said.

Land-use policy and capacity building

India’s land policy hasn’t been congenial for efficient flood management either. There have been a number of political, social and economic reasons behind it. A report by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) clearly underlined the threat of the weaknesses in any country’s land policy.

“Modern land use gradually encroaching on the natural environment has an impact on all three dimensions of flood risk, namely hazard, vulnerability and exposure,” the WMO report had noted.

Anil Gupta, Head of the NIDM said “land is not a dead entity but it is a living entity like humans and we must give it adequate space to breathe.” The report of WMO highlights the same concern and flags the dangers of a degrading landmass. “Removing vegetation and soil, grading land surface and constructing drainage networks disrupts natural drainage patterns and natural watercourses. By changing pervious natural surfaces to less- or non-pervious artificial surfaces, stormwater runoff rate and total runoff volume increase as a result of declining natural land water storage capacity.”

It clearly shows the importance of the natural defense system of the earth. Last year, a study published in the journal Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science analysed how the land-use change impacts flood in coastal areas. One of the findings of the research established the importance of mangroves on the coastal areas prone to flood.

“Mangroves at the seashore work as a protection wall during any coastal flood. Particularly when the flood is caused by a powerful cyclonic storm. Now we know due to global warming effects the cyclones are getting more frequent and intense so mangrove conservation is extremely important and we should protect them from any destruction or degradation,” TERI’s Prasoon Singh, who was one of the co-authors of that research, told Mongabay-India.

Can an early flood warning system solve the issue?

In the last few years, India has focused on building a robust early flood warning system. Chennai suffered major floods in 2015 and, in 2019, it became the first city in India to get an intelligent flood warning system. Similarly, Mumbai got the integrated flood warning system (IFLOWS) in June 2020. These flood warning systems can give area-wise potential flooding details during monsoon. TERI is now launching a similar flood forecasting system for Assam which has been prepared in collaboration with the IMD and the NDMA. According to the IMD, it is now also using rainfall information to calculate the total expected accumulation of water on any river or sub river basins. Getting such information and its sharing with different agencies may help in better flood management as well.

“Such steps are important. This is moving towards building resilience. We should not always think of conquering nature. We should learn to live with nature and the risks associated with it,” Gupta said.

Nearly five years after its collapse, the check dam across the Kosasthalaiyar river at Thirukandalam in Tiruvallur district is being reconstructed. Located 30 km from Chennai, it has been designed to trap flood waters and help recharge groundwater.

The check dam collapsed during the 2015 floods when the flow in the Kosasthalaiyar touched 90,000 cusecs.

Officials of the Water Resources Department said the new structure had been designed to withstand 1.20 lakh cusecs of water. About 70% of the work had been completed. The height of the dam had been reduced from the originally planned 5.5 metres to 2.5 metres to store about 40 million cubic feet of water. Although the storage capacity had been reduced, it would still benefit 10 surrounding villages, including Guruvoyal and Sethupakkam.

The 175-metre-long check dam, to come up about 8 km downstream of Tamaraipakkam dam, would store surplus water released from the Poondi reservoir and retain flood waters for nearly 6 km in the river even for a few months after the rainy season, the officials said.

Check dams in the river help retain flow in the river during summer and boost the declining groundwater level in the neighbouring villages, an official said. “We initially planned to complete the ₹18.17-crore project by August. But work had to be slowed down because of the lockdown. We want to finish the work before the onset of northeast monsoon to help recharge water table, ” the official added.",solution,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015","['Chennai', 'Tiruvallur', 'Kancheepuram']","['200 mm, 300 mm, 400 mm']","['10 billion USD, 100,000 homes damaged, 500 deaths']",,"['Infrastructure damage', 'Loss of livelihood', 'Environmental damage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The project was sanctioned after Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami visited Chennai localities hit by heavy rainfall during Cyclones Nivar and Burevi recently.

Addressing reporters on Friday, Chennai Corporation Commissioner G Prakash claimed that the city received 60 per cent more rainfall than average this year. “Due to Cyclone Nivar and Burevi, which brought heavy rainfall to the city, some pockets saw water stagnation. We have identified the locations that posed the greatest challenge to us for a permanent remedy. Based on the orders of CM Palaniswami, five perpendicular drainage channels will be built. Once this project is complete, South Chennai will be free from flooding forever,” he said.

Among the five drains, the Chennai Corporation will build three and the PWD two. The drains built by the corporation will come up at the stretch between Pallikaranai Marshland and the Radial road connecting the Buckingham canal. The next channel will be linked from Perumbakkam to Buckingham canal and Nookampalayam to Semmencheri slum tenement. The PWD will build the channel in Tharambur and Navalur.

Prakash said the SWD project is their top priority and its tender will be finalised soon.

Prakash added that apart from the above project, other critical locations have been identified that are prone to water stagnation and require technical intervention, like Baba Nagar in Villivakkam, RK Shanmugam Salai, KK Nagar, etc. They are getting inputs of IIT Madras engineers on designs to avoid flooding in these areas.

Prakash also said an Integrated Storm Water Drain Project (ISWD) covering North Chennai, like Thiruvottiyur, Manali Madhavaram zones, will be launched by CM Palaniswami in 10 days.

In the wake of cyclones that brought heavy rainfall to Chennai, city roads have been battered with potholes, which, when water-logged, become a major risk to commuters.

In Ambattur, residents in many sectors have claimed that sewage getting mixed with rainwater is adding to their difficulties. Several of them claimed their borewells providing drinking water have also been contaminated by sewage water.

Two days ago, the Chennai civic body had come in for flak after a 56-year-old man lost his life allegedly in an accident caused by a water-logged pothole, near Liberty Bridge in Kodambakkam.

In normal, pre-pandemic times, the main roads were a happy sight, with street vendors selling thinly sliced raw mangoes slathered in chillies and salt. During the hottest months – March to May – they also sell juicy water melon, ice apples and tender coconut water.

Unfortunately, the hot months are also when most smaller roads are crowded with people in queues waiting to fill pots and containers with water. Commercial and government tankers bring water to parched homes in the dead of the night or in the midst of a busy work day. No one knows when exactly they will arrive.

Water is scarce, so our agglomeration of 10 million people must get through the hottest, most humid days with as little water as possible. May is the worst month. This year, we are also in the midst of a nationwide lockdown because of the novel Coronavirus.

Many recall the frightful drought of 2019. Chennai’s municipal water-supply network went dry. For me personally, that was ironic. Lack of water affected us in the weeks before the release of my book on the catastrophic floods of 2015. At every book event I was asked whether I will write about the drought as well. I am not sure if I want to write about it yet. The truth is that Chennai is neither designed to cope with floods nor with droughts, but the climate crisis is making both ever more likely.

Chennai’s water comes from four reservoirs that are located a little outside the city. They are rain-water fed, which means that, when the monsoons fail, water shortages paralyse the city.

Chennai is the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. In 2017 and 2018, state politics was chaotic. Infighting kept our leaders so busy that they failed to notice the insufficient rainfall. The reckoning came in 2019 when the biggest reservoir, Chembarambakkam, went completely dry. News screens showed images of dead fish on the reservoir bed.

The irony was that the same reservoir had caused the 2015 floods. Back then, it had rained so hard it could not contain the water. Hundreds of families living along urban waterbodies were relocated to faraway places in suburban areas. They lost their possessions overnight, and then their claim to the city. During last year’s drought, the same families then had to spend a fourth of their daily incomes to buy water. The infrastructure of their new informal settlements is particularly poor.



Depending on Monsoon rain

Chennai receives most of its water from the northeast monsoon (about 60 %) in the months September to November. Last year, however, the northeast monsoon brought only 45 % of the long-term average. Because of that deficit, the city’s water-supply system failed.

Normally, the municipal corporation provides water to people, and we pay separate water taxes for that service. Last summer, we only got water once in 15 days where I live – and only for five minutes. The situation was even worse in other parts of the city.

When the pipes go dry, we can normally rely on borewell water which we source from the land our building stands on. Last summer, however, borewells dried out too. For the first time in nearly 17 years, the pump did not yield any water at all.

Like most of urban India, Chennai depends on groundwater for daily needs. In some places, this resource is over-used. For this reason, Tamil Nadu was one of the first states to make rain water harvesting compulsory in the city. The rule applies to all buildings – whether commercial or residential. When the rains fail, however, there is not much to harvest.

Borewell drilling was frantic last summer, sometimes with neighbours competing for groundwater. In several places people had to dig to a depth of more than 200 meters to even find water. According to official data, groundwater was vastly depleted in 22 of Tamil Nadu’s 38 districts. The hectic drilling was a scary glimpse of what the future will hold if the climate crisis escalates further.

At some point last year, everyone in Chennai had to buy water commercially. This struck a hard blow to the urban poor. The state government’s metropolitan water department, which normally provides water free of charge, sold this essential resource at a price of 700 rupees (the equivalent of about nine euros) per 9,000 litres. The price may seem low – and it was indeed the cheapest water available. The problem was that one had to wait for a long time to get it. The tanker we ordered only arrived after 20 days.

Everyone eventually had to turn to private suppliers. The price soared from 2,600 rupees for 9,000 litres in the beginning of the summer to a peak of 4,600 rupees. It sounds ridiculous in hindsight, but there was an extra charge for ‘clean water’. Otherwise the tanker dumped silted water into people’s home water storage area. This sharp rise in the cost of commercialised water hit the city’s poor and marginalised the most. Women were affected in particular (see box).

The state government was obviously unprepared. SP Velumani, its minister for municipalities and rural administration, even said that the drought was a rumour manufactured by the press. Soon after, Chennai had water shipments brought in by train.

Water is always a highly emotive issue in Tamil Nadu. State elections are fought over and won by who can bring irrigation water to the farmlands. Tamil Nadu is embroiled in fights over dams, reservoirs and river water with neighbouring states. A long-standing dispute with Karnataka can be traced back to the 19th century and concerns the river Cauvery. Last year, Kerala, another neighbour, offered extra water, but our state government turned it down, choosing politicking over people’s welfare.

Our ministers love photo opportunities when water is released from reservoirs and claim to personally have made it happen. Quick to take credit for success, they do not accept blame when a flood or drought occurs.

To tackle the problems long term, the city needs to improve its infrastructure. It is essential to rehabilitate hundreds of water bodies that have been encroached upon legally and illegally in the city. That would contribute to recharging groundwater and improving water tables in densely populated neighbourhoods.

Our ancient poets praised Tamil kings for the tanks they built. Unlike our politicians today, they understood how important water management is.

It is true that impacts of climate change are hard to predict – and it is even harder to build the infrastructure they make necessary. However, the time to prepare is now. It is a good sign that the state government has expressed awareness of the challenge. Its recent disaster-management plan mentions “climate change” 55 times. It proposes to restore damaged ecosystems and takes into account floods, droughts and other climate impacts. The assurances are still vague, but they do show that policymakers have noticed the problems.

That is not enough, of course. They must solve them, taking action in particular to protect the most vulnerable people. Chennai needs a water-management policy that serves the needs of the marginalised and oppressed communities. Piped water should not be a privilege of the rich.

Velachery, which had become notorious for waterlogging until a few years ago, has become a flood-free zone, say civic officials.

The locality was designated as “Vellacheri” (flood zone) by administrators as every year rainwater stagnated for days on several streets. This year, despite moderate to heavy rains, there had not been many complaints of water stagnation, say officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation.

The civic officials say the transformation was due to infrastructure development work carried out in the locality, which is situated adjacent to Pallikaranai marshland, and with a topography on a low-level compared to the sea.

The flood-prone areas covered several residential localities in west Velachery and Adambakkam. A senior civic official said several infrastructure development work involving construction of stormwater drain (SWD) had been completed on streets which were waterlogged.

Also the stormwater drain network was linked with the waterbodies in the locality and cleaning of the drain network, including the canals located on either sides of the Velachery railway station, were taken up paving for the rainwater to run off the road.

Also the commissioning of the underground stormwater drain in Velachery-Taramani Link Road helped in faster evacuation of rainwater into the Buckingham Canal, the official added.

Geetha Ganesh, Secretary, AGS Colony Residents’ Welfare Association (ACRWA), said every year the residents of the area used to wade through knee-deep water whenever there were rain but this year was different with the residents heaving a sigh of relief as the roads remained wet and not waterlogged.

She thanked the officials of Velachery division and storm-water drain department of the civic body for construction of new drain on Sixth and Seventh main roads of AGS Colony and renovating the old SWD located at the junction of fourth Main Road and cross street.

A senior official of the corporation said in the coming years several residential areas covering Brindavan Nagar, Mahalakshmi Nagar, Andal Nagar, AGS Colony, and Bhuvaneswari Nagar, would have no water stagnation once the new sluice gate was fixed at the outflow point of Veerangal Odai.

The drain network flowed from the residential areas through the Kalkinagar into Veerangal odai. He said: “If the Veerangal odai overflows, the rainwater stops flowing into the odai and there are complaints of backflow due to overflowing water. So, a sluice gate is being constructed along with a pump room installed with a heavy duty motor to pump out the rainwater.

As the monsoon hit cities, citizens were reminded of the mayhem that usually surrounds urban India around this time, where roads become canals, even if there is moderate rain.

Waterlogging — a prelude to urban flooding — is a common sight in urban India during the monsoon. Urban flooding has also become increasingly common, as the changing weather pattern resulted in more high intensity rain in fewer rain days.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) increased the problem of waterlogging as pre-monsoon desilting of drains was not carried out in full capacity.

There were several incidences of pluvial flooding in urban areas across India over the past decade. Some of these were a consequence of incessant rain over a day, for example, in Chennai and Mumbai in 2015 and 2005 respectively.

Others were a consequence of high-intensity bursts of downpour for three to six hours, suddenly overwhelming drainage systems. The trend of urban flooding and waterlogging has continued in urban India this year too.

July was the wettest month for Mumbai, which received 819 millimetres of rainfall on an average.

The city, however, received 675 mm of rain in the first five days of the month, with 427 mm on July 4, 2020, according to a report by international news channel Al Jazeera. This resulted in widespread flooding of roads and buildings in the city, with motorists wading through knee-deep water.

The National Capital Territory of Delhi received 74.8 mm of rainfall (recorded at Safdarjung) overnight on July 19, said a report by The Hindu newspaper. This resulted in widespread waterlogging in the city.

The downpour resulted in one person losing his life. Apart from that, all major junctions of the city were waterlogged. The city reported over 36 incidences of waterlogging and 14 instances of trees falling.

In addition, more than 10 instances of damage to buildings were reported, according to The Hindu. This included the collapse of over 10 houses in an informal settlement near Delhi’s ITO area.

Like Delhi, neighbouring Gurugram in Haryana was waterlogged with a 22-36 mm downpour recorded July 22 in some of the district’s weather stations, reported The Hindu.

Several parts of the city were waterlogged, with residents pointing this out on social media.

While these incidents were covered in the mainstream media, they were not isolated incidents: Most urban areas grapple with waterlogging and urban flooding every monsoon.

Context of urbanisation and climate change

It is important to note urbanisation is an inevitable process and urban areas will continue to grow demographically and spatially.

Cities — considered engines of growth — contribute more than 65 per cent of the national gross domestic product and provide employment to more than a third of the country.

The collateral damage emerging out of these expanding cities is the result of a breakdown in natural systems.

Urban areas, however, generate high volumes of polluted run-off, often resulting in the breakdown of the urban drainage system. In such a case, even moderate rainfall events can lead to flash floods in low-lying areas and can overwhelm drainage systems of cities.

It is evident that our weather patterns are altered because of global warming. There is evidence of change in some climate extremes based on data gathered from 1950, according to the Inter-governmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC).

In terms of precipitation, it is likely there were statistically significant increases in the number of heavy precipitation events, according to the IPCC.

Projections revealed a significant increase in mean monsoon precipitation of eight per cent and a possible extension of the monsoon period.

Extreme excess and deficient monsoons are projected to intensify, according to a 2006 study published in ResearchGate. In the future, high intensity rain over a few rain days is expected to become normal.

Issues related to urban stormwater management

Deficiencies need to be identified under several structural and non-structural dimensions related to urban stormwater management.

Cities were not planned keeping in mind stormwater management. In most cases, development control regulations in master plans do not provide for run-off control measures.

Also, open spaces and water bodies are victims of ‘planned’ encroachments. Urban streams and water bodies are compromised for urban land uses. A section of the Barapullah drain in Delhi, for example, is covered to construct a bus depot.

While the current response to urban flooding is limited to the construction of roadside drains, design standards recommended by the Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organisation (CPHEEO) are outdated.

While CPHEEO standards recommend a design according to one or two-year flood levels, drains are not able to accommodate increased run-offs because of more frequent high-intensity rain.

Stormwater drains in cities are generally in poor conditions, with operation and maintenance largely inadequate and ineffective.

Stormwater drains are often choked with municipal solid waste and construction and demolition waste. One such example is the choked drain in south Delhi’s Taimoor Nagar area, where garbage has piled up over the years.

In terms of non-structural deficiencies, there are no national / state level policy frameworks and / or guidelines for urban stormwater management in India.

Urban infrastructure development missions — including the Smart Cities Mission, the Swachh Bharat Mission and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation — fail to provide a comprehensive vision and strategy to address issues of urban flooding.

Measures by cities

Several cities in India have attempted to address issues regarding urban stormwater management.

Mumbai launched a state-of-the-art Integrated Flood Warning System (IFLOWS) in June, reported news channel NDTV. The warning system helps identifying imminent floods due to high rainfall or cyclones.

The Chennai Flood Warning System — that provides spatial flood warnings for the city — was launched in October 2019.

These systems help build resilience and can inform the public and authorities regarding risks. The India Meteorological Department launched the Mausam mobile application that provides rain forecasts including warnings.

The Karnataka government launched the Meghasandesha mobile application, which provides real-time rainfall measurements, along with forecasts for rain, flooding and thunderstorms for capital city Bengaluru.

Delhi has prepared several multi-dimensional strategies to address the issues of urban flooding. The city was the first to have a drainage master plan, prepared by the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.

The Delhi Jal Board also took up the revival of 159 water bodies in the city, along with floodwater harvesting projects in the floodplains of Yamuna. All these measures have multiple economic, environmental, social and urban benefits for the citizens of Delhi.

Both Chennai and Delhi also recommended for properties to implement rainwater harvesting structures as run-off control measures.

The Odisha government’s housing and urban development department issued an advisory for implementing rainwater harvesting in public parks and open spaces in urban areas across the state.

As knowledge partners, Delhi-based non-profit CSE prepared the Roadmap for implementation of WSUDP: Mainstreaming Rainwater Harvesting in Public Parks and Open Spaces in of Odisha report, which provides several design techniques and pilot case examples.

While these measures look good on paper, they must be followed through by effective implementation, taking operation and maintenance and coordination with stakeholders including architects, planners, hydrologists, groundwater experts, etc, into account.

These strategies must be prepared and implemented with the support and contribution of and the local community.

Recommendations

A systemic change — which comprehensively resolves structural and non-structural issues — is required to address issues of urban flooding. Some of these recommendations are summarised below:

Water-Sensitive Urban Design and Planning (WSUDP) and a green infrastructure approach for stormwater management: Identification, protect and use of open spaces and water bodies as critical green infrastructure to manage run-off and mitigate urban flooding. This must be done in addition to identification of urban catchments and prioritisation based on level of risk and vulnerability.

Identification, protect and use of open spaces and water bodies as critical green infrastructure to manage run-off and mitigate urban flooding. This must be done in addition to identification of urban catchments and prioritisation based on level of risk and vulnerability. Prepare drainage master plans for cities with short-, medium-, long-term and periodic strategies to augment stormwater infrastructure in cities. This must be aided by state-of-the-art urban watershed modelling.

for cities with short-, medium-, long-term and periodic strategies to augment stormwater infrastructure in cities. This must be aided by state-of-the-art urban watershed modelling.

191,730,chennai,2020,https://science.thewire.in/society/urban/chennai-adyar-river-recovery-pollution-investment/,28 Aug 2020,Adyar River Shows Signs of Recovery After Years of State Investment – The Wire Science,"The long suffering residents of Chennai have been living with two dead rivers, the Adyar and the Cooum, flowing through the heart of their city. These two rivers meander sluggishly through the city carrying sewage and dangerous pollutants. Besides these two rivers, there is the third one – the Kosasthalaiyar, which flows in the northern end of the city and not as polluted as the other two. These three rivers flow east towards the Bay of Bengal.

A river is considered dead when it is incapable of sustaining any form of life – fish or aquatic plants, in it. This happens when the pollution level in the river is so high that all the oxygen in the water is depleted.

The fresh water flowing through the Adyar and Cooum rivers are blocked upstream of the city and diverted to storage reservoirs for the city. The rivers also have sand bars blocking their mouth into the sea, thereby obstructing even the tidal flushing action from the sea.

The Tamil Nadu government has been working for a long time to restore the three rivers and several other water bodies in Chennai. Large sums of money have been allotted for this purpose but the progress has been slow. In the recent years, the government created a trust to coordinate a more concerted effort in cleaning the water bodies in the city.

A trust for restoring the rivers and waterways

The Chennai River Restoration Trust (CRRT) coordinates the work between various government departments, such as the Public Works Department (PWD), the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC), the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (Chennai Metro Water), Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) and some NGOs who are involved in this project. To facilitate the activities of the trust, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) under the Companies Act, called Adyar Poonga, was formed.

In 2019, the government allocated Rs 23.70 billion and Rs 13.70 billion this year for restoring and cleaning water bodies in Tamil Nadu. The government expressed its concern over the amount of raw sewage flowing through the river and allocated this amount mainly to clean the drains which empty into the river. However, the enormity of the problem is often difficult to comprehend.

Over the past three decades, the Adyar has been used as a dumping site not only for building debris but for municipal as well as industrial waste. During the massive Chennai floods of 2015 the river was flushed clean. But once the flood waters subsided it got polluted again.

A river, estuary and creek

The Adyar starts its 42 km journey at Adhanur and winds its way through Thiruneermalai, Tambaram, Manapakkam, Alandur, Saidapet and finally empties itself out into the Bay of Bengal between San Thome beach in the north and Elliots beach in Chennai city.

What makes the Adyar riverine ecosystem unique is that there is an estuary and a creek. The Adyar estuary region stretches from Thiru Vi Ka Bridge to the river mouth and the creek from the San Thome Causeway to the river mouth spread over 358 acres. The Adyar creek is a backwater estuary at the mouth of the river formed by a sandbar at the mouth of the river and runs along the coast. It starts near the Chettinad Palace and stretches north; surrounding Quibble Island.

Early on, the authorities realised that cleaning efforts by well-intentioned citizens would be of no use as the problem was too deep and a scientific approach was needed. In 2006, the Tamil Nadu government took cognisance of the problem and set up the Adyar Poonga Trust to protect and restore the three rivers, the Buckingham Canal and other water bodies in the city. The trust was later renamed as CRRT.

Moving people

One of the first issues which had to be undertaken in restoring the river was rehousing human settlements along the banks, according to an official source who wished to remain anonymous. A CRRT official added that 47 human settlement areas were identified along the Adayar River banks. Of the settlements that have been identified and located, 10 of them were beyond the project area and another 10 settlements were not affected by the project.

So, one of the first tasks undertaken by the CRRT along with the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) was the resettlement and rehabilitation of the people living along the river banks.

Of the 47 slums identified, 27 were within the project area from where families were to be resettled. There were 9,539 project affected families who were part of the resettlement and rehabilitation plan and have been shifted to tenements newly constructed by the TNSCB.

The irony of Adyar is that it is not just the poor and marginalised who live and play by the river. Once the river passes under the Kotturpuram Bridge the landscape of the river changes and those living on its banks are the rich and affluent.

On the banks of the Adyar is one of the oldest boat clubs in India – the Madras Boat Club. This river is one of the few in the country that is used for rowing. National and international competitions are held on these sluggish waters.

Revi Thomas, a veteran rower, says, “Thirty years ago when we rowed out from Madras Boat Club to the Broken Bridge the water was clear and the surrounding wetlands were conducive to bird life. We could see large flocks of birds near the river. Sadly, now we see nothing.”

Plugging sewage outfalls

Krishna Mohan Ramachandran, chief resilience officer, Chennai city (the Chennai chapter of 100 Resilient Cities programme, supported by the Rockefeller Foundation), said the pollution in the river increases once it enters Chennai near Porur.

According to media reports, the fiscal outlay of Rs 23.70 billion in the state budget was primarily targeted at plugging and mitigating sewage flow into the Adyar, Cooum and the Buckingham Canals.

An official source said that 67 sewage outfalls into the Adyar river were identified. To plug these outfalls, it was necessary to lay interception and diversion pipelines and this task is being undertaken by the Chennai Metro Water. The project will reach completion in 2022, according to CRRT.

The CRRT is also planning to set up four modular sewage treatment plants (STPs). According to the tender document, the contract of the STPs was awarded in February this year at a cost of Rs 126.2 million.

Ramachandran added that one of the other steps taken by the CRRT was to demarcate the land which ‘belonged’ to the river; which in some areas was 30 metres along the river banks and in others 50 metres. To this purpose the GCC began fencing the river in 2018. This fence is also a deterrent to dumping garbage into the river.

It is estimated that the GCC will spend Rs 22 crore to complete fencing along the river from Thiru Vi Ka bridge to Meenambakkam. The foundation and pillars are made of concrete with treated iron grills in between which will allow the flood waters to flow in between.

Adyar creek

According to an official at the CRRT, the initial restoration activities were undertaken in 58 acres of the Adyar Creek. The creek was used as a place for disposal of municipal solid waste, construction debris and sewage, which led to the severe degradation of surface and groundwater quality and destruction of habitats of avian fauna, reptiles and fishes. The creek was infested with Prosopis juliflora bushes, mosquitoes and bad odour which kept local people away.

The official said that in order to rehabilitate the coastal ecosystem of Adyar Creek, a slew of restoration works have started in the degraded areas. Desilting and removal of accumulated solid waste were taken up and the same were used to create mounds within the creek to enable plantation, reduce noise pollution and bring tranquillity to the restored wetland system. Sewage outfalls into the creek were identified and plugged.

A total of 143,818 saplings from 173 species of Coromandel coastal vegetation including mangroves and mangrove associated plants were systematically planted in order to restore the wetland ecosystem.

A glimmer of hope, finally

Today, there is some hope in sight as the restoration work undertaken bears fruit. These measures resulted in a substantial increase in the water spread of the creek from 5% to 59%, the CRRT official said. Planting of indigenous species resulted in a sizable increase in biodiversity of the creek due to the creation of habitat islands and edges with coastal vegetation which serve as a habitat for terrestrial animals and nesting birds.

The work done on the restoration has yielded some results. According to a policy note tabled in Tamil Nadu assembly for the year 2019-20, the faunal diversity of the Adyar Creek has gone up. The report said as many 8 species of molluscs, 13 crabs, 170 insects, 12 fishes, 10 amphibians, 19 reptiles, 120 birds and 16 mammals have been recorded. In the estuary 57,000 mangrove and 35,000 terrestrial saplings have been planted after the removal of invasive species, debris and plastic waste.

The CRRT official said that besides being a 58-acre lung space within the heart of Chennai city, the Adyar Ecopark today functions as a hub for imparting environmental education to the community at large, and students in particular.

But it has not been smooth sailing. The principal bench of the National Green Tribunal considered imposing a fine of Rs 10 million towards damages “for the repeated failure of the State in its duties in preventing pollution in the Adyar River, the Cooum River and the Buckingham Canal.”

But, a senior official of the Tamil Nadu government said that this is not an easy project. It is complex, as it involves so many governmental departments, so many entities and finally, so many people. Hence it would take time – maybe four or five years even to finally restore the river.

Governmental spending to restore the Adyar had begun in 1990s, and projects were initiated over multiple time periods. Though there is a glimmer of hope in the recent years, there is more to be achieved before the city dwellers can start seeing the river as a usable water body rather than a drain.

As the monsoon’s first heavy and prolonged rains lashed the city on Tuesday, life came to a standstill for a few hours in various parts at different points of time due to water stagnation. Towards early evening, waterlogging at important stretches gave way to traffic snarls.

Ahead of the Cyclone Nivar crossing the Tamil Nadu coast, several parts of the city received significant rainfall overnight with some reporting waterlogging in the morning itself. On Tuesday morning, Mambalam and Alandur had received 82 mm and 70 mm rainfall respectively.

Throughout the day, the rains continued to lash the city. The spell was severe in the heart of the city during the afternoon. Several subways, including the Nungambakkam subway on Nelson Manickam Road near Loyola College, were completely inundated. Vehicles had to take alternative routes. The RBI subway too had water stagnation after a spell of heavy rains.

Residents of R.K. Shanmugam Salai at K.K. Nagar said that despite rains lessening for a while in the evening, the water level did not recede on the roads.

Several smaller streets were temporarily inundated after the sharp, heavy spells.

Pavements submerged

Footpaths that are under construction in parts of Raja Street in T. Nagar were submerged after half-an-hour of rain. At many places along the street, slabs for footpath work were piled up. Water slowly drained out when the rains ceased for thirty minutes.

Santhome was flooded and the traffic police diverted smaller vehicles through the Marina loop road and Marina service road briefly. Flow of water at Vepery junction near Police Commissioner’s office and adjoining areas on Poonamallee High Road was slow and temporarily affected traffic movement. “Water from Purasawalkam and Vepery gather at that point since the culvert beneath the railway tracks is very small. The water has to cross Poonamallee High Road, then enter the culvert beneath the tracks and reach Buckingham Canal. At that point alone we have four pumps and a tanker removing water. But the volume is so huge that these machines are unable to pump out as quickly as needed,” said an official in the Highways department. A total of 55 pumps have been deployed across arterial roads in the city by the department.

Liquefied Petroleum Gas cylinder delivery did not happen in many places. A distributor in West Chennai said that of 550 cylinders sent out on Tuesday, 220 were returned to the godown since delivery personnel could not access the houses of customers.

Traffic congestion

Traffic snarls were witnessed on arterial roads in the evening as motorists struggled to cross the stretches with the rain water flooding the roads. There were traffic hold ups on Anna Salai, GST Road, Kamarajar Road and EVR Road owing to the temporary flooding at some stretches.

“From the morning, intermittent traffic snarls were reported from parts of the city as heavy rain caused flooding on the road. The width of these roads too had shrunk due to water stagnation and motorists had to navigate these stretches cautiously,” a senior police officer said.

As several offices in the north of the city were closed at around 3.30 p.m, traffic congestion was reported from Broadway till Teynampet in the evening.

N. Kannan, Additional Commissioner of Police, Traffic, and his team made spot assessments and expedited relief works at Guindy and a few other areas. There was similar traffic congestion on GST road from the Kathipara grade separator and police officers said that traffic movement became smooth after 6.30 p.m.

Roads were, however, deserted along the East Coast Road and Rajiv Gandhi Salai as the State-run buses were not operated and motorists avoided the road.",flood,Chennai Floods 2020,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",25 November 2020,26 November 2020,"['Chennai', 'Mambalam', 'Alandur', 'K.K.

Several parts of the city, particularly the southern suburbs, were flooded, with rainwater entering houses and causing hardships to residents on Wednesday.

With Cyclone Nivar approaching, the city received heavy rain for the second successive day, leading to flooding in many areas like Velachery, Madipakkam, Adambakkam and suburbs surrounding Tambaram. Low lying areas along the Adyar river were also affected by flooding. Some places in the western suburbs, like Padi, also saw rainwater entering houses.

Due to the downpour till Wednesday morning, several streets in Velachery were submerged under sheets of rainwater. Annai Indra nagar, Anna Nagar, Balakrishna Nagar, V.G.P. Selva nagar, Tansi nagar, Ram Nagar, and Dhandeeswaram were flooded. Udayam Colony, which is located on the border of Velachery division, was completely waterlogged, with sewage overflowing in several places.

M. Arun, a resident of Udayam Colony, rued that the residents were facing stagnation of sewage-mixed rainwater every year with no solution provided by the Corporation. After the 2015 deluge, several car owners in Velachery parked their vehicles on higher ground, such as on the Velachery bridge and on the Station Road, located near the Perungudi railway station.

In Irumbuliyur near East Tambaram, heavy rain flooded low lying residential areas where hundreds of families live. Residents had to leave the ground floor and take refuge in the upper floors or in friends’ and relatives’ houses.

Mudichur, which was inundated heavily in 2015, also saw waterlogging. Medavakkam, Chitlapakkam and Tiruporur also saw inundation. At Kotturpuram, houses on ground floors in low lying streets were flooded.

One family in Kotturpuram that has a bed-ridden senior citizen said they were worried about getting flooded due to the water released from the Chembarambakkam reservoir.

“We were affected by the 2015 floods. The level of the concrete on our street has increased and is slightly more than our apartment. At least eight houses will be affected,” a resident said.

Roads in posh localities like Boat Club were also flooded. In Egmore, rainwater entered a few restaurants and other businesses as well.

In north Chennai, residents of several areas, including R.K. Nagar, complained of sewage mixing with rainwater as drains were clogged. In Korukkupet and Vyasarpadi, residents in flooded streets requested the Fisheries Department to send boats to evacuate them.

Anna Salai, E.V.R. Salai, Kamarajar Road, Nungambakkam High Road, 100 Feet Road, East Coast Road, Thiruvottiyur High Road and many other arterial roads were inundated with one feet to knee-deep water, and traffic was very slow on Wednesday.

Flooded subways

Subways, including the RBI subway, were found to be waterlogged. Selvaraj, an auto driver from Velachery, said, “It was very difficult to reach Central railway station since the roads were flooded everywhere.”

Seenu, a call taxi driver, said, “We moved slowly with extra caution as all roads were flooded. It was tough to travel in my car to reach Chepauk.”

Residents of Varadharajapuram and Mudichur have demanded the implementation of various measures to prevent flooding in residential areas during the upcoming northeast monsoon.

The Water Resources Department (WRD) has started constructing a check dam across the Adyar at Varadharajapuram to alleviate inundation and also supply water to Chennai. However, members of the Federation of Varadharajapuram Welfare Associations said they wanted the river near the locality to be widened and the minor water channels crossing the Outer Ring Road to be improved so that they could carry more flood water.

The federation’s president V. Rajasekaran said a canal that was built at Royappa Nagar and linked to a stormwater drain along the State Highway should be made into a cut-and-cover water channel. Moreover, portions of the channel had been closed by people to build houses, which would affect the water flow during monsoon.

Government agencies should take measures to reduce inundation and also widen the stormwater drains along the Outer Ring Road, Mr. Rajasekaran said.

Residents also wanted sewage treatment plants to be built at Mahalakshmi Nagar and Royappa Nagar to prevent pollution in the river.

Excessive runoff

WRD officials said the portion of the river near the localities has the capacity to carry about 7,000 cusecs (cubic feet of water per second).

But, it gets nearly 11,000 cusecs during peak monsoon as tributaries join the waterway. Noting that measures were being taken to reduce inundation in low lying areas such as Varadharajapuram, they said besides widening the river, steps had been taken to form canals to carry the additional flow. A few sections near Mahalakshmi Nagar and Bhuvaneswari Nagar were yet to be widened due to encroachments.

Moreover, about 40% of work on the check dam at Varadharajapuram has been completed. Tributaries of groups of tanks, including Adanur, Mannivakkam and Manimangalam join the river near the site.

Besides groundwater recharge and mitigating floods, the ₹11 crore structure will store up to 80 million cubic feet of water.

There is a proposal to transfer water to Sikkarayapuram quarries and Chembarambakkam reservoir through a 13-km pipeline to meet the needs of the city, an official said. “We will strengthen the portions of river bund that was damaged during a project taken up by local bodies before the monsoon,” he added.

Proposals have been submitted for a straight-cut canal and provide shutters at inlets where small canals join the river.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Everyone in the city remembers the day the floodwater drained out, differently. Some were relieved, some were still in shock, some continued to look for loved ones, while others came home to devastation. But for almost all of us it was heartbreak. The city wore its defeat for days and nights on end. For a week after the floods, on the footpaths outside most homes were stinking piles of mattresses, pillows, quilts, cushions, straw mats, bedsheets and swollen rotting wood and food grains, and cars left open, even as the sun came down hard on us, making a mockery of it all.

Entire homes were being emptied out, like in my parents’ case. And before you knew it, the city was on the verge of a crisis. A garbage crisis. Thousands of sanitation workers from across the state were called in to Chennai by the government. And these workers had to deal with a city that had dragged decades of filth from its river beds, lakes and all kinds of things from people’s homes on to the streets, as well as animals that were handed the death sentence—about 100,000 tonnes of putrid trash. Apart from extricating dead human bodies from nooks and crannies, which had washed away in the flood, sanitation workers also had to deal with people defecating in the open, as flood-hit public toilets were non-functional.

The city’s sanitation workers, many of whom had their own homes destroyed, also reported back to work because they needed the money. They live outside the city, because of slum relocation drives, and neither help nor warnings had reached any of them. The city of Chennai clearly felt no senjotrukkadan for its brethren who came from other cities to clean it, it would appear, and instead ill-treated them.

Hundreds of workers complained that they were transported to and from their work places for the day in the same lorries in which they had transported garbage all day, exposing them, without proper protection gear and aid, to trash and diseases, and that they were treated worse than ‘kothadimaigal‘—bonded labourers. Several workers—who were involved in other trades before being engaged by the municipality for cleaning (agricultural labourers, electricians, and quarry workers)—complained of cuts, bruises and illness from the prolonged exposure to garbage as well as bleaching powder.

Many newspaper and independent media reports during the floods spoke of the poor conditions under which sanitation workers were being made to work. They also pointed out that help had not reached north Madras or the working class populace affected by the floods in the southern parts outside the city limits.

In a scathing report on the relief work related to the November floods that affected Cuddalore district, titled ‘Tsunami to 2015 Floods—No Respite For Dalits In Disaster Response, Tamil Nadu’, the National Dalit Watch – National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights, and Social Awareness Society for Youth Tamil Nadu, said that ‘in most of the places Dalit households have complained about the wilful negligence of government and other agencies of assessing the losses occurred to Dalits.

Many of the workers who were exploited by the state and made to work in dangerous conditions in the aftermath of the floods were temporary employees. Writing in detail for the Hindustan Times on the issues faced by the sanitation workers, Sudipto Mondal reported on 11 December 2015, ‘As many as 78 men from the Dindigul municipality are camping in a marriage hall in Gajalakshmi colony of Chennai. They were provided with only seven gumboots. None of them have been given gloves, masks, soap or oil. These luxuries haven’t been granted to local sanitary workers either. … Here is another well-known fact: all of Chennai’s and indeed all of Tamil Nadu’s sanitation workers are either Dalits or Adivasis. Most of them are from the Arunthathiyar Scheduled Caste. … Only around 700 of the 7,000 sanitary workers in the city are permanent employees of the corporation and get above Rs 15,000 per month. The rest are on contract and are paid anywhere between Rs 200 and Rs 290 as daily wages. No work means no pay. There are no sick leaves.’

Forty-two-year-old Palanichamy, who was brought to Chennai from Sholangapalayam in Erode, and Kantha Rao from Chennai, died as they were made to work under unsafe conditions for prolonged hours, while on duty, cleaning up the city. Conservancy workers had to clock over twenty hours cleaning up the garbage piled up everywhere. Adhiyamaan, founder of the Aathi Tamizhar Peravai—the Arunthathiyar movement that aims to ‘re-establish Arunthathiyar’s economic, cultural and social status’—also rued the fact that sanitation workers were not treated with even basic human dignity and that 400 of them had to share two toilets. They were not given glasses to drink water from and had to drink water using their plates. He also said that many workers were paid a paltry sum of Rs 50 per day for their work.

He asked, ‘Is this the right way to treat government employees? If a government servant who’s working as a peon, for instance, was being asked to travel, he would be given an advance or a TA/DA [travel and dearness allowance], right? They were given nothing of that sort and, to add insult to injury, transported in inhuman ways—in lorries, as if they were cows and goats—from far-flung districts like Ooty and Gudalur. Someone came from out of town to clean Chennai and died because of this. How did they decide that these people didn’t deserve the same kind of transport, stay and treatment that is offered to government employees who travel on work? In any case, what was the need to bring people from other districts to clean the city? Why didn’t they use machines to clear the debris everywhere, which would have been faster anyway? Many of them weren’t given any safety gear, neither gloves nor boots. People who belong to only one particular caste are doing this work. Our casteist society and people belonging to other castes think that these people were born only to serve others as if they are slaves. A deeply entrenched casteism among everyone here is the reason that these workers were treated this way.’

He also pointed out that people say, ‘This is their job, their duty. Let them do it.’ He added, ‘It is because of this mentality that even now, every month people die of toxic gas from sewage holes in our state. These are people who have been forced violently to perform these jobs because of the caste system. Nobody who’s doing this work enjoys it.’

To those who ask, ‘Why are you doing this job? Find something else,’ he said, ‘Even today in our villages, people are punished if they do not do this work that is heaped on them by other castes. Our belief is that not just our people, no human being should be asked to engage in manual scavenging and sewage cleaning. Use technology and machinery entirely. Everyone, including politicians, maintain silence when it comes to this topic alone. Why is there no political and societal will to end manual scavenging in our country, despite the laws?’",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Today, the city is running out of water, putting immense stress on the population and administration. The four major lakes that supply Chennai's drinking water are dry, the Krishna river scheme didn't provide relief and the Veeranam project has proved insufficient to meet the city's water demand. Ground water reserves are running low, too, leaving Chennai dependent on desalination plants.

One major reason for Chennai's water crisis is poor management of demand and supply. Over the past century, like in many other Indian cities, Chennai's water demand has increased significantly due to rapid urbanisation and industrial and agricultural growth. Hence, even slight fluctuations in supply can cause a crisis. Chennai's rainfall in 2018, 835 mm, was less than the average 1,400 mm, triggering the crisis this year.

The government's increased focus on desalination plants and on bringing in water from other watersheds might not solve the problem. Desalination plants mean major investment and operational costs, and the Krishna and Cauvery rivers are also affected by water scarcity issues. In the face of such dilemma, the city needs to consider implementing a comprehensive plan to avert future water crises.

The first step would be for Chennai to improve enforcement of existing laws on rainwater harvesting. Rapid urbanisation has led to the construction of more and more pavements which prevent rainwater absorption and groundwater recharge. Green spaces and wetlands-recharge points-need to be created across the city. Rainfall recharge structures in public spaces, like at bus stands and on roads, need to be improved. Corporate firms in the city could fund these solutions as part of their corporate social responsibility programmes, thereby reducing the financial burden on the city.

A second step would be to reuse wastewater. Chennai's lakes and rivers have been affected by sewage dumping. Small treatment plants, combined with apartment-level sewage treatment systems, could treat the water to be used for non-potable purposes (running heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and landscaping), without using more land.

Multiple Indian start-ups are working on providing solutions and revenue models, and need encouragement from the government.

Thirdly, Chennai's plan must also incorporate the protection of lakes and associated floodplains-major recharge points-which also help prevent floods. Rapid construction over floodplains has made Chennai vulnerable to both floods and drought. The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority needs to put an immediate stop to such construction and consider providing incentives to prioritise transit-oriented development along the ridges to reduce pressure on floodplains and allow land value capture for mass transit systems which generates revenue.

Fourthly, the government should provide open and transparent data on water resources and uses, such as the extent of water pipes and how much water flows through them every day. This will allow experts and academics to pool their thoughts and ideas. As part of the smart cities programmes and data initiatives, Chennai needs to digitise itself for reimagining its future.

And, finally, Chennai's irrigation efficiency needs to improve. Agriculture is the biggest consumer of water in India and there are half a million hectares of farmland upstream of Chennai. Improving irrigation efficiency will increase water resources. However, we can't expect small-scale farmers to implement high-cost irrigation systems. City governments and the banking and insurance sectors should explore new financial models that would allow them to invest in and improve rural irrigation systems.

This five-point formula might not add financial strain to any of the stakeholders-the government, farmer, residents, and corporates-and would improve the livelihood conditions in the city. With a recent NITI Aayog report claiming that 21 Indian cities would run out of ground water by 2020, there's no time to waste. We need to implement sustainable solutions with a focus on integrated water resource management to avoid our own 'Day Zero'.

The 2015 floods that devastated the city exposed the state of urban planning in the city. The lack of resilience to natural disasters remains one of the greatest concerns of the people of one of India’s largest cities.

What should be noted is that certain parts of Chennai experienced greater flooding than others and this impacted rescue and relief efforts. Poor urban planning, coupled with an expanding population that requires more space, leads to the city’s marshlands being encroached and green light for unauthorised construction.

Flooding in other parts of the country such as Maharashtra and Kerala for example, are also commonplace now. No city can be 100% prepared for something as unpredictable as the vagaries of nature, but can smart infrastructure help? It certainly will need to if the overall goal of a smart city is to be met, and Chennai is on the journey towards attaining such status.

The Chennai Smart City Mission shouldn’t restrict itself to making the city more livable, it also has to make it resilient. The National Disaster Management Act (NDMA) of 2005 has made it mandatory for cities to develop disaster management plans, emphasising four key aspects in particular – mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.

Marshlands speak of mitigation failure

Chennai has a history of growing at a steady rate in terms of population, transportation networks and construction. Take a couple of examples of existing structures: the airport is constructed on the banks of the Adyar river. The 2015 rains flooded the airport runways as the natural flow of the Adyar river was blocked. One of the largest bus terminuses in the continent – the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT) at Koyambedu, is also a flood prone area.

Besides the above, much of the urban poor reside in environmentally hazardous areas. As Armaan Ranjani Mustafa, Researcher – Urban Governance, Citizen Consumer and Civic Action Group puts it –

“It is common to see the urban poor in slums encroaching low lying areas, rivers, and tanks. Objectionable slums are moved to low lying resettlement colonies along Chennai’s peripheries. Other affluent encroachers in the state, such as hotels and malls, are exempted because they suited Chennai’s vision of a prime metropolis” (sic).

Move outside the city limits and we have a host of engineering colleges and IT companies constructed on waterbodies and marshlands. Many automobile and telecom SEZs are built on catchments. A few examples again: Hyundai motors has a factory near the Chembarambakkam lake and SIPCOT is located at a point where the Kovalam creek drains. Jayshree Venkatecan, from Care Earth stated in a 2015 interview that marshlands in the outskirts have shrunk, “these are now part of the IT corridor,”’ she said, sentiments echoed by writer and environmental activist Nityanand Jayaraman, who explained, in a 2015 column, how poor urban planning led to a vast reduction in marshlands.

These images show how in Chembarambakkam, various industries have populated hydrologically sensitive catchment areas with their factories.

A 2016 government report highlighted the level of illegal construction in the city. In particular, the report noted – “In the banks of the Adyar River, 4046 houses, identified as encroachments over a length of 839 m in the river bank, have been evicted and demolished.”.

Preparedness: Role of smart and digital infrastructure

A smart city can vary depending on the socio-economic and cultural make up of a city. A good smart city puts people first. It’s a purposefully broad term, encompassing housing, transportation, healthcare, technology etc. Where infrastructure comes in with respect to a smart city is liveability, usability and accessibility.

Smart infrastructure combines physical and digital infrastructure to provide information to enable better decision making, cheaper, faster and more efficient. Digital infrastructure is about connectivity and usability. One of the key aspects of any smart infrastructure framework is to better understand the existing infrastructures which can provide information to design and deliver new infrastructure.

Technology in many ways forms the base for a smart city. For policymakers, designers and citizens, technology facilitates decision making and ensures connectivity and data plays a crucial role in this. As William Eggers and John Skowron of Deloitte write –

“Increasingly, cities are putting data in the hands of end users to drive better decision-making. They tap into the collective intelligence of their constituents to create solutions around some of the toughest urban problems.”

As previously mentioned, existing infrastructure has already caused significant damage to wetlands and marshlands in Chennai. Going forward, smart infrastructure should play a role in ensuring two things for Chennai, and both need initiative from the government.

First, it must ensure that previous models of construction as mentioned above aren’t given the go ahead. According to a report by the Socio Economic & Educational Development Society (SEEDS) and the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), 56% of smart cities are prone to floods. Digital infrastructure can play a role in urban planning going forward. It can form a base upon which policymakers and civic officials can build effective plans for mitigating disasters and rehabilitation, while ensuring that new urban projects are ecologically conscious.

The first steps in Chennai

Digital infrastructure in the hands of governments, officials and policymakers can be put to best use in communicating and connecting with citizens. The ‘Namma Chennai’ app is one such example. Developed by the Greater Chennai Corporation as part of the Smart City plan, this is mainly used as a grievance redressal app for civic issues.

Last year, a web-based support system, TN-SMART (Tamil Nadu – System for Multi-hazard Potential Impact Assessment and Emergency Response Tracking) was launched to strengthen preparedness, response and recovery efforts in the event of a flood, cyclone and tsunami.

With the Chennai floods from a few years back exposing the lack of proper infrastructure to deal with heavy rains and subsequent flooding, the city would do well to use digital infrastructure to gauge the real time status of various drainage systems throughout the city. Couple this with real time weather analysis, it could help in preparedness.

One example can be found in Buenos Aires, Brazil. In the aftermath of severe flooding in 2013, the city decided to take action using digital infrastructure. The city government partnered with SAP to put sensors into drains and drainage pipelines. This meant real time data in terms of any blockages or hindered flow could be tracked for more than 1500 kilometres of pipelines. Chennai does have such plans under the TN-SMART system, but they aren’t under the realm or framework of the official smart city plan.

Similarly, another plan by the State government is to have real-time flood forecasting. This project announced in 2018, and delayed by a year, is being funded by the World Bank and aims to help local officials gather information on possible flood prone areas including the Adyar river and the Cooum. In the aftermath of the 2015 floods, the Tamil Nadu State Disaster Management Authority (TNSDMA) mapped the city to find more than 300 areas that were identified to be prone to floods.

The initiatives and policies announced by the state and city government have the right intentions. The best way forward would be to incorporate them within the larger scope of the Chennai Smart City Mission and ensure coordination among stakeholders. After all, one of the key agendas in Chennai’s Second Master Plan (SMP) is making the city environmentally sustainable while an important component of a smart city is liveability. To combine these, what Chennai needs isn’t just better urban planning. Digital infrastructure, as outlined above, should be at the centre of planning and implementation.",solution,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",12 December 2015,16 December 2015,"['Chennai', 'Tamil Nadu']",['120 cm (47 in) in 24 hours'],"['Rs. 10,000 crore (US$1.4 billion)']",['469'],"['18.3 lakh people were evacuated', '10 lakh houses were damaged', '12 lakh people were displaced']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

At first glance, it sounds nostalgic, sepia-toned, even pretty. But the truth is the opposite. The rivers refer to the Adyar, the Cooum and the Kosasthalaiyar—the triad that engulfed Chennai in 2015.

“We didn’t think they would remember. But they did. It was as if nothing had changed. We displaced them, disallowed them from entering their own turf. And then we built on top of their homes,"" Ge writes. Rivers Remember reveals that the deadly Chennai floods were entirely man-made, and that they are likely to happen in other cities too. Even jaded readers no longer surprised by government apathy are likely to be horrified at just how callous Chennai’s urban planners were.

Who: Ge is a writer, editor and fervent Chennai lover. This is her first book, and a very personal one. She writes with searing fury about her beloved childhood home being destroyed suddenly by the floods as her parents—neck deep in greasy sewage water—fled in the nick of time, with no warning at all. They were the lucky ones. Hundreds died, though no can agree on how many exactly.

Only a few days after the flood, a shocked Ge decided to write this book to find the answers to questions that plagued her. “Why did Chennai flood? Was it really because of a once-in-a-hundred-year rain, as the authorities claimed? Why was there no warning?""

She spent over three years interviewing victims, sifting historical archives, filing and chasing RTI (right to information) queries, speaking to journalists and reading disaster management plans. It was the hardest three years of her life, she says.

The toughest part, she says, “was the emotional toll"" of revealing her personal life to readers. “When you are a journalist, you are taught to stay outside of the story and not put yourself in it. I have been asked if I would have written this book if this had not happened to me, and the answer is, ‘I don’t know’. Or maybe I would have written it differently.""

What: You may have read coverage of the floods in the papers, or not, given that the Chennai floods were largely ignored by the national media. By the time the media woke up, Chennai was underwater.

That, of course, is the point of the book: to shock people into demanding action from public servants and prepare for the next catastrophe. The most chilling revelation is the unprecedented speed of the floods; people went to bed with no warning at 10pm and woke up drowning in the middle of the night.

Rivers Remember— #ChennaiRains And The Shocking Truth Of A Manmade Flood: By Krupa Ge; Context; 217 pages; ₹ 499.

Ge describes, in brutal prose, the slow deaths of a retired army man and his elderly wife in a ground-floor house. They were heard crying for help by their neighbours, who could not get to them. “The two of them would first stand on the table in their bedroom and shout for help. Later, they would add a chair to the top of the table and sit on it. All along they would be on the phone to their daughter. Ankle...hip…neck…and then the cries would die."" She concludes, tersely. “So would they.""

This could have been an overwhelming book, given the harrowing tales of death and damage. But Ge intersperses tales of the flood with calming histories of the Adyar, the Cooum, Buckingham Canal, and Chennai as a whole. This is not your conventional non-fiction book: Sometimes it reads like a memoir, sometimes like history, sometimes like Tamil poetry.

Ge has a wonderful eye for the absurd, especially peculiar to Tamil Nadu. Writing about the Chembarambakkam reservoir, which also flooded the city because water was let out too late, she snarks, “The opening of reservoirs and the act of providing water for drinking or irrigation have been spun by politicians as acts of individual grace and bravado.""

Author Krupa Ge writes with searing fury about her beloved childhood home being destroyed in those floods. Courtesy: Swaroop Mani

Why: Read this book for a deep dive into the terrible state of urban planning in India. Ge discovered that the floods were caused by years of inaction by the government. Before the 2015 floods, the Chennai disaster management authority, which is required to meet every quarter by law, had met just once. During the floods, it did not meet at all. One of Chennai’s biggest sources of water, the Chembarambakkam Reservoir, followed a rule book for flood management which was over 30 years old.

Her RTI application, which dragged on for a year, finally unearthed the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG’s) report, which laid the blame squarely on the government: for allowing illegal encroachments, not taking desilting work seriously, and permitting unauthorized construction. The word “failed"" appeared 38 times in the report. Given that people have been killed for RTI queries, Ge may still face a backlash. “My lawyer friends have told me, ‘Don’t think you have gotten away with it.’ But I think I have.""

Even Ge’s RTI could not unearth plausible figures on how many died. The government claimed 38 people died, but eyewitnesses saw many more bodies, with the toll likely to be in the hundreds. As Ge says: “Many migrants from other states, whose families can’t speak Tamil, may have been killed. No one knows.""

If there is hope in Ge’s book, it is from the accounts of residents and volunteers who helped, with the fishing community acting as “the first responders"", rescuing over 30,000 people. But Ge holds out little hope of change in urban planning.

“In 2016, the state came up with a disaster relief plan,"" she says. “But they copied it from Himachal Pradesh. A mountain relief plan copied by a flat coastal city!"" Another plan has been now floated, but Ge says it still does not address the numerous issues posed by Chennai. Meanwhile, slowly, inexorably, another flood looms.

Of floods and droughts

Chennai has seen the worst of nature’s fury several times in the recent past, with the frequency of floods and droughts having increased drastically. Post the historic floods in 2015, Cyclone Vardah devastated the city once again in 2016. However, as the monsoon had a very poor show in 2016, Chennai witnessed a drought in 2017 that had been unprecedented in the last 140 years.

Though the northeast monsoon was good in 2017, a heavy spell over two days in November 2017 caused a scare and brought back memories of the floods of 2015. Poor northeast monsoons in 2018 left Chennai reeling under severe drought in 2019 and the city’s major reservoirs that supply water — Chembarambakkam, Poondi, Red hills and Cholavaram — ran dry. National and global media were rife with reports of a Cape Town like crisis in Chennai.

In modern cities, well-networked storm water drains are a critical component to prevent flooding in cities. Chennai has 5500 – 6000 Km of roads and it’s highly important for all these roads to have SWDs, which in turn should be connected to bigger water bodies such as lakes, ponds and rivers in the city.

However, it has come to light that Chennai is woefully short of Storm Water Drains (SWD), which are essential for draining and harvesting rainwater.

Alarming numbers

Satta Panchayat Iyakkam (SPI), an NGO headquartered in Chennai, filed a number of RTIs with Chennai corporation as part of a study on the city’s storm water drain network. The responses reveal a deep problem in the city. The reply to the RTI stated that only 1894 KM out of the total 5500Km of roads in the city are networked with storm water drains as of October 2018.

This means that only 34% of the Chennai roads have the capacity to drain the rainwater that roads collect. The most shocking information was that Chennai Corporation built only 326 KM of SWDs over a span of 7 years (2008-2009 to 2015-2016).

To add to this, the limits of the Chennai Corporation have rapidly expanded in the last 15 years. In October 2011, the area within Chennai’s boundaries was increased from 176 square kilometre to 426 square kilometre and 45 wards were newly introduced. But the civic body has failed to cope with such pace of development. Though new taxes are levied on these areas, people do not have the most basic facilities that the local government must ensure. Among the crucial amenities missing are storm water drains. Despite repeated requests by citizens over the last eight years, even initial works for laying storm water drains are yet to begin.

In recent years, the Corporation, which learnt a big lesson after the 2015 floods, has stepped up its efforts towards expanding the SWD network. The civic body which built only 326 km of SWDs in the 7-year span till 2016, constructed 377 km of SWDs over just two years (2016-17 and 2017-18), according to the RTI data. However, this 377 km is included in the 1894 km of total SWD coverage, which is not even 50% of what Chennai requires.

Another revelation of note in the RTI is that the Chennai Corporations admits to have failed in carrying out any flood management mitigation work, other than constructing SWDs post the 2015 floods.

Water woes

Chennai city, which shares its zones with Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur and Chennai districts, has a huge number of lakes, ponds and marshlands. Most of these water bodies are encroached, have shrunk in size, or lack water that is fit for consumption and usage. As the connectivity of the existing SWDs with these water structures are poor, flooding occurs in lived-in localities, whereas the water bodies do not get recharged.

With an annual average of 1400-1500 mm rainfall, Chennai is one of the wettest places in Tamil Nadu. Ironically, the city suffers severe drought only because rain water is not harvested efficiently. In simple words, absence of SWDs results in both floods and drought for Chennai.

In addition to these woes with respect to SWDs, many residents let their raw sewage into water bodies directly due to a number of issues with their underground sewage system. This severely pollutes the water and the natural water bodies. The authorities have so far failed to take concrete action against such polluters.

Scams in the making

A number of scams related to SWDs have also been unearthed in the past few years by the Comptroller and Auditor General as well as NGOs like Arappor Iyakkam. Execution of storm water drains without topographical, meteorological and hydrological study and without ultimate linkage to natural water bodies has resulted in construction of drains with inadequate size, which would ultimately result in inundation of roads, says a damning CAG report released in 2017.

Out of the 54 new drains that were constructed by the corporation, 51 were found to be faulty and had to be reconstructed at a cost of Rs 54 crore. The initial cost of construction of these drains stood at Rs 21 crore. The negligence of authorities has consumed Rs 75 crores of taxpayers money.

Arappor Iyakkam also exposed various discrepancies in construction of SWDs last year. For no reason, existing drains were demolished and constructed by corporation as revealed by an RTI. Post this expose, Chennai Corporation assured that those drains wouldn’t be demolished and cancelled few tenders.

Planning, implementation, construction, enforcement, maintenance – Chennai Corporation has failed in all these categories when it comes to SWDs. Chennai will have to face the cycle of floods and drought till these SWDs are constructed and connected with lakes, ponds and marshlands which in turn are connected with rivers that ultimately meet the Bay of Bengal. It’s imperative that Chennai Corporation and Public Works Department understand the importance of this water chain.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Floods are a common occurrence in India, especially during the southwest monsoon season from June to September, and the northeast monsoon season from October to November. In past years, the country has witnessed many catastrophic floods which led to irreparable damage to life, property, livelihoods and infrastructure.

Let’s take a look at six of the worst floods to ever occur in India in the recent past.

1. Kerala, August 2018

Last year, the state of Kerala, famous for its beautiful monsoon scenery, faced the worst flooding episode it had seen in a century, after a spell of particularly heavy rains.

According to IMD data, the state received 2346.6 mm of rainfall from June 1, 2018 to August 19, 2018 in contrast to the expected 1649.5 mm. This heavy rainfall, combined with alleged delays on the authorities’ part in opening dam floodgates, swamped several districts of Kerala and triggered landslides in Wayanad and Idukki. Experts later labelled it an avoidable, man-made disaster brought about by indiscriminate deforestation, quarrying and sand mining.

With more than 400 reported deaths, lakhs displaced from their homes and estimated economic losses of Rs.30,000 crore, the floods left an incredible amount of damage in their wake.

It's been under a year since the floods, and rehabilitation work is still underway..

2. Chennai - November 2015

The 2015 floods in Chennai ended up being one of the world’s most expensive natural disasters in that year, causing India over 50,000 crore rupees in losses.

On November 29, a low-pressure area intensified into a depression, leading to huge amounts of rain in the coastal region of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Chennai recorded 266mm in the first 24 hours, and 490mm the next day, which eventually led to massive flooding.

By the afternoon of December 1, 60% of the city’s power supply was disconnected, leaving many hospitals nonfunctional and 40% of the city’s districts had submerged.

While the rescue and relief efforts started within a day of flooding and a lot of locals took initiative to help others, the damage was already done. More than 500 people died, over 50,000 homes were structurally damaged, and over 1.8 million people were displaced.

3. Jammu and Kashmir, September 2014

In 2014, massive floods hit Jammu and Kashmir and some areas of Pakistan. The situation was so bad back in 2014, that there were reports of bodies floating around the streets of Srinagar.

The disaster, which was caused by heavy rains, lasted for eight days. Jammu and Kashmir usually receives around 100mm of rain in September, but in the first four days of the month in 2014, the state had already received 400mm of rain, which led to the floods.

Advertisement From farms and roads to communication infrastructure, and homes to hospitals, there was little the floods did not damage. The economic value of the damage was estimated to be between Rs 5000 crore and Rs 6000 crore.

4. Uttarakhand, June 2013

One of the worst floods in India’s recent history occurred in Uttarakhand in June 2013. Heavy rain due to a cloudburst led to sudden flash floods and landslides in the northern part of Uttarakhand.

June is a rather busy tourist season for the state, as millions of Hindu pilgrims come here to pay their respects at the ancient temples. Since the rains occurred a whole month before the monsoon season, they caught everyone by surprise. The affected regions in Uttarakhand included Hemkund, Kedarnath, Badrinath, Valley of Flowers, Roopkund, and Rudraprayag

While the military was able to evacuate more than 100,000 people trapped in landslides, an estimated 4,094 were killed and over 5,700 were missing (and eventually presumed dead).

The Uttarakhand floods are considered one of the worst natural calamities in India since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

5. Assam, July 2012

In July 2012, heavy rains caused floods in Assam and it was one of the worst disasters that the state had seen in over a decade.

The monsoon rains started earlier and heavier than the previous year. The state got about 528mm rain, which was 28% more than its average annual rainfall.

Because of the flooding, there were 43 breaches reported in the Brahmaputra banks and 14 breaches on the banks of its tributaries. Many of the important rail links connecting Assam and the nearby states were also affected.

Following heavy rain, the mighty Brahmaputra and many of its tributaries breached their banks, destroying thousands of homes, bridges, roads, and even power lines. Over 124 people, including 70 children, died in the floods and about 2.2 million people were affected.

The floods also inundated large parts of the Kaziranga National Park and affected its resident animals severely. It is estimated that over 560 animals died, including 14 rhinos.

6. Mumbai, July 2005

While Mumbai witnesses heavy rains every year, July 2005 will remain etched in the city’s collective memory.

On July 26, 2005, Mumbai received about 944 mm rain in just 24 hours: a 100-year record. Over 1,000 people lost their lives in the deluge, while approximately 14,000 homes were destroyed. The ‘city that never sleeps’ was effectively paralysed.

The local trains stopped operations overnight, roads turned into rivers, and the city had to bear a direct loss of Rs 450 crore. The city's proximity to the sea, combined with poor water management by the authorities, reportedly led the situation to worsen as waterlogged roads turned into rivers and power supply was severely affected. However, good samaritans and charitable organisations poured out on to the streets with food, supplies and other assistance, bringing back residents’ faith in that much-abused term, the ‘spirit of Mumbai’, and helping the situation from spinning further out of control.",flood,Kerala Floods,Kerala,August 2018,August 2018,Several districts of Kerala,2346.6 mm,"Rs.30,000 crore",More than 400,"Irreparable damage to life, property, livelihoods and infrastructure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Inside Chennai’s “Day Zero” Crisis |,"Chennai faced a devastating flood in 2015 that killed hundreds of people and displaced many more. Today, the southern Indian city’s four main reservoirs are virtually dry.

This crisis is not only due to lack of water. Lack of proper management is exacerbating dry conditions in Chennai and many other cities around the world. If Chennai does not take action, it will likely face similar crises in the future.

Chennai’s Water Crisis Is a Management Problem

Chennai gets its water from four main reservoirs – Puzhal, Cholavaram, Chembarambakkam and Poondi. Puzhal and Cholavaram have completely dried up. Chembarambakkam and Poondi have little water left. While rainfall this week is bringing a temporary reprieve, reservoirs are unlikely to recharge until the Northeast Monsoon arrives, which is still months away.

In the meantime, the city and many of its more than 10 million residents are now desperately drawing water from wells, further depleting scant groundwater resources. Others wait in line for hours to get water that’s trucked in from other locations or pay exorbitant sums to private water providers.

While last year’s poor monsoon season contributed to the current crisis, Chennai’s water scarcity has worsened in recent decades, driven largely by unplanned urbanization and increased consumption.

Chennai’s population has increased from 500,000 to more than 10 million over the last century. Its economy and appetite for water-intensive industry, products and agriculture have grown in-step with population. According to WRI’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, Chennai faces extremely high baseline water stress, meaning that on average more than 80% of the available water supply is used up every year by agriculture, industries and consumers.

At the same time, the water that is available is becoming increasingly polluted. Dumping untreated sewage into lakes is common practice in Chennai. These pollutants also seep into the soil and affect groundwater, further worsening the city’s water security.

5 Things Chennai Can Do to Increase Water Security

Many have proposed ideas such as bringing water from other watersheds or investing in desalination plants to provide water to the increasingly water-stressed city. But bringing water from distant watersheds such as Cauvery or Krishna wouldn’t help Chennai in the long run, as these watersheds are also facing water-scarcity issues. Desalination plants could address some of the concerns, but they are very costly and consume a lot of energy. Chennai’s government is in the throes of a crisis – a difficult situation in which immediate action must be taken to sustain residents until the monsoons come. The city should also think about taking steps to help avert a similar situation in the future:

Harvest rainwater: The easiest and lowest-hanging fruit for the city is to better enforce existing laws related to rainwater harvesting in buildings. Rapid urbanization has brought more and more pavement into the city, which prevents groundwater recharge and rainwater absorption. Recharge points like green spaces and wetlands can absorb stagnant water from roads and increase groundwater levels. Corporations could also fund these solutions as part of their corporate social responsibility programs. Reuse wastewater: The Cooum and Adyar rivers carry a huge amount of sewage into the sea every day. Multiple lakes across the city have also been affected by sewage dumping. Small sewage treatment plants combined with apartment-level sewage treatment systems could help treat the sewage without using up more land. The treated sewage water could be reused for non-potable purposes (such as running HVAC systems, flushing toilets and landscaping) across the city while improving water quality overall. Conserve lakes and flood plains: Chennai’s master plan must incorporate the protection of lakes and associated flood plains. Flood plains are the biggest recharge points. They also help prevent floods. Rapid construction over flood plains has made Chennai vulnerable to both floods and drought. The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority should immediately take steps to stop construction over floodplains and consider providing incentives to prioritize developments over ridges instead. Open data: Part of the problem is that the government does not provide open and transparent data on water resources and uses, such as the extent of water pipes and how much water flows through them every day. More research and analysis could be done with open data, which could help lead to better solutions. Many experts in the industry and academia would be able to pool their thoughts and ideas if data were made available to them. Improve efficiency: Agriculture is the biggest consumer of water resources around the world, and India is no exception. Improvements in irrigation efficiency can increase available water resources for other sectors, including municipal users. Although many of India’s farmers, most of whom are small scale, cannot implement high-cost, more efficient irrigation systems, new financing models can help. City governments could explore and implement policies to invest in and improve rural irrigation systems. Without addressing rural and agricultural water, Chennai (or any part of Tamil Nadu, the state where Chennai is located) is unlikely to solve its water crisis.

Ensuring Water-secure Futures for Cities Like Chennai

While Chennai’s “Day Zero” water shut-off was the latest to make headlines, cities around the world face similar problems. Cape Town, South Africa, experienced a similar situation a year ago. São Paulo, Brazil, nearly ran out of water in 2014 and experienced another severe drought last year. WRI’s Aqueduct tool shows that 36 countries are considered “extremely water stressed,” where more than 80% of the available supply is used up every year by agriculture, industry and consumers.

Cities around the world cannot afford to wait. They need to implement sustainable solutions with a focus on integrated water resource management to avoid having their own “Day Zero” experience. Chennai and other cities like it could be water-secure again, but only if we start acting now.

At least, initially, and for those of us with tech skills. Volunteers in safer places were looking up tweets under this hashtag and attending to people’s needs – checking in on someone’s parents, calling people up, connecting those stuck with rescue workers, aid and more.

As local celebrities like actor Siddharth – who said he “freaked out” that he had lost his house, three studios and three cars for the first time – lent their support, the hashtag gained a lot of momentum. With the help of a more egalitarian medium, radio, and celebrity RJs like Balaji throwing their weight behind it, the social media support spilt over on to the streets.

Massive spontaneous rescue teams were formed across the city. People hired large vehicles to recce flood-hit areas and rescued those stranded, and hundreds reached out with essential supplies. Trucks filled with food, water and more were coming in from states near and far.

The Jain temple on GN Chetty Road churned out 5,000 packets of breakfast, lunch and dinner. All mosques in the city opened up their doors for people irrespective of their faiths. Major cinema halls like Sathyam and Mayajaal also opened their gates to those stranded. Strangers opened up their homes.

Restaurants like the Old Madras Baking Company and Double Roti offered food and a resting place for free to those who were passing by, while Jonah’s and Tryst Cafe delivered it straight to those in need. You could rest assured that if someone in the city was not affected by the floods or had escaped it after being stuck briefly, they were involved in rescue and relief work during those four days in Chennai. The city organised itself in an admirable manner and even in the midst of all that heartbreak, there was something heartwarming happening somewhere in the city.

Like when the young engineer and volunteer, Muhammed Yunus, after hearing about the 800-odd people stuck in Urappakkam, found seven boatmen willing to brave the waters and go on a rescue mission. Chitra, who was pregnant and due in two days, and her spouse Mohan were among those who needed to be rescued. Yunus, along with the boatmen, helped the couple reach safety, from where they made it to a hospital in Perungalathur. Chitra delivered a baby girl and named her Yunus.

Not all help during these floods, however, was ad-hoc. Some, armed with the experience of having worked during several disasters, stepped in, and soon, an assembly-line-like system was set up. Bhoomika Trust, which works in the areas of disaster relief and rehabilitation, networked with many other NGOs and organised one of the largest relief centres in the city.

Bhoomika set up a control room to reroute messages and calls of distress to concerned authorities and teams in the respective zones. A massive community kitchen began operations on 3 December and distributed an average of 30,000 to 40,000 food packages a day through different groups of volunteers and NGOs.

“The community kitchen predominantly coordinated with volunteers and citizens of Chennai. Between 3 December and 9 December, Bhoomika distributed 1,90,000 food packages,” Latha Subramaniam of the trust said. The large community kitchen and the disaster relief kit packing section had over 10,000 volunteers clocking more than 1 lakh volunteer-hours in all.

For 70,000 families going back home after the floods, Bhoomika offered dry ration kits with rice, dal, oil, tamarind and spices for fifteen days. The trust has also been involved in long-term rehabilitation of victims from remote villages and continues to help them with housing.

In the week after the flood, my aunt, who works in a school for Adi Dravida children, told me over the phone that many families near her village outside Chennai had lost everything, and that “her kids” – as she likes to call her students – didn’t have as much as clothes. I was able to quickly source dry rations through Bhoomika for over a hundred families, and what I witnessed when I went to their relief camp was terrific and impressive.

Bhoomika was operating out of a large wedding hall, where I saw hundreds and thousands of people walking in and out with aid. I had no connections to the trust. When I reached there, I called a friend who was volunteering.

The next thing I knew, my aunt was sitting in the front seat of a mini-truck we booked using Lynk, an Uber-like app for trucks, with the dry ration kits. She was also carrying clothes for her students, which I had picked up from my friend Amba’s home, who was also helping out those affected. I had told her about the clothing needs of school children of various ages over Facebook messenger and Telegram. As phone services were largely disrupted, relief work in the days following the floods was organised over social media and WhatsApp.

My appreciation for my smartphone and the interwebs grew manifold that day. But this also highlighted how the divide between those who had access to resources and those who did not was reflected in the digital world as well. This stark digital divide stood out during the floods, alongside the fact that the marginalised across the state were unable to access relief, even though others could claim it easily. It was not for lack of trying. There were forces at play that were working hard to deny some people aid, while ensuring that others got it.

Pianist Anil Srinivasan was involved in rescue, relief as well as rehabilitation of flood victims in the city. During the floods, he worked with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) over the phone, directing them to people who needed to be rescued. Eighteen other volunteers camped at his third-floor apartment and helped with the coordination. Once rescue work ended, he joined an initiative by the Rotary Club of Madras, of which he is a member, to put together a relief centre.

The Hyatt hotel opened up its storage space as a relief camp as well as provided meals for all the volunteers. Srinivasan, along with Ashok Thakkar of Rotary, wanted to do more. The then commissioner of Chennai Corporation, Vikram Kapoor, told them that children displaced after the floods from the Adyar’s banks to Perumbakkam, an area seventeen kilometres away from their earlier home, needed a school.

Srinivasan donated his entire earnings from 2016 to the school. Vish Vishwanathan of Anuja San Antonio, “a non-profit created to promote sister-city alliance between San Antonio [Texas, USA] and Chennai” too offered support. With the help of doctors in San Antonio, many of whom are from Chennai, and with the help of other NGOs, Vishwanathan managed to raise $200,000.

The Tata group’s CSR initiative donated the remaining funds, Rs 3.9 crore, to complete the school. “It took us until the end of 2016 to raise the funds, Rs 5 crore,” Srinivasan said. “The Corporation of Madras has given us the land. Running around to get permissions took us another six months. The school is now coming up really well. We have a large library space.” This consortium of do-gooders will handover the school for the children of Perumbakkam to the city corporation by June 2019.

The flood has come and gone but the rehabilitation process of those affected continues to this day in Chennai and elsewhere in the state.

During the British era, carefully classified water bodies were brought under the revenue department, a highly centralised system with no involvement from local communities.

In this commentary, Anjana Vencatesan establishes the need for Chennai’s hydrology to become an intrinsic aspect of its urban planning and development.

As Chennai goes to polls on April 18, the commentary highlights the need of incorporating hydrological concerns into the larger urban planning process.

It is an era of rapid urban expansion that ignores sustainable urban planning principles until disaster strikes. The city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu is no exception to this rule.

The Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) defines the limits of the city and has undergone rapid expansion over the decades, particularly in the late 2000s. From 1991-2011, the extent of the CMA was a mere 176 square kilometres including only the Chennai district. As per the 2011 Census, it expanded by almost four times to 426 square kilometres. In subsequent years, the CMA expanded to include taluks from the neighbouring districts of Kancheepuram and Thiruvallur and currently stands at 1189 square kilometres.

In January 2018, the government of Tamil Nadu released a government order for public consultations with the proposal to further increase the CMA by including 1709 villages from the neighbouring districts. Once effected, this would result in a seven-fold increase in CMA area from the current 1,189 to 8,878 square kilometres. A year later, following a public interest litigation in the Madras High Court, the proposal lies in limbo with reports that it may be scaled down in the face of protests from farmers against converting agricultural lands.

Cascading wetlands amongst four rivers

In the face of such expansion, it is essential to consider the role of hydrology and water management. The city of Chennai falls under the Chennai river basin in Tamil Nadu. Overall the hydrology of Chennai is composed of a system of cascading wetlands and three rivers. The three main west to east running streams in the Greater Chennai Corporation are the Kosathalayar, Cooum and Adayar rivers. In the CMA, there is an additional river, the Araniyar.

Another major channel in Chennai is the Buckingham canal, running north to south, which was an artificial construction connecting all coastal wetlands and was conceived as an inland waterway for transport. In addition to these, there are the three reservoirs of Chembarambakkam, Poondi and Red Hills. In the proposed expanded area, there will be a total of eight rivers – Swarnamukhi, Araniyar, Kosathalayar, Cooum, Adayar, Vegavathi, Cheyyar and Palar. Except for Kosathalayar and Araniyar, all of the others are seasonal rivers and they function as the primary drainage channels for excess storm water running into the sea.

In South India in general and Tamil Nadu in particular, the terminology of water bodies have historically been varied and detailed and the management of these has been customised according to the type. The classification of water bodies was based on three main parameters – extent, depth and the flow pattern. Based on the above, local nomenclature for them included ery, kulam, kuttai, thangal, odai, madavu and urani.

Under the British regime, this responsibility was brought under the revenue department, with most of the management being undertaken by civil engineers. In effect, it became a highly centralised system with no involvement from local communities. This centralised management persisted post-independence with the responsibility now being handed over to the Public Works Department (PWD).

Multiple bodies managing the water resources

In present-day Chennai, the management of water resources involves multiple government departments and agencies – the PWD, the Chennai Corporation, the Municipal Administration and Water Supply (MAWS) department, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB), the Chennai River Restoration Trust and the State Wetland Authority. In addition to this, the State Disaster Management Authority is also mandated to oversee the restoration of wetlands.

Despite the existence of multiple specialised agencies, there are several flaws in the planning and management of Chennai’s water bodies. First, the last proper survey on the area and extent of water bodies (known as the Field Measurement Book or FMB survey) was conducted by the government in 1987. As a result, there is no data on the actual loss of wetlands. This, combined with severe encroachments over the years, means that presently, there is no accurate figure of the number of water bodies in Chennai that is unanimously accepted among the various government departments. A detailed list of the administrative jurisdiction of wetlands is absent and fundamentally, most water bodies including marshes and seasonal wetlands are still classified as “wastelands” — a remnant from British era classification methods.

A network of blue and green

Chennai derives its resilience from “a network of blue and green” — a network of wetlands and vegetation cover. The city already has heightened vulnerability to cyclones owing to the Bay of Bengal. Further, a decrease in both wetland area and vegetation area only adds to the susceptibility to extreme weather events. The series of maps (Figures 1 – 4) illustrates how the rapid increase in the built-up area has happened at the cost of the loss of the city’s critical wetlands and how the areas affected by flooding are directly correlated.

In 2007, a risk perception study for extreme weather events in Chennai was conducted by the University of Freiburg, Germany, Care Earth Trust, Chennai and Loyola College, Chennai, supported by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ). This consisted of the analysis of flood risk exposure, analysis of risk perception and management and the development of flood risk maps. One of the takeaways from the study was that floods are quite a regular occurrence in the city.

The study documents a total of 26 floods from 1943 to 2006 with a sharp increase in the number of floods from the 1970s. Another key takeaway based on the analysis of meteorological data from 1813 onwards is that there has been no increase in the rate of rainfall received annually over the years. The flooding events in 1996 or 2005 had therefore been caused by strong single rainfall events exacerbated by anthropogenic pressures.

It is therefore evident that the urbanisation of Chennai has happened at the cost of the integrity of its hydrology. As the peri-urban areas around Chennai expand, the construction of urban infrastructure is taking place on water bodies and this combined with flooding, poses a significant threat to the water security of the urban and peri-urban areas. In addition to the established risk of flooding, a study in 2017 outlines the major causes of water-related stresses as the over-extraction of groundwater, degradation of wetlands, a thriving informal and unregulated water market, climate change and drought.

The hydrology of Chennai is a fundamental aspect of its urban planning and development. Unfortunately, this has been largely ignored in the face of rapid urbanisation. The extreme weather events and risks have forced the city to correct its course and this can only be done with a complete revamp of its hydrological management strategy.

A critical component of this is the recognition that the rivers of Chennai are not standalone entities and therefore, restoration works on individual rivers will not be effective as intended. The focus should be an integrated approach to restore and manage the entire Chennai river basin as a single unit. Since the hydrology has been highly influenced by human intervention, conventional approaches will not be effective.

It is also important to realise that these water bodies were traditionally built for irrigation requirements and therefore, management should be modified to suit current and future needs. Overall, the focus of building resilience should be on minimising the uncertainties associated with urban management and this can only be achieved by correcting the legacy of mismanagement proactively.

In 2004, soon after the Indian Ocean tsunami left several thousands dead in a deadly attack a day after Christmas, an officer of the Indian Administrative Service, on relief duty in Tamil Nadu, held forth on the efficacy of the immediate response. “Remember,” he said confidently, “there is a robust first line response in Tamil Nadu; it is built into the system. It will kick in at every level, automatically, in times of crisis.” He had fair justification for what he said, for at that time, the response of the State post the tragedy was stunningly well-organised.

Eleven years later, after the December 2015 floods in Chennai, it could have been another State all together. In hindsight, it was a watershed moment. December 1, 2015, provided a clear indication that the much-feted, fabled response system of Tamil Nadu had collapsed. And, that included its capital city too. It was also when the people rose as a colossus, resilient, and all this not just on social media, but willing to share their homes, food and clothing, putting a shoulder under the burdens their neighbours, friends, family, even complete strangers, carried. Together, they picked Chennai up and put her back on her feet, because they wanted to, because they could.

This colossal let-down of a trusted authority is what Krupa Ge brings to the consciousness of the reader, with Rivers Remember .

A touching story about the people who suffered, rendered, at times lyrically, poetic as a gently flowing river, and then, with cold facts, cold as the waters that swirled the muck into homes.

Without a doubt, it is the chronicle of a Chennaiite, one who loves the city she grew up in.

She brings together facts most residents of the city have been aware of, since that dark December of 2015, but deftly weaves them into the stories of Nalini, Anantha, Paranjothi, Sudha Ramalingam, Dr. Bala, and traces the scars they, and countless others, still carry from that traumatic month.

Man-made disaster

While, unquestionably, there was extreme provocation, in terms of immediate environmental causative factors, Krupa reasons that the magnitude of the destruction that ensued was certainly man-made. A combination of factors beyond control did play a role, but there is no looking over what is clearly decades of bad urban planning, and abysmal disaster management, she says.

The ‘once-in-a-100-years’ (rainfall) theory was repeated every time a question was asked of the State government. But truth to tell, every decade has seen heavy rains with flooding in Tamil Nadu, Krupa points out.

The strength of the book is that it minces no words, calls a spade a spade, and worse. The author goes on a quest to look for the real reasons — rampant encroachments along waterways and on waterbodies as the State looked the other way, poor communication and warning to the people of flooding, poor post disaster relief and rehabilitation, some of it mired in politicking.

While the State government grew comfortable with its oft-repeated ‘act of nature’ excuse, a Central committee pointed out: “Instead of putting the blame on the forces of nature, we should use technology to fight it out.” The author also questions deliberate obfuscation of details of water release from Chembarambakkam, said to be a key factor, and the actual number of dead.

As she hitches her skirts, walking through tenements, speaking to people who measure the height of the flood through marks the water left on their walls, and rolls up her sleeves, filing batches after batches of RTI applications, digging though multiple reports, waving her fingers at government officials for all the sanctioned violations and concealed data, Krupa is on a mission for the city she loves. There are lessons for everyone in Rivers Remember . We would do well to pay heed — the monsoon has arrived.

Sixteen people have died already after five days of heavy downpour in Mumbai. But it is not about the death toll alone: Many more precious lives are put at risk, livelihoods are compromised as daily routines are put on hold even as a familiar script plays out in India's financial capital monsoon after monsoon.

And it is not Mumbai alone. Indian cities, croaking under ever-increasing burdens of population, have been falling prey to floods so often (think Chennai, ironically starved for drinking water) that it has become the new normal.

So is that it? Are governments and people helplessly supposed to take urban flooding as normative? Or is there something to be done?

There is actually. Only if careful attention is paid. Down To Earth has been covering the issue for some time now. Here are some ready reckoners:

The north phase of Ambattur Industrial Estate was nearly paralysed for a couple of days as several units were under sheets of water during the recent rains. The shrinking capacity of the Pattaravakkam Canal was one of the main reasons cited for the flooding.

Addressing a press briefing on Tuesday, the Ambattur Industrial Estate Manufacturers Association’s (AIEMA) president A.N. Sujeesh said nearly 100 units were affected for a few days after a sharp rain spell as the area was inundated with the spillover from the canal. While one of the arm’s of the canal drains into Korattur Lake, the other joins Otteri Nullah. Inflow into Korattur Lake has been blocked to prevent sewage mixing into the water body.

The canal carrying surplus water from Ambattur Lake travels through the Industrial Estate and joins Otteri Nullah near Korattur. It’s width has narrowed down from 25 feet to 10 feet at Korattur, he said.

Members of AIEMA said the flow into the canal is blocked near Korattur to prevent water-logging in the residential area and this added to the inundation in the Industrial Estate.

Mr. Sujeesh noted that the industries in the north phase suffered a loss of ₹100 crore during the rainy days. The Estate had already suffered a severe crunch after the 2015 flooding as there were not many orders. Such inundation after short spells would lead to losses, he said.

Moreover, sewage from the neighbouring residential localities, including Athipattu, Pattaravakkam, Mangalapuram was also linked to the stormwater drains in the estate. Members of AIEMA suggested that the canal be desilted and widened. A diversion channel must be constructed along Third Main Road of the Estate to drain the surplus water into Cooum River, they said.

AIEMA’s vice president M. Balachandran said the Estate treats its sewage in treatment plants and also has a common effluent plant. The neighbouring residential areas must be provided with sewage connections to arrest sewage discharge. A monitoring body with various government agencies and AIEMA must be formed to find a solution to the issue. The problem would be highlighted at a meeting to be convened on December 27.",issue,Ambattur Industrial Estate Flood,"Ambattur Industrial Estate, Chennai, Tamil Nadu","December 17, 2019","December 19, 2019",North phase of Ambattur Industrial Estate,Heavy rain,Loss of ₹100 crore to industries,0,Inundation of several units in the estate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

26 Sep 2019

During the fag end of 2015, Chennai experienced severe floods resulting in the death of about 500 people and economic losses of about INR 50,000 crores. The flooding stranded the city and was termed a 'man-made disaster' resulting from irresponsible water management and rapid urbanisation. The northeast monsoon of the year left most parts of South India marooned, exposing how vulnerable our cities are to such catastrophes.

""That's when the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser took a major initiative to develop a real-time, integrated, urban flood forecasting system that was non-existent in our country. It called for a meeting of experts among multiple government agencies and academia,"" recalls Prof Subimal Ghosh. He is currently a Professor at the Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay).

Soon after, with a team of scientists from various institutes across the country, he swung into action to develop the first-ever expert system in India to forecast floods.

An expert system is a computer-based program that makes decisions and predictions based on a set of data. The researchers designed the flood forecasting system in a record year and a half.

""It was highly interdisciplinary, and a team of 30 scientists from 8 institutions took the responsibility. I led the project, and this is one of the best learning experiences of my life,"" shares Prof Ghosh.

In a recent study, published in the journal Current Science, the researchers shed light on the development of the automated flood forecasting expert system. The study was funded by the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India and had a committee of experts chaired by Dr Shailesh Nayak, Ex-Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES). The research team comprised of scientists from the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, IIT Madras, Anna University, India Meteorological Department (IMD), National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), Noida, National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), Chennai, Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad, and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Hyderabad.

The expert system designed by the researchers has six components—some running in parallel and a few dependent on each other. It has computational models that can forecast regional weather and surges in the tides and storm. It also has data from sensors that measures water levels in the rivers. Hydrological models, which consider reservoirs and river flows, are also included in the system, along with flood models that calculate which areas would be inundated. The system produces visual maps of forecasted inundation. All these components are automated and need no manual intervention at any stage.

The data for the expert system include rainfall and weather parameters; tidal and ocean depth data obtained from the Adyar, Cooum and Kosasthalaiyar river mouths in Chennai; water levels in these rivers; reservoir levels of Chembarambakkam and Poondi reservoirs; historical rainfall data, and the current land use, topography and drainage data. The output is an inundation forecast of 6-72 hours with ward-wise three-dimensional maps showing the depth of the predicted flooding and its area.

The complex calculations based on these parametres happen in a jiffy in the expert system.

""Normally NCMRWF releases the forecasts at 3 PM, and within the next two hours, our expert system will release the first forecast for the next three days,"" shares Prof Ghosh. ""If there is a forecast of heavy floods, the real-time computing operations start, and the forecast will be updated every 6 hours,"" he explains. The level of details thus obtained can help rescue and alert operations.

The expert system also has a databank to speed up the process of forecasting. It has 796 scenarios resulting from rainfall extremes with different severity of water flow and tides, and past rainfall.

""Flood simulations for large cities take a very long time. Hence, we have generated the extreme possible cases in a data bank,"" reasons Prof Ghosh. As soon as the input forecasts arrive, a search algorithm finds the closest scenario from the data bank and releases the first forecast.

The researchers have validated their system with data from the December 2015 floods. They found that their inundation map with flood depths was 80% accurate within one metre as compared to the real flooded regions.

""We also experimentally verified its performance during the winter monsoon in Chennai, and found that it was working well,"" says Prof Ghosh.

Currently, the entire expert system is transferred to NCCR, Chennai, which is maintaining it. It is now working on an experimental basis and will be fully operational after a year. The researchers believe that their system can also be used for flood forecasting in other cities too.

""This is quite a robust framework, and MoES is using it for developing a similar forecast system in Mumbai. We are delighted that MoES finds our approach very useful and is implementing for other cities,"" concludes Prof Ghosh.

This article has been run past the researchers, whose work is covered, to ensure accuracy.

As the singular official document that sought to audit and place accountability for the floods, this report was significant. It should have been shown to the public as soon as possible, so that all the stakeholders, especially those of us affected by the floods, could learn the truth and take steps to avoid another disaster. Moreover, the city of Chennai had the right to know why it flooded and who caused this flood, and this interest far outweighed any ‘privilege’ the people we elected to offices enjoy. Lawyers and activists who regularly use the RTI told me how information never comes out from the government departments in the first instance. Unless one persisted through appeals, usually at least two rounds of it, what one sought would remain elusive. Luckily for me, the same week a response to my appeal was due, the TN government finally tabled the CAG’s report on the floods out of the blue, on the last day of the assembly session, 9 July 2018. This meant that no debate took place around the report. By the time this report came out, it lost its newsworthiness and was buried in the inside pages of newspapers.

In March 2018, the leader of the opposition in Tamil Nadu, M.K. Stalin, asked the government on the floor of the assembly why it had not tabled the CAG’s audit report on the 2015 Chennai floods. The deputy chief minister, O. Panneerselvam, replied that the government had sought legal opinion from the advocate general, on 13 February 2018, on tabling it. The CAG’s report was submitted to the TN government on 1 June 2017. That is when those of us following the flood story first got an inkling that perhaps the CAG had said something controversial.

In the 171-page report, the CAG explained the various reasons that may be attributed to these floods. The most scathing remarks in the report were reserved for the way the TN government had handled the tank that had caused the floods:

On 1 December 2015, at 2 p.m., when the Chembarambakkam Reservoir had 3.377 TMC water—which was 0.268 TMC less than the total capacity of the tank—the amount being released from the tank was increased from 12,000 cusecs to 20,960 cusecs. Again, at 5 p.m., the discharge was increased to 25,000 cusecs and from 6 p.m. to 29,000 cusecs. The CAG felt that since the tank had space for another 0.268 TMC, the amount of water released from the reservoir could have been maintained at 12,000 cusecs for another six hours and even then the tank would not have reached the brim. The auditors also came to the conclusion that this indiscriminate release of nearly 21,000 cusecs was made to save illegal encroachments in the foreshore area of the reservoir from submerging.

‘This was a serious failure in operation of the reservoir, thus, contributing to the massive disaster. Such imprudent and injudicious action by the Tank-in-charge as well as WRD warrants detailed enquiry [emphasis added],’ the report said. No action, however, has been taken based on these findings. The report also pointed out that the indiscriminate discharge of water at 29,000 cusecs continuously for twenty-one hours from six in the evening of 1 December until three in the afternoon of 2 December into the Adyar River, in addition to the water from upstream tanks and catchment area, caused a huge flow of floodwaters into the river. It blamed the state’s non-existent Emergency Action Plan—‘due to GoTN’s failure to update its system/manuals as per CWC (Central Water Commission) guidelines’—for the unsustainable manner in which water was released from the tank, drowning a hapless population, while also losing precious water that could have served the city during the dry months. History seems to have repeated itself in Chennai.

There is an uncanny similarity between what happened in 1877 in Adyar and what happened in 2015.

Writing about the great wastage of irrigation water in 1877, William Digby said:

As an instance of the frightful waste of waters which occurred, the case of Adyar river may be taken. Nothing was done to conserve the water in its channel. For three days the river flowed full from bank to bank—250 yards wide at the Marmalong bridge. In the middle of the stream, for the width of one hundred yards at the least, the current was moving at the rate of two miles an hour: the depth of water was four feet on an average. It may be that there was not tank accommodation available for the storage of more water. But, even from the tanks, the waste was enormous. The Marmalong tank at Saidapett (a suburb of Madras) may be taken as an indication of the waste permitted. This tank, when it was seen by the present writer a few day’s after the rain, was discharging over its waste weir a volume of water six yards wide and one yard deep, flowing at the rate of five miles per hour. The reason given for this outflow was that, if the water were retained, some of the banks of the tank might give way. Yet the level of the water in the tank was below what it frequently had been, and no disaster followed. The truth was this: the budget for petty repairs of tanks was so cut down at the beginning of the revenue year, that funds were not available for carrying out such precautionary works as were absolutely needful. The system by which works are done is so unsatisfactory that engineers, though they see the necessity for saving water, are unwilling to take the responsibility of keeping the water in the tanks, in the absence of that protection to the banks which they feel is necessary. They, therefore, choose the lesser of two evils, and, rather than risk a breach of the banks, with consequent flooding of the country around, and much damage, they consider it wise to let the water run to waste, and keep the level in the tank very low.

A good portion of the CAG’s observations also pertain to planning or the lack of it in the state capital—no frequency-based flood inundation maps, no Emergency Action Plan for dams, no basin-wise comprehensive master plans prepared to respond to challenges posed by heavy rains, no law on Flood Plain Zone resulting in large buildings coming up on the banks of rivers and obstructing the free flow of floodwater, and no updated Water Policy. The report blamed the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), which issues permissions for the construction of buildings and other development, for liberally allowing constructions in zones meant for other purposes, resulting in a steep increase in the built-up area. Such unauthorised constructions, it said, shrank the city’s water bodies and led to massive inundation during the floods.

On encroachments, the report said, ‘Despite enactment of a law in 2007 to protect tanks from encroachment, the percentage of tanks encroached, kept increasing year after year.’

The report also pointed out that eight drainage-related projects in Chennai that were part of the JNNURM were not finished because of encroachments and lack of coordination between different departments—a charge that would be made against the state’s various departments over and over again in the years following the floods. These incomplete projects, apart from poorly designed stormwater drainage networks, the CAG felt, contributed to flooding in many areas.

This report also blamed the government for not taking desiltation work seriously enough and for not releasing funds for the same well before the monsoon. The CAG felt that the ‘non-execution of works before monsoon hindered the free flow of floodwater’ and added that this too led to flooding. The report concluded that the Chennai floods of 2015 was ‘a manmade catastrophe’ and found that the failures of various departments of the Tamil Nadu government had caused the floods. The word ‘failed’ appears thirty-eight times and ‘failure(s)’ forty-one times in this report.

All these cities have shown us the costs of disregarding and abusing our urban commons and wetlands, which used to be referred to in Taamizh language with respect, using a special term: Poromboke. The question is, are we willing to see and learn?

Every instance of heavy rainfall in a city reminds us what happens when our urban development authorities and administration ignore the rivers and wetlands in our cities. Rivers Remember: #ChennaiRains and the Shocking Truth of a Manmade Flood by Krupa Ge is one more stark pointer.

The book is an outcome of the author’s effort to understand what caused the flood in December 2015 in Chennai. Her book brings back memories of three rivers that traverse the city: Kosasthalaiyar, Adyar and Cooum. She also weaves in stories by listening to the tales of people living on the banks of the Buckingham Canal and in close vicinity of the lakes in Chennai city.

Between the lines

The book opens with a very personal account of how her parents’ home went under water on that fateful night of December 1st, 2015. By the time you move from the first story to the second story in the book, you realise that this author is going to work her way through the dual metaphor of ‘our home’ vs ‘their home’, wherein the latter stands for the claim of rivers and wetlands over the land on which their waters have flown.

This is not quick disaster reportage from ground – although even that genre of human interest reporting may have its own value – but a result of three years of persistent effort by an author to understand urban planning, administration and disaster preparedness in Chennai. She laments that “the ancient practice of kudimaramathu – kudi meaning people and maramathu meaning repair, wherein a village was responsible for maintaining, repairing and taking care of water bodies – died out over time.” (p. 18).

She also tells us about her own earnest efforts to become a water literate citizen, her own moment of learning and finding out about the waterbodies on which Chennai’s water supply depends and how urban expansion has undermined this very complex network of waterbodies and drainage system.

However, this book is not only about the question ‘What caused the flood?’ – even though that is a title of a chapter where she tells us of her efforts to find the answer to it by filing numerous RTIs and knocking several doors. It is also about the way fellow citizens came forward to organise the rescue and relief missions. Krupa goes to fishing hamlets and brings back with her stories about how the young boys from the fisherfolk community rushed in with their kattamarans and boats to lend a helping hand. If on one hand the book brings back the painful memories of avoidable casualties and deaths, it also gives us a glimpse of guardian angels such as those who relocated expectant mothers from Dr Bala Kumari’s nursing home.

The author also keeps transporting the reader back and forth over several centuries through her ability to weave in the narratives from earlier accounts on these rivers and quoting from memories shared. She acknowledges the debts that she owes to her sources every time she writes and at the end of the book you find the citations that runs into 105 endnotes!

She thus leads curious readers to historian Venkatesh Ramakrishnan, who is known for his work on the cartography of the river Cooum. When she talks about the Ennore creek and the toxic pollution caused by the North Chennai Thermal Power Station, she makes us acquainted with the wonderful activist Pooja Kumar of Coastal Resource Centre. She also talks about the work of Nityanand Jayraman of Vettiver Collective.

A notable coincidence

Interestingly, I got a first glimpse of this book not at a bookstore, but on the table of Vettiver Collective last June, when I was speaking to this activist scholar about the impacts of the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (SIPCOT). As we talked about the importance of auditing land acquisition and allotment practices in Tamil Nadu, I noticed the book and was curious to know what it talked about.

It instantly caught my attention; I have written extensively in the past about the performance audits carried out by CAG of India on flood control and management programmes, and in one article I also wondered, ‘When will our auditors learn from ecologists.’ I discovered that this book actually takes a deep interest in the Performance Audit by CAG of India on Chennai Floods.

Krupa Ge tells us about her efforts to trace the CAG report, whose tabling got delayed by almost a year. It was through her sustained efforts to use RTI application and appeals against the first reply, that she chanced upon 320 pages of correspondence between heads of different line departments replying to the performance audit and the then chief secretary of Tamil Nadu trying to obfuscate the auditors and delay the final report.

Readers who wish to really understand how brazenly our administrators could refuse or parry responding to the constitutional auditor, do look at the excerpt from this book here on The News Minute.

But more importantly, I think the pertinent question that arises from this book is how little do we learn from the frequent urban flood disasters. Lest we forget, here is a one-page excerpt from yet another CAG audit report that tells us how the Electronic Development Corporation of Tamil Nadu had delayed execution of flood mitigation works for 10 years.

Necessary reminders

In the final analysis, as the song by Kaber Vasuki, Chennai Poromboke Paadal sung by T. M. Krishna reminds us:

“It was not the rivers that chose to flow through cities

Rather, it was around rivers that the cities chose to grow”.

Whether in Maharashtra, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala or West Bengal, a careful look at the performance audit of disaster management and flood control works would point to the need for analysis of the root causes of the disease. That root cause many a time is outdated manuals of the management of waterbodies and dams, coupled with a failure to respond to constitutional auditors and the lack of humility to learn from past mistakes and blunders.

For the sake of creating awareness of ground realities among the people, may the tribe of those nameless auditors who studied the Chennai Floods 2015 under the CAG of India and wrote an eminently valuable stand-alone report, as well as of authors like Krupa Ge, grow.

Meetings are frequent, with the chief minister, ministers and the chief secretary of the state going over whether all departments are on the same page with respect to rescue and relief operations if the need arises.

Tamil Nadu has suffered extreme weather events frequently, most discernibly since 2015 when south Chennai was flooded due to heavy rains and consequent flooding on the Adayar river. Since then, cyclones Vardah and Gaja, floods in Cuddalore and Nilgiris have ravaged various parts of the state.

The Lede decided to find out how ready the state is in terms of dealing with yet another extreme weather event should it arrive this monsoon.

“We are ready,” said K. Satyagopal, Commissioner of Relief Administration.

Satyagopal explained how the government went about a methodical process of identifying risk, forecasting risk, response to risk and reducing risk.

To this end, a massive exercise was carried out in the months following the Chennai floods of 2015. Vulnerable areas across the state were identified based on legacy data of rainfall, reservoir levels, rivers in the area and other factors. A source analysis of the problems in these areas were also carried out – was there a river that flooded in the past, was there heavy downpour or a cloudburst, was there a breach of a bund.

These vulnerable areas were then classified as Very High (5,78), High (892), Moderate (1,206) and Low (1,723) zones.

Detailed maps of these vulnerable areas have been created and maintained by administrators who would be involved in rescue and relief operations.

“We have mapped down to the firka level in rural areas and to the ward level in urban areas,” said Satyagopal. “The CRA’s office along with the district collectors carried out this elaborate exercise.”

This team also took up data on the number and location of relief centres in the past in these vulnerable areas and the specific rainfall data at the time. Since the data was pooled, it has also been continually updated.

Quick response systems

One of the key problems during the Chennai floods and the Gaja cyclone was the lack of quick rescue and relief operations. Many were stranded as authorities struggled to reach them. And with communications shut down, the task of rescue was made almost impossible.

To address this issue and to tide over technological failure, the state has put in place a network of people who would act as immediate responders during times of crisis.

First responders have been appointed and trained by the administration. These are residents in villages within vulnerable areas who would be the first to alert authorities in case of an extreme weather event.

These first responders have been trained under three categories – to evacuate people, to protect livestock and to plant trees during non-monsoon seasons while cutting away fallen trees during monsoon and cyclones.

First responders who are trained to evacuate people number 30,759 of which 9,162 are women. Those who are tasked with saving livestock numbered 8,624. Those who deal with trees number 3,824 across the state.

First responders form the backbone of the Inter Departmental Zonal Teams which are headed by either a Deputy Collector or the Tahsildar. Each team comprises police, fire services, an agriculture department official and a Public Works department official, amongst other departments.

Each team is in charge of six to ten vulnerable locations. The total number of teams formed in Tamil Nadu are 662.

“When we receive an IMD (Indian Meteorological Department) forecast about a possible extreme weather event, a team will be positioned in that area and they will be in touch with the first responders,” said Satyagopal. Maps of the area would be made available with these teams which would have the contact details of first responders, nearest police stations and fire stations on the back.

Apart from this, volunteers from NGOs like the Red Cross and the Sathya Sai Trust have been attached and trained with the IDZ teams to act as Disaster Response Guards.

“We have simultaneously strengthened our State Disaster Response Force in line with the National Disaster Response Force,” said Satyagopal. “We have now got an exclusive battalion of 1,000 personnel in the TNDRF (Tamil Nadu Disaster Response Force). The state initially sanctioned a sum of Rs 15 crore for equipment and another Rs 30 crore last week for this,” he said.

The TNDRF has been trained for not only responding to natural disasters but also to man-made disasters, just like the NDRF.

The NDRF and the TNDRF have jointly trained new recruits in the police force in dealing with disasters as well. A total of 6,606 police personnel have been trained so far in rescue and relief operations.

The state has already contacted and reviewed preparations for natural disasters with hospitals, oil companies, mobile service providers and educational institutions to ensure they are not caught unawares.

Hospitals have been asked to ensure that ICUs and CCUs are kept running round the clock at any cost. Generators have been elevated to ensure uninterrupted power supply in case of floods. Veterinary hospitals have been asked to ensure that they have necessary back-up in place. College managements have been told to ensure food and shelter for students who stay back in hostels.

COWs have been kept on standby. These are not the bovine variety but an acronym for Coverage On Wheels – towers mounted on vans with generators that can be deployed to areas where mobile connectivity has been snapped off during an extreme weather event.

TN Smart

The Tamil Nadu state government has also designed and developed the TN Smart app. This app is web-GIS based and combines big data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence to assess and alert citizens and authorities about risk.

The software uses satellite imagery, UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) data which is being collected by Anna University and LiDAR) Light Detection and Ranging to provide accurate analysis of risk during extreme weather events.

Users of the app are two-fold – those that provide rescue and relief and the public which can use it in times of distress.

TN Smart mingles legacy and current rainfall, reservoir levels and other data to analyse and predict which areas are at immediate risk of flooding. Once authorities are able to get the exact picture of where flooding is likely to occur, messages can be sent out via TN Smart to the public in those areas as well as to the IDZ and first responder teams.

“We have built in a feature that forces the phone to ring even if it is on silent mode when an alert arrives,” said Satyagopal. “What if the emergency is at night? Most people and even officials will be asleep with their phones on silent.”

“Even during the day, sometimes officers may be in meetings with their phones on silent mode and may miss alerts. So we designed it in such a manner as to ring until the user manually switches it off. That way no one can miss the alert,” he said.

So far, TN Smart has been downloaded by 2.3 lakh users, of which the public is 1.5 lakh and first responders are 11,895.

TN Smart has found special mention in the UN ESCAP (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia Pacific) report of 2019.

The Odisha and the Uttar Pradesh governments have shown an interest in adapting TN Smart for their respective states.

22 countries expressed interest to the RIMES (Regional Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System) council which is chaired by India, to adopt the TN Smart model and tailormake it for their own countries.

Of these, nine countries – Bangladesh, Fiji, Myanmar, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Tonga – have already initiated the process of replication.

Mitigating floods, preventing drought

According to Satyagopal, desiltation of water bodies and waterways has been carried out on a war footing to ensure higher capacity of water storage of water bodies, which helps in mitigating floods as well as in preventing drought.

32,399 water bodies have been desilted and restored by municipal authorities as well as by the Public Works department. The nutrient rich tank silt removed was to the tune of 7.44 crore cubic metres and this has been distributed to 6.6 lakh farmers for use in their fields.

Satyagopal says that an additional 2.62 TMC of water storage has been created as a result of this exercise.

“We have cleared 3174 kilometres of irrigation canals and river courses. 14,627 supply channels have been desilted. Blockages have been removed in 1,01,582 culverts and 6320 bridges,” said Satyagopal.

A policy decision was also taken to put in side vents for all bridges. This is to ensure that during times of high water flow under bridges, the structure itself will not collapse. 171 bridges across the state now have additional side vents.

Smaller engineering tricks have also been carried out in an effort to reduce damage cause by floods. For instance, pipe culverts are more prone to damage during floods. The government decided to convert these into box culverts and so far 7,048 such conversions have been carried out.

Floating garbage that clogged up water bodies and canals have been removed, flood regulators have been built to manage flow of water, encroachments have been removed in vulnerable zones and “cut and cover” models have been used in areas like Narayanapuram and Mudichur, to ensure that flood water flows below roads rather than above them.

Long term flood mitigation efforts too have been worked on.

On February 8, deputy chief minister and finance minister O. Panneerselvam announced an important flood mitigation project in Cuddalore:

“As a special measure, this Government will take up permanent flood mitigation works like formation of reservoir across Orathur tributary of Adayar river with inter-basin transfer canal for water supply augmentation and flood mitigation near Orathur village in Sriperumbudur taluk; regrading of lower Paravanar river and formation of a new flood diversion canal from Aruvalmooku stretch in Kurinjipadi taluk; construction of new flood regulator across Coleroon river near Perampattu in Chidambaram taluk; construction of tail-end regulator across Upanaar river near Pitchavaram village in Chidambaram taluk to arrest sea water intrusion and ten other works at a total cost of Rs.284.70 crore in the coming year.”

This allocation is apart from the previous year’s allocation of Rs 100 crore for flood mitigation works in Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur and Rs 290 crore for Greater Chennai.

The Aruvalmooku project in Cuddalore is now complete and provides connectivity from the river to the sea, which will help mitigate floods in the flood prone district.

﻿

With large parts of the state experiencing severe water scarcity in the summer gone by, measures have also been taken to prevent drought in the future.

“There are a large number of defunct borewells across the state,” said Satyagopal. “We decided to convert them into recharge wells so that when it rains, ground water level will be improved. So far we have converted 7,299 defunct borewells to recharge wells. We have also converted 3137 open wells to recharge wells,” he said.

The next step that district administrations will embark upon is to identify unused borewells and open wells in farmer fields and convert those too into recharge wells for better ground water.

In Orathur, an additional small reservoir has been built to store drinking water. This reservoir can hold 0.75 TMC of water.

“We started with data collection and we have learnt a lot along the way,” said Satyagopal. “We want people to download and use TN Smart so that we can better communicate with people during crises and ensure that the impact of natural disasters is mitigated.”

Will all of these measures work though when the cyclone or the cloudburst strikes? Tamil Nadu has an impressive history of bureaucratic thoroughness and impeccable implementation.

Case in point is the massive rescue and relief operations that were launched successfully post the 2004 tsunami, when Indians did not even understand what the word meant.

The Tamil Nadu model was then hailed internationally as an example to be emulated, as the administration anticipated and battled the spread of disease in the wake of rotting corpses and survivors suffering from PTSD.

The administration though has been recently singed by singular criticism of its delayed response to the 2015 Chennai floods and to the Gaja cyclone of 2018.

The government of the day too is more secure now than it was since 2016 – the ruling party is united and there are no immediate challenges to the government before Assembly elections in 2021.

It is more than likely that the executive and the bureaucracy will be on its toes come monsoon this year.

And when Tamil Nadu’s officers so decide, it is not impossible that they will put in place a model for other states to emulate.

Tamil Nadu will find out in the coming months.

It felt as if all of my memories had been violently erased. The beautiful, quiet by-lanes where I scraped my knees learning to ride my brother’s bicycle (a cool green Streetcat), where I climbed trees, played cricket, hide-and-seek and hopscotch, made great friends and led (in hindsight) a charmingly simple life in skirts and blouses, my oiled hair in two plaits held together by white ribbons... were all unrecognisable.

That night the roads were pitch dark and the homes empty. Candle lights flickered here and there, but mostly an eerie silence enveloped me as I stood in disbelief. And then, when I walked into my home a little away from the banks of the Adyar River, I realised what it meant to lose everything you grew up taking for granted. Like the bed I’d slept in for most part of my life. Or the computer table that bore witness to my many Road Rash game sessions, and my irresponsible movie watching spree (even on the day before my physics board exam. Sorry, mom and dad!) The dining table that I always found to be too clunky, but still miss when I walk into our house nearly four years after the floods...

After we emptied my parents’ home out, for nothing the river had touched felt safe to us, we went to buy furniture from good old Mani and Co in Royapettah. A mango wood cot, a teak dining table with two chairs, and a divan. After hearing our story, a kind flooring contractor gave us a good deal on vinyl flooring. The mosaic tiles of the apartment had dark patches that refused to go away despite our valiant attempts with cleaners of all manner — mild, organic, chemical and industrial strength.

There was no time, however, to sit back and think. We had work to do. Clean, clean, clean. Replace, repair and recuperate. But slowly, as the days passed, the questions began to rise. Questions I had no answers for. In fact, no one around me did. These questions became the crux of the many RTIs I filed in the process of writing my book Rivers Remember (Westland).

Rivers Remember; Krupa Ge

The title came from the piece Rivers that Remember and Cities that Forget , written by Vikram Doctor in the wake of the Mumbai floods 14 years ago. The piece re-appeared after the Chennai floods, asking important questions and speaking with a clarity that appealed to me and, indeed, to many of us who were angered by the catastrophe. By August 2016, I had a book proposal ready and a roadmap to follow. I wrote a note to myself: What I would like to produce is a comprehensive account of what went wrong on December 1 , 2015, and what the water did to this city that goes parched every year in the month of May. Ironically, as the book readied for launch in June, I was flooded (pun unintended) by calls from people on the severe drought in Chennai, which has been exacerbated by political inaction, yet again.

Over several months, four of us (three lawyers and I) filed nearly a dozen RTI queries with various departments of the Tamil Nadu government, as well as the CAG, the central audit body that took stock of the floods. I wanted answers: How many people died in the floods; how did the government inform those about to be flooded that they were indeed going to drown; the number of people rescued and placed in camps; which were the areas where word went out about the impending flood; who were the government officials in the loop about the amount of water being released into the Adyar River from the Chembarambakkam reservoir that eventually drowned vast swathes of the city.

In the course of the three years it took me to write the book, I met lawyers and activists who were working on various environmental issues pertaining to our city, the rivers and the floods with passion and generosity. Their commitment and selflessness gave me hope, despite the depressing facts I discovered about the floods and the ways in which our natural resources are being laid to waste.

I read a news report about a PIL that had been filed on the deluge and went online to the Madras High Court website to track down the petitioner. Before I knew it, I was staring at hundreds of pages of precious information, court proceedings and orders, all handed to me by the advocate (who chose to remain behind the scenes for he did not want to take any attention away from the issue).

In the meantime, my RTI queries were being transferred from one department to another (I even received a blank response to one set of queries), and it took me nearly a year to find answers to even the most basic questions. Many RTI activists advised me to persist with appeals until I got what I was looking for. And I did. We filed appeals, appeared in person, wrote letters and cited legal points, until the answers trickled in slowly. And then I hit jackpot. I was granted audience to a 155-page report that was essentially an exchange between several senior government officials and the CAG, exchanging blame, denying wrong-doing and trying to evade responsibility. But to get there required great resources (that my privilege accorded me with, and which I acknowledge fully) — time, perseverance and, most of all, patience.

By the end of three-and-a-half years, I was staring at information that was heartbreaking. I had lost my home to a flood that was entirely avoidable. So many people lost their lives, livelihoods and homes because those in power dilly-dallied. However, the last four years also taught me that the flood was not made in a day. Also, a single person cannot be held responsible for it. We have been building up to this for decades. We are staring at a ‘Groundhog Day-esque’ future if we don’t act, and press upon our elected officials to act.

Helping hand: The disaster brought people together, but some social divides remained insurmountable. - K V Srinivasan

With Rivers Remember, I am exercising my democratic right to participate in governance. To ask questions, to seek answers, to fix accountability, to count our losses, to acknowledge the largesse of a people who came together, and to understand social divides that are not easy to transcend, especially during a catastrophe.

Writing the book has taken its toll on me in more ways than I can count. I have cried myself to sleep on occasion. It wasn’t just the loneliness and anxiety of writing, finding a publisher or going through the editing process. It also had to do with the kind of stories I was privy to. To the devastation and destruction of so many ways of life. From the small to the big, from the poor to the rich, from the young to the old... the flood may not have affected all of us the same, but it did, nonetheless. It united us in grief even if some of us were unable to see how similar we are even in the face of this tragedy. The realisation that not even a flood could erase the divides of class and caste was numbing.

Washed away: From the small to the big, the poor to the rich, the young to the old, the flood affected everyone. - V V Krishnan

I wouldn’t, however, want anyone to feel hopeless or despair at my story. At my city’s story. Instead, more people should join me in this simple act of taking control; no longer should we wait for disaster to strike at our doorsteps. There are many who care. For our city. For our home.

In the wake of the natural calamity that has affected thousands of people across Kerala, Maharashtra and Karnataka, Samsung has introduced an option for its consumers to contribute to relief measures using their Samsung smartphones.

Samsung consumers can now contribute directly to the Chief Minister’s Flood Relief Fund using Samsung Pay and Samsung Pay Mini. Samsung’s drive to create awareness on the issue and provide a platform for consumers to contribute towards the relief measures is aimed at supporting the rehabilitation efforts of respective state governments. Within Samsung Pay, users can easily find the options CM’s Flood Relief Fund, making the donation experience hassle free and just a click away.

“We encourage our consumers to come forward to extend their support to those affected by the floods. At Samsung, we believe in creating meaningful innovations that transform people’s lives. Using Samsung Pay and Samsung Pay Mini, consumers can now make donations through a simple swipe on their smartphones,” said Sanjay Razdan, Senior Director, Service and Monetization, Samsung India.

In the past, Samsung has undertaken numerous initiatives to contribute to society. Some of these initiatives include ‘Care for J&K’ and ‘Care for Chennai’ wherein Samsung employees donated to the Prime Ministers Relief Fund for J&K and for relief during the Chennai floods.

In 2018, Samsung India also deployed its Customer Service Vans that helped in setting up a relief camp in Kerala, as part of its efforts to reach out to persons affected by the floods. Extending help towards the cause, Samsung employees across the country, including at its R&D centres in Noida and Bengaluru and two factories, in Noida and Sriperumbudur near Chennai joined the initiative to make a voluntary contribution for people of Kerala. Through this initiative, Samsung India had pledged to contribute INR 1.5 crore to the Kerala Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF) alongside donating 10,000 bedding sets to the people of the state.

Samsung Pay is a mobile payment and digital wallet service by Samsung Electronics that lets users make payments using compatible phones.

The large-scale damage to coconut groves in the wake of cyclone Gaja in the delta districts in December has prompted the government to issue the directive to hire drones well ahead of the northeast monsoon.In a circular, the government said collectors should finalize the hiring charges well in advance and ensure availability of the drones. When there is large-scale damage, these drones should be engaged immediately for date and geo-tagging while capturing the images. “This will be useful to show the extent of damage to the visiting Central teams as well as the state teams. It will indicate the type of interventions required and mobilisation of support from outside or locally, besides the relief package to the affected areas. The drones open a new world,” revenue administration and disaster management commissioner K Satyagopal said. The aerial photographs supported the state’s request for Gaja cyclone relief, when it made a detailed presentation before a Parliamentary committee on finance in New Delhi in December.On Monday, the state disaster management authority, led by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami took stock of monsoon preparedness in Tamil Nadu and issued slew of directions for speedy relief and restoration. At least 6,606 policemen, including 607 in Chennai, trained with state and national disaster response force are stationed in all the districts. “An exclusive battalion has been raised with 1,000 personnel for a dedicated state disaster response force. This is on a par with NDRF. The dedicated force will not only look after monsoon related disasters, but will be trained for all natural and man-made ones too, such as building collapses and nuclear disasters. Their primary responsibility is handling multiple disaster response,” Satyagopal said.The chief minister directed the chief secretary to hold a review meeting with three armed forces, central and state government departments and monitoring officers in the rank of IAS officers to visit the districts from the first week of October and assess the preparation with the check lists. The government machinery identified 4,399 vulnerable areas in the state, and set up 662 zonal inter-departmental teams, and 30,759 first responders to take up relief work. The CM sanctioned Rs 38.52 crore to the SDRF, to purchase special equipment, Rs 7.25 crore to the Greater Chennai Corporation and Rs 1 crore to the fisheries department to buy NavIC and NavTEX devices to convey distress messages to fishermen.

Dried-out taps, shutting down of schools, restaurants and hotels running out of business, police protection for protecting water resources, water being transported by train and tankers are not isolated events taking place in faraway places but are increasingly taking place almost every year in our neighbourhoods.

When situations like these strike an affluent and mega city, as it did in 2017-18 in Cape Town, they made headlines, bringing attention to the unfolding urban water crisis globally. Post Cape Town, multiple articles/reports pointed out the impending and existing water crisis for many Indian cities.

This year, it was Chennai that ran out of water.

The Chennai metropolitan area (CMA) — consisting of Chennai city, with a population of 4.9 million, and its adjoining areas — has an estimated population of 8.6 million and is the fourth-largest urban conglomerate in India.

Chennai was in the news four years ago for an entirely opposite reason but an equally serious situation — the unprecedented floods of December 2015, that drowned the city for many days, devastating lives and impacting businesses.

This year, the reservoirs that overflowed during the 2015-16 floods, dried out. Of Chennai's total requirement of 830 MLD (million litres a day) water, the Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewage Board(CMWSSB) was able to supply only about 525 MLD during the worst days of the crisis.

Empty reservoirs

The city of Chennai has four major reservoirs/lakes: Poondi, Cholavaram, Redhills and Chembarambakkam. These supply about 200 MLD of water. They fill up at the end of the Northeast monsoon (October-November) and supply water till the next monsoon season.

Post the 2015-16 season, the monsoon has been in deficit for two out of three years, with last year's monsoon deficit being ~ 40 per cent. Due to a deficit monsoon this year, the reservoirs did not get filled up, bringing their combined storage to almost zero.

On June 30, 2019, the combined storage stood at just 18 million cubic feet (mcft) (0.1 per cent of total storage of 11,257 mcft). Last year, on the same day, the storage was 2,245 mcft. With a couple of months still left to go before rainfall, Chennai is in for a hard time in the coming months.

Chennai's vanishing groundwater

Groundwater is extracted extensively, both within and outside Chennai city limits, to meet the city's water demands. The CMWSSB and private tanker suppliers extract groundwater from rural areas on the outskirts of Chennai and transport it via tankers.

Within city limits, groundwater extraction takes place from about 0.42 million private groundwater wells, with 66 per cent of households having their own private wells. The result is overexploitation, with the city extracting almost twice the annual recharge.

Limited recharge due to the deficit monsoon and long-term indiscriminate groundwater extraction is making water tables fall rapidly, leading to wells drying up, deteriorating water quality and the risk of saline sea water ingress requiring well deepening or the search for wells further away from the city.

Dependence on tankers

Tankers supplying groundwater from outside the city limits are Chennai's lifeline. At the height of the crisis, there were about 700-900 CMSSWB tankers making 9,700 trips, two-three times the usual trips to compensate for loss of supply from reservoirs, supplying about ~ 100 MLD of water and 4,500-5,000 private tankers, making five-six trips daily, supplying ~ 200 MLD.

However, groundwater overexploitation was made worse by limited recharge this year. It led to conflicts and tensions brewing up in and around the surrounding urban-rural areas, where many people were against indiscriminate groundwater mining in their area, forcing tankers to travel longer distances.

Inequity of impacts

With most of the city’s water supply dependent on water tankers, the impact of the water crisis this year was disproportionately felt by the poor. A 9,000-litre tanker from CMWSSB cost Rs 700-Rs 800, whereas private companies charged Rs 4,000-Rs 5,000.

With demand outstripping supply, the waiting period for tankers from CMSSWB stood at 15-25 days. High prices and low availability of public tankers made water access unaffordable for the people living in slums and lower income societies. The cost of buying water for many came to almost half of their monthly income.

Bad planning or limit of resilience?

After the drought of 2000, Chennai made it mandatory for buildings to have rainwater harvesting systems (RWH) installed. Rainwater harvesting did initially help to increase recharge and improving water tables.

However, there are concerns that over the years, poor implementation and lack of maintenance had led to many of these RWH systems becoming dysfunctional. With the water crisis on its doorstep now, city utilities have started a drive to check the efficiency of rainwater harvesting and install more.

RWH alone can do little when unregulated encroachments, illegal construction and indiscriminate pumping is pushing the city to limits. Due to rapid urbanisation and encroachment, the number of water bodies in Chennai have reduced to 28 (2017) from 60 (1893) and area under these water bodies has shrunk from 12.6 sq km to just 3.2 sq km, significantly affecting the city’s capacity to recharge depleted groundwater.

Chennai currently has two desalination plants supplying 200 MLD. After the current crisis, work on another desalination plant has been initiated that would supply 150 MLD at a cost of 1,259 crore by 2021, with a plan to add another of 400 MLD capacity.

Would these heavy investments save the city? Many believe that in a city with more than 1,000 mm rainfall, expensive desalination plants consuming lots of energy with negative environmental externalities might not be the best answer.

The financial sustainability of desalination plants is also in question, with utilities spending Rs 45-50 per 1,000 litre to produce potable water but charging Rs 3-5 from consumers.

Way forward

The 2019 crisis is a wake-up call for Chennai and other cities in India. With cities being the powerhouse of the economy, much more is required to make them sustainable and livable.

Integrated urban water management is the need of the hour, with no single effort or intervention being able to achieve long-term resilience. Within city limits, efforts should be put into rejuvenating its existing and lost water bodies, properly installing and managing rainwater harvesting systems and increasing the reuse of treated water.

With much of Chennai's sources of water lying outside city limits, efforts need to be put in place to secure reservoir catchments, recharge groundwater and build partnerships with farmers and stakeholders. Otherwise, conflicts over water sources would keep increasing.

Time is running out and there is an urgent need to act now on conserving water.

Rainwater harvesting did initially help to increase recharge and improving water tables. However, there are concerns that over the years, poor implementation and lack of maintenance had led to many of these RWH systems becoming dysfunctional. With the water crisis on its doorstep now, city utilities have started a drive to check the efficiency of rainwater harvesting and install more. RWH alone can do little when unregulated encroachments, illegal construction and indiscriminate pumping is pushing the city to limits. Due to rapid urbanisation and encroachment, the number of water bodies in Chennai have reduced to 28 (2017) from 60 (1893) and area under these water bodies has shrunk from 12.6 sq km to just 3.2 sq km, significantly affecting the city’s capacity to recharge depleted groundwater.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The Central government has given its nod for a comprehensive flood mitigation project and has recommended it to the World Bank for loan assistance. The project that is expected to take off in six months will help reduce the vulnerability of several localities to floods in different river basins, including lower Palar, Araniyar, and Kosasthalaiyar.

Additional storage of nearly 4.76 thousand million cubic feet will also be created to cater to the drinking water needs of the city. Various structures, including check dams, recharge wells and sub-surface dykes, will be constructed in rivers as part of the project, to enhance groundwater recharge and storage. Besides construction of these new structures, riverine reservoirs will also be built in major waterways, including the Adyar river, at a cost of ₹80 crore.

Three biowaste treatment plants to come up in the city

The Greater Chennai Corporation will call for tenders soon to set up three bio-gas CNG plants in the city. The plants that will be in public-private partnership will be set up at Pallikkaranai, Shollinganallur and Annanagar at a cost of Rs 9.3 crore. For dry waste, the corporation has planned incinerators at Manali, Madhavaram and Thiruvottiyur. 55% of the 5500 tonnes of waste generated every day in the city is wet waste.

Temperature soars, but water woes likely to ease

Chennai has started witnessing rise in temperature yet again. The Met department has ruled out possible rains in the city in the immediate, and has forecast an increase in day temperature.

However, the city might get relief from the water woes as the Veeranam lake, the main source of water for the city, is likely to get more water. With Karnataka releasing Cauvery water, Mettur dam has seen an increase in water levels, following which the water from Mettur dam is expected to reach Veeranam Lake soon.

This comes as welcome relief after reports that the water level at the Veeranam lake was fast falling and could be expected to last only for the next 20 days.

Chennai to become the first to use treated sewage water for industries

When the Kodungaiyur treatment plant becomes operational this week, Chennai will earn the distinction of being the first city in the country to use treated sewage water for industrial purpose. Once the plant is commissioned, the freshwater saved will be supplied to residential areas in Tiruvottiyur, Tondiarpet, Royapuram, Madhavaram and Manali in the North, and Chintadripet, Purasawalkam, Egmore, T Nagar, and Mambalam in the central part of the city. The plant in Kodungaiyur will initially treat 15 MLD, which will slowly be increased to 35 MLD, and then to its full capacity of 45 MLD. Another treatment plant is under construction in Koyambedu, and will become operational in September. Together, these two plants can treat upto 90 million litres of sewage per day.

Given the river's mood, the possibility of the water reaching there wasn't completely out of question. A newspaper alarmingly predicted that the Rashtrapati Bhawan too would be flooded. But it, and the sanctum sanctorum of Indian democracy, remained safe. What didn't was, Jehangirpuri, a slum located far-off in North Delhi, where houses were submerged and only rooftops pimpled the landscape.

Its residents, nearly 1.5 lakh in number, flocked out as water level rose alarmingly. Some stubbornly stayed back to salvage their belongings, only to find themselves marooned on their crumbling rooftops because Yamuna's whooshing water was unsparing. As panic-stricken people started taking shelter elsewhere, loot became common in the locality, which was set up on the floodplains of Yamuna during the Emergency.

For days to come, filth and stench blanketed Jehangirpuri. Its people were living their scariest nightmares with their lives turned topsy-turvy. Floods weren't alien to them but this scale was.

The year was 1978 and the month September. It was the time of the year when monsoon is generally at its fag end. Agricultural fields, especially in the Indo-Gangetic plains, are lush with paddy, drenched sufficiently in monsoon showers; people by now have had enough respite from the scorching sun; headlines on vector-borne diseases dot newspapers; and in Delhi, the temperature hovers around 30 degrees Celsius while the air is irritatingly humid, but bearable.

In India, floods in September are rare; massive ones, even rarer. On the contrary, this is a month when floodwaters start receding everywhere. But in September 1978, the floods broke previous records and set many that remain to be broken.

""Bearing all barriers and records of nearly a century, the rivers of North India conspired with the monsoon to erode signs of civilisation. Sweeping through the state of Haryana, sections of the capital city of Delhi, and through the landscape of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, the fury of flood spelt death, destruction and disease,"" was how the September 1978 cover story of India Today magazine started its reportage on the calamity.

Overall, the 1978 floods affected an area of 17.5 million hectares across the country - highest in the last 65 years. The floods also claimed 3,396 human lives and 23,9174 cattle, besides damaging 35,07,542 houses and affecting 70.450 million people.

1978: NOT AN OUTLIER

While 1978 bore witness to a catastrophe, it wasn't the lone year to do so. A year earlier, India had suffered 11,316 deaths - the highest between 1953 and 2017 - and a year later, the country witnessed the highest deaths of cattle i.e. 6,18,248.

Travelling through the corridor of time over the past decades, one finds that its walls were regularly imprinted with calamities like the one India weathered in 1978. Some were of similar magnitude, others far more catastrophic.

You need not travel far in your mind's eye to recall the harrowing images of storeys of concrete buildings being washed away like decks of cards in the violent waters of Mandakini and Alaknanda (tributaries of the Ganga) in Uttarakhand in 2013.

The month was June and the Char Dham Yatra (an annual pilgrimage to the Hindu shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri) was at its peak in the mountains.

It was a year when death and destruction literally poured in from the skies in 'Devbhoomi' (the adobe of Gods) as Uttarakhand is commonly known.

A double whammy of incessant rain and melting of a massive glacial lake just above the temple town of Kedarnath made Himalayan streams swell into seas of fast-flowing water. Their wailing torrents swept, buried and destroyed anything and everything that came in their way.

Left behind were lives prickled with needles of uncertainties and a plundered terrain where life once marinated in the hotchpotch of everyday mundaneness.

If 2013 is too far to travel back, one may also recollect the visuals of widespread devastation in Kerala during the monsoon downpour of 2018, a year when the state suffered its worst disaster in 100 years.

This year too, floods have wreaked havoc in Assam, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Bihar, among others states. More than 200 people have died in rain-related tragedies across the country and damages to property runs into thousands of crores.

TIMES CHANGE BUT SOME THINGS DON'T

India's political spectrum has undergone rapid transition over the last 65 years. Governments changed, leaders rose and fell, parties were formed and exterminated, issues and priorities too saw a sea of change, but what remains an eyesore is that despite their annual nature, floods continue to maim states, claim hundreds of lives and ravage valuable resources.

Whether it is Assam and Arunachal Pradesh in the Northeast, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh in the Gangetic plains, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and J&K in the hills, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in Central India or the southern states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the story is the same.

Geographically, India is located in a zone that is climatically very sensitive and bears a heavy population burden. It is one of the countries where the impact of global warming and climate change can be seen and measured tangibly. The rapidly melting Himalayan glaciers and the receding shorelines of islands in the Sundarbans are ready-to-refer examples.

Overall, it is estimated that 40 million hectares of land (roughly 12 per cent of India's geographical area) is prone to floods. While floods occur in India every year, data for the last 65 years show that the scale of their impact, in terms of area affected and damage caused, has been erratic.

SCALE OF DESTRUCTION

When data on damages suffered in floods in the past 65 years stare at you, there appears to be little difference in how India's richest and poorest, developed and 'Bimaru' states prepare for and work after floods. Everywhere it is a story of death and misery that repeats year after year.

Between 1953 and 2017, India suffered damages worth Rs 37,82,47,04,70,000 (Rs 3,78,247.047 crore) due to floods and heavy rains. Besides this, 1,07,535 people were killed, a total of 8,07,17,993 houses destroyed and an area of 466.335 million hectare affected.

For farmers, the overall damage to crops was Rs 1,11,225.621 crore (nearly 30 per cent of the total damages) and 60,49,349 cattle dead.

In terms of damages suffered in floods and heavy rain, the year 2015 was the most catastrophic for India. Data from the Central Water Commission show that the country's total loss due to floods in 2015 was Rs 57,291.1 crore. Of this, 45 per cent (Rs 25,912.51 crore) was in Tamil Nadu alone.

The winter of 2015 was one that people of Chennai will remember for many years, but for the wrong reasons. It was a year when within a few days Chennai was flooded at a scale never seen in the past 100 years.

The city came to a standstill as its residents were stranded in their homes. That winter, rainfall in Chennai was nearly three times the normal level. Some estimated that it was the world's eighth most expensive disaster in 2015.

CHANGING NATURE OF DAMAGE

If we look at the year-wise damages suffered in the past 65 years, we find that the scale of destruction has increased exponentially in the last two decades (see chart below).

The chart shows that since early 2000s, the overall damages suffered due to floods and heavy rains have increased rapidly - years like 2015, 2017, 2013, 2009, 2006 and 2010 all saw damages exceeding Rs 19,000 crore.

These damages include damage to crops, houses and public properties. Analysing the data, we find that in the past 65 years, the contribution of losses due to damages to crop, houses and public property have changed significantly.

Between 1953 and 1982, the loss suffered due to damaged crop was the biggest contributor to India's flood-related losses. For example, in 1953, damage to crop was estimated at Rs 42.08 crore while the damage to public property was just Rs 2.9 crore. The damage to public property was even lower than the damage to houses (Rs 7.42 crore).

But this changed from the 1980s onwards, when the share of loss due to damaged crop was overtaken by the loss due to damages of public property (see chart). Between 1983 and 1992, India's loss due to damaged crop in floods was Rs 11,773.37 crore, but the loss due to damaged public property was Rs 12,546.16 crore.

Over the years, this difference widened and between 2013 and 2017, the loss India suffered due to public property damaged in floods was 112 per cent more than that suffered due to damaged crop.

One of the likely factors responsible for this shift over the years is the increasing urbanisation in India and migration of people from rural areas to urban centres in search of job and better opportunities.

Besides this, as the Indian economy strengthened over the years (resulting in increase in people's incomes and living standards), the size of Indian cities also increased manifolds. But while cities became larger, the flood management and drainage systems failed to catch up with the need of the hour.

The best examples for this mismatch is the plight of India's four metropolitan cities - New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata - during monsoon every year. Despite being India's four most important cities, every year newspapers are splashed with images of these cities heavily flooded during monsoon rains. Deaths, destruction and agony have become the sad reality for these urban giants, despite their corridors of power and lanes of skyscrapers.

DOES WIDESPREAD FLOOD MEAN WIDESPREAD DAMAGE?

Another aspect of floods-related damages in India is that the total area affected by floods and the total damages suffered may not necessarily tell the same story. Flood data for the past 65 years dispels the perception that years that saw widespread floods (in terms of area affected) were also the years when damages were the most.

In 2006, the area affected by floods in India was 1.09 million hectare. This was the lowest in the 65 years between 1953 and 2017. But the total damages suffered in 2006 were to the tune of Rs 19,790.922 -- one of the highest amounts during these years. On the other hand, in 1978, an area of 17.5 million hectare was affected by floods - the highest. But the damages suffered were Rs 1,454.76 crore, a relatively smaller figure.

Similarly, flood-related damages in 2015 were estimated at Rs 57,291.09 crore - the highest in 65 years - but the number of people killed (1,420) was far less than 1977 when 11,316 people died in floods and heavy rains.

Thus, what this indicates is:

1) The damage caused by floods in a given year need not necessarily be dependent on how widespread the floods are.

2) Years which claim more lives need not necessarily be the years that suffer maximum damages.

3) Since the 1980s, the share of loss due to damaged crop in floods has significantly decreased in comparison to the share of loss due to damaged public property.

THE TIMES AHEAD

Given the fact that India is among the countries most affected by global warming and climate change, scientists have predicted that floods and drought will become more frequent in India. The data for the last 65 years support this assertion and show that the area affected by floods in India does not follow any pattern.

One year you may see widespread floods, while the next year the situation may be the complete opposite.

Example: In 1978, an area of 17.5 million hectare was affected by floods. A year later, the affected area was only 3.99 million hectare. In 1988, an area of 16.29 million hectare was affected, but a year later it was 8.06 million hectare and in 1992, it was just 2.65 million hectare. Closer to today, 2014 saw an area of 12.78 million hectare being affected by flood but a year earlier, the figure was just 2.14 million hectare. (More details in chart.)

Besides the monsoon rains and occasional cyclone-induced rains, the melting of Himalayan glaciers is a major source of flood in India. With the rapid increase of global temperatures coupled with incidents of forest fires in the Himalayan slopes becoming more regular and intense, glaciers have started melting at an alarming rate. This increases the total volume of water in the rivers, which becomes catastrophic, especially when monsoon-laden clouds reach the Northern plains and hit the Himalayas.

The most recent and devastating example of the two flood-inducing factors merging in this manner is the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy in Uttarakhand. Incessant monsoon rains aside, the disaster was aggravated by the sudden melting of the massive Chorabari Glacier, just above Kedarnath.

According to the World Bank, ""India is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change. It has one of the highest densities of economic activity in the world, and very large numbers of poor people who rely on the natural resource base for their livelihoods, with a high dependence on rainfall.""

In a recent paper published in Current Science, scientists from India Meteorological Department, National Geophysical Research Institute and National Disaster Management Agency, among others, reiterated that global warming is resulting in increased extreme rainfall in India.

""In recent decades, warming trend over the Indian Ocean has potentially enhanced moisture supply leading to rainfall extremes in the country,"" the paper said. The researchers said abrupt variability and increased uncertainty in rainfall patterns pose ""ever-increasing risk"" of flood disaster in India.

While these figures and studies give us a sense of the tragedies that people in India weather every year, they do not convey the emotional trauma and mental agony people suffered, suffer and will continue to suffer unless things change.

For instance, in August this year, researchers at Madras University in a study found that schoolchildren who witnessed the 2015 Chennai floods showed symptoms of anxiety and were found to be ""mentally traumatised"". The researchers also found that children from areas that were severely flooded showed increased symptoms of trauma.

As India stares and embarks into a future of climatic uncertainty, what remains certain is that death and destruction due to floods will continue to maim the country unless it finds a far-sighted flood management mechanism.

Data such as the one presented above may shock you, but the shock of seeing a loved one swept away in flood water, get buried in a landslide, or die suffering from disease that follow floods is far more shocking and painful. It can be only be felt. Numbers are numbers, they scream but don't feel.

RECAP OF WHAT FLOODS HAVE COST INDIA

The total flood-related damage in the past 65 years is estimated to be Rs 37,82,47,04,70,000.

At least 1,07,535 people and 60,49,349 cattle were killed.

A total of 8,07,17,993 houses were destroyed and an area of 466.335 million hectare affected.

The disastrous floods of 2015 and the Ennore oil spill stand out in the list. In addition, the city’s air and water have become more polluted than ever before.

The city’s garbage has continued to remain a threat to the environment and health of the people living in the city.

Through Amirtharaj Stephen’s lens, Mongabay-India takes a look at Chennai’s environment over the last five years.

Since the 2014 national elections, the capital city of Tamil Nadu has witnessed major environmental calamities, from the disastrous floods of December 2015 to the giant oil spill outside Kamarajar Port at Ennore in early 2017. Apart from these distinct events, the vast expanse of Chennai metropolitan area has seen an increase in pollution – both of water bodies that serve the city’s seven million population and the ambient air.

When the floods struck in December 2015, the most iconic images were those of Chennai’s famed beaches lined with mountains of trash. Waste such as plastic materials, wrappers, bottles, covers, metals, scrap and wooden logs were spread out on display along the coastline of the Bay of Bengal in Chennai, across Marina and Elliot’s beaches.

More than a year later, during the early hours on January 28, 2017, there was a giant oil spill outside Kamarajar port, when the outbound B.W. Maple collided with an inbound tanker Dawn Kanchipuram. A total of 251.46 tonnes of black, sticky oil coated the Ennore coast.

Reports state that the oil spill was removed largely by the hand, with more than 2000 volunteers and labourers using mugs and buckets. However, the damage remained toxic, killing olive ridley turtles and other marine fauna on Chennai’s beaches.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
235,774,chennai,2019,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/145703/unusual-monsoon-season-causes-flooding-in-india,7 Oct 2019,Unusual Monsoon Season Causes Flooding in India,"India’s 2019 monsoon season has been one of the most unusual in recent decades. From June to September 2019, India received the highest amount of monsoonal rain in the past 25 years. According to the India Meteorological Department, those rains are not expected to retreat until at least October 10, which would be the latest withdrawal of the monsoon in the country’s recorded history.

The monsoon usually accounts for around 70 percent of India’s annual rainfall, but the surplus this year has caused major hardship. According to local media, floods this year have displaced or injured at least 2.5 million people in 22 states and killed several thousand.

The most recently affected area is the state of Bihar in eastern India. In just a few days in late September, extreme rainfall covered many areas with knee-deep water. The images above show the flooding around the Ganges River in Bihar. The left image was acquired on October 2, 2018, and the right on October 7, 2019. Both images were acquired by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite.

The monsoon season started slow. In June 2019, much of India endured major heatwaves related to sparse spring rainfall and a late arrival of monsoon rains. By August and September, however, many regions were experiencing above average rain. In total, a national average of 97 centimeters (38 inches) of rain fell this year from June 1 to September 30, which is 110 percent of the norm and the most since 1994. (Average annual rainfall from 1951–2000 was 88 centimeters, or 35 inches.) It is important to note that while many portions of India have received a lot of rain, some regions have actually experienced a rainfall deficit.

Much of the rain in 2019 was caused by an increased number of low-pressure systems. News reports state that the country experienced more extreme rainfall events this year compared to last year. Scientists believe the increased rain events could be associated with a phenomenon known as the Indian Ocean Dipole, when the western and eastern parts of the Indian Ocean are different temperatures. When the western portion is warmer than the eastern portion (as it was this summer), the region experiences a stronger monsoon rainfall.

The India Meteorological Department predicts the monsoon will start withdrawing about a month later than usual. Researchers attribute the delay to unusual patterns in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a region of weather centered around the equator where trade winds from the northern and southern hemispheres meet. Usually by September 1, temperatures decrease and the ITCZ moves south of India. However, temperatures have remained warm in the northern hemisphere, and ITCZ weather patterns have lingered longer than normal.

236,775,chennai,2019,https://india.mongabay.com/2019/05/commentary-in-kerala-there-was-nothing-golden-about-this-missed-opportunity/,28 May 2019,[Commentary] In Kerala there was nothing “golden” about this missed opportunity,"The people of Kerala missed an opportunity to introspect about the floods of August 2018, when the Sabarimala temple controversy erupted a month after the extreme weather event.

The controversy was expected to help the Bharatiya Janata Party to strengthen their vote base for the national elections, but the National Democratic Alliance could not win a parliamentary seat from the state.

With climate change, events such as the August 2018 floods could become more frequent, and thus learning lessons from past events can help in dealing with future ones.

The city of Chennai and the surrounding areas went through major floods in November-December 2015. The entire state of Kerala went through a similar event in August 2018. Both the events were almost like a once in a 100 years event. In Kerala, the last such severe floods was in 1924. Chennai had had many severe floods, but this was the worst in terms of intensity and damage to lives and property.

The Chennai event was a milestone, not just for the city and its surroundings, but even for other parts of the country. It was the first time when people innovated and developed impromptu methods of communication and mutual support. It was perhaps the earliest event where social media and digital communication was improvised and used effectively to deal with the situation.

For instance, from the time of Chennai floods more and more people have been turning to an amateur meteorologist Pradeep John’s social media posts, who goes by the name Tamil Nadu Weatherman, to know what their weather will be in the next days and even hours. John has a day job in a Tamil Nadu Government institution, and specialises in giving micro-level forecasts which are of more practical value to his readers than the week-long and generic forecasts from the India Meteorological Department.

Similarly, digital map maker Arun Ganesh teamed with a colleague and developed a street-level map of Chennai that incorporated crowd-sourced information about what roads are inundated, by how much, and where to find relief camps. The map went live on December 1, 2015. Not only were residents able to avoid the most dangerous flood zones, the city learned which areas were the first to flood and to what depth. Crowd-sourced flooding information was reported from 15,000 road segments, and in the two weeks of its launch, it had registered 1.2 million views.

There were many other such initiatives. Social media was used extensively to link those who needed to be rescued to official rescuers. Food was reached to who needed it the most. An IAS officer from Tamil Nadu, turned a governmental call centre in Bengaluru to coordinate relief calls. Young volunteers from Tamil Nadu working in Bengaluru’s information technology industry manned the call centre, so that they could communicate seamlessly in Tamil.

It was the Chennai model that Kerala adopted when it faced equally devastating floods in August 2018. Social media teams worked with district authorities and others to rescue and to reach relief material. Working together, Kerala overcame the crisis in as effective a manner it was possible under the circumstances.

However, the similarities between Chennai and Kerala ended with the crisis. While Chennai discussed the floods continuously for months in the public mind space, Kerala’s discussions were hijacked to a polarising discussion on whether women of menstruating age should enter the Sabarimala temple or not.

The Supreme Court judgement changed it all

Coming close on the heels of the floods, on September 28, 2018, the Supreme Court struck down the rule in the Sabarimala temple that disallowed women in the menstruating age between 10 and 50 years from entering the temple premises. The judgement created a social media controversy and conflict in Kerala that continued for months. It is only in February 2019 that the controversy eased out and the space was taken over by other discussions.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led the protests against the judgement and its feared implementation from the front. P.S. Sreedharan Pillai, the state leader of the BJP was reported to have called it a “golden opportunity” for the party. The aim was to use the issue to consolidate the vote base of the party in Kerala. The BJP had not yet sent a parliamentarian from the state, and it was only in the 2016 state assembly elections that it had got one seat.

However, the BJP’s campaigning did not result in a parliamentary seat this year. The increase in vote share of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) made in Kerala was 4.35 percent. It increased from 10.85 percent in 2014 to 15.20 percent in 2019 (12.9 percent for the BJP). Its highest vote share was in Thiruvananthapuram (31.3 percent), Pathanamthitta (28.97 percent) and Thrissur (28.2 percent). The NDA came second in only one of the 20 constituencies of the state.

For nearly five months, the Sabarimala issue dominated the public, media, policy and administrative mindscape in Kerala, and the NDA did not benefit enough in votes to show for it. On the other hand, the cost that state had to pay is that it missed the opportunity to discuss threadbare the lessons from the August 2018 floods and how to plan for a similar eventuality in the future. With protests and confrontation ever so often in the open, the administrative machinery spent time, money and energy that could have been used to reconstruct the state after the floods.

Why is truth and reconciliation necessary for building climate resilience?

There were two reasons that Kerala was badly hit during the floods. The last time that such an excessive rain happened was in 1924, nearly a century ago. There was no collective memory about the event. Two, Kerala had taken its ability to deal with high rainfall for granted. With an annual average of above 2,800 mm the state was used to rain falling copiously and the water flowing into the streams and rivers without an incident.

The once-in-a-century event found the state unprepared, and the cumulative flow of water from the rains and the opening of dams was more than what the natural drainage could handle. The prognosis from climate change analysis, like that from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Extreme Events (IPCC-SREX) and Assessment Report 5 (IPCC-AR5) is that the return time of such events will become lesser than 100 years. So the once in a century events like that of 2018 and 1924 may happen once in 30 or even 25 years.

To deal with future events, it is necessary to understand, analyse and introspect on the past events. Time is needed for that. In the immediate aftermath of an event, it is a blame game, with everybody accusing the other of omissions and commissions – “you did this” or “you didn’t do this on time” dominating the discussions.

It takes a few months for these discussions to mature into collective consensus and action plans. That is when the deeper questions get asked. What have we been doing to our environment so that it alternates between floods and drought frequently? Despite such heavy rains why did all the water bodies dry immediately after the floods? Was there a dam management process in place in August 2018? If no, what can be done to make it happen? Is there a crisis management plan, and how can lessons from 2018 make it more effective? Does the state know where it is going in terms of climate change? How effective is the state’s action plan on climate change?

The opportunity to discuss these questions was lost due to the Sabarimala dispute. Ironically, the temple itself is a hill shrine set inside the Periyar Tiger Reserve in Pathanamthitta district. With the Pampa river flowing close by the area was affected badly during the floods. The Pampa also flooded the midlands and coastal plains as it flowed towards the Arabian Sea.

The Sabarimala temple is located inside the ecologically-sensitive environment of the Periyar Tiger Reserve. The Pampa river downhill had flooded and caused problems during the floods. Map from Google.

Truth and reconciliation is not only a political process that helps a society clear out its hurt as it recovers from a history of turmoil, but it can also help a society to deal with the trauma of an extreme weather event. Lessons learnt with one event can be used to prevent some of the disastrous consequences in future events.

If Odisha could restrict the loss of lives during Cyclone Fani it was because of the lessons the state had learnt over repeated cyclonic events of the past. And this collective knowledge becomes an important component in developing climate resilience in a community. The non-formal information networks that the people of Chennai innovated during the floods were used again when two oil-tanker ships collided off the coast of Ennore in January 2017, and the civil society joined in to clean the oil that spilled on to the city coast.

Even as the election results were coming out on May 23, overcast skies over Kerala indicated that the southwest monsoon was not far away. As the final numbers came in by the evening, the “golden opportunity” was a non-starter politically, but it also signified a missed opportunity to have developed a framework for climate resilience in Kerala.

The urban sprawl continues to occupy more space and, in the process, waterbodies shrink. With increasing population density and monsoons going awry, cities find themselves heading towards water-related crises.

The city, which teeters between floods and droughts, continues to lose out on its water resources due to mismanaged urbanisation and encroachments. The systematic destruction of waterbodies comes in the wake of the massive 2015 floods and years of drought thereafter.

The most recent case being Thamaraikeni lake, Sholinganallur, which has shrunk in size from 152 acres to 26 acres. The lake remains vulnerable as a portion of it has been reclassified in terms of land use to put up a police station.

This is one of the many waterbodies in and around the city that are being slowly destroyed by the urban sprawl. According to the audit report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, 2017, the built-up area in the Chennai metropolitan area has grown from 90.88 sq. km. in 1979, to 541.14 sq. km. in 2016. On the other hand, the water spread area of lakes and ponds has shrunk from 100.98 sq. km to 91.31 sq. km. in the past 40 years.

HOW TO READ THE IMAGES & GRAPHS

In each satellite image below, the area marked in red points to the extent of that lake in 1973 and the waterbody below depicts the actual lake extent as of 2018. The roads that criss-cross and the buildings built over the red area were once part of the lake which were later enroached upon. The graph below the maps shows the extent of select waterbodies* in 1954 and 2016. For instance, the Pallikaranai wetlands have shrunk from 15,000 acres in 1954 to just 1,500 acres in 2016.

Key to recharge

Protection of waterbodies plays a key role in sustaining groundwater recharge and preventing urban flooding, note experts. Jayaram Venkatesan, convener of Arappor Iyakkam, a non-governmental organisation, said many lakes also faced the threat of ‘legalised encroachments’ with reclassification of land use. He claimed that the State government did not have the authority to reclassify land use of waterbodies.“Lakes are major rainwater harvesting structures, and need to be classified as ecological hotspots. Several of them continue to be sewage cesspools. The Tamil Nadu Protection of Tanks and Eviction of Encroachments Act, 2007, that emphasises demarcation of boundaries and eviction of encroachments, has not been implemented effectively,” he added.

Though the integrated Cooum River Eco-restoration Project is on, tackling sewage pollution in the waterway remains a major challenge. Sources in the Water Resources Department note that the river in city limits continues to receive industrial effluents and sewage in several areas such as Greams Road and Chintadripet.The department has nearly finished work of desilting the waterway in the city.

But, restoration is not complete without plugging of sewage outfalls. Experts note that building sewage treatment plants along the river bund will only be an immediate solution and will not help in arresting new sewage outfalls. There is a need for concerted efforts by the government and people to save the city’s waterways.Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswami on Thursday announced in the State Assembly that a comprehensive policy would be formulated for use of recycled water in industries and prevention of pollution of waterbodies.

Recycled water

Recycled water is indeed the solution to creating a resilient and drought-free water supply scenario, said experts. L. Elango, professor, Department of Geology, Anna University, said in hydrogeological terms, Chennai is not the best location for groundwater overextraction. Pollution of rivers would lead to groundwater contamination in adjacent areas.“We need a multi-pronged approach to reduce water stress — restoration of waterbodies, augmentation of surface water partly with release of treated sewage into rivers and use of recyled water,” he said. Citing an Anna University study, he said recycled water could contribute to nearly 30% of the city‘s water needs by 2030.

In a bid to tackle apathy towards waterbodies, the State government must form a lake development authority with a dedicated force to protect waterbodies as rainwater harvesting sources, according to Arun Krishnamurthy, founder, Environmentalist Foundation of India. “Lakes are encroached upon for development of infrastructure too. They must be declared as protected zones and government must invest in creating water literacy and take severe action against offenders,” he added.",issue,Chennai Floods 2015,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city and suburbs,"1,000 mm","Rs. 10,000 crore",464,10 lakh people were displaced,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage, and encroachment of waterbodies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Last year, the Chennai Smart City Mission, sought help from corporate organisations to restore these water bodies, especially ponds, within city corporation limits. With funds from the corporates and the civic body, a few environmental organisations collaborated with citizens to work on the restoration.

This collective effort has yielded some positive outcomes, as a few ponds were revived and the groundwater table has gone up in these areas. “Chennai is bestowed with hundreds of ponds that play a key role in increasing the groundwater table. As ponds are smaller in size, restoring them requires less time than the lakes,” says V Subramani, an environmentalist and founder of Sabari Green Trust.

Two such ponds are Puducherry Keni Kulam and Odaikeni Kulam — in Sholinganallur — both restored by Care Earth Trust, with financial aid from the Rotary Club of Madras, upon the recommendation of Chennai City Connect**.

The Sholinganallur success story

In the midst of busy residential establishments in Sholinganallur, these two ponds, separated by less than a kilometre are markedly different from others in the area. The four sides of their bunds were strengthened and these water bodies present a remarkable change from a year ago when they were filled with water hyacinth, solid waste and silt. The 10.5-hectare Puducherry Keni Kulam was covered by a bed of water hyacinth and polluted by solid waste, while Odaikeni Kulam required desilting.

Behind this radical transformation has been an active citizenry guided by Care Eart Trust. As a first step, the organisation asked the members of resident welfare associations in the area to stop dumping garbage in the ponds. Later, a total of 180 tonnes of water hyacinth was removed from Puducherry Keni Kulam. It was also deepened to 1.5 metres** to increase the water holding capacity.

The 1.5-hectare Odaikeni Kulam demanded less work, as there was no hyacinth. The volunteers de-silted the pond to enable water storage.

“There has been significant transformation. Puducherry Keni Kulam now facilitates the growth of Typha, a wetland plant that indicates good health of the water body. Besides preventing the growth of hyacinth, Typha is used by the local communities for making mats,” says S Vasantharaja, project coordinator of Care Earth Trust.

However, the next step is even more crucial. These water bodies need to be continuously monitored. Care Earth Trust has joined hands with local volunteers who have taken it upon themselves to maintain these restored water bodies. “Whenever any encroachment, or dumping of garbage, or presence of anti-social elements is noticed, I complain to the Assistant Engineer of Sholinganallur zone and Care Earth officials. Protecting water bodies is a full-time job,” says Venkatesh, a local volunteer. During the restoration, Venkatesh played an effective role in motivating volunteers for the cause.

Sholinganallur, an IT hub, has been notorious for flooding, as several high rise buildings have come up on wetlands. By expanding the water holding capacity of the existing water bodies, conditions have been created that may lead to less flooding in the days to come. “Groundwater is available within 25 feet near these ponds now. By restoring the ponds, we have reduced the chances of flooding,” says Jitendra Prasad, a resident, who has set up a monitor by his open well.

Moovarasampet Pond awaits complete restoration

A similar story awaits to be told in South Chennai, where the Moovarasampet Pond never goes dry. Filled with lily and lotus plants, this pond is known for its scenic beauty. But apart from these plants, the one-acre pond was also sieged by perilous water hyacinth rooted deep into the soil.

The Sabari Green Foundation gathered funds from citizens and cleared hyacinth from the pond. “We strengthened the broken compound wall and painted the walls. After clearing the hyacinth, groundwater levels have gone up,” says V Ramarao, a volunteer with Sabari Green Foundation. The Foundation received manpower from Gokul Nagar Resident Welfare Association in Moovarasampet. “It is our way of showing responsibility towards the water bodies. When we clean it ourselves, the message sent out on saving ponds and lakes is stronger,” said Gangadhar P, a resident.

“Water percolation has improved within a radius of three kilometres from the pond. As the groundwater stabilised, over 12,000 people in the locality benefit,” said V Ramarao, after the Sabari Foundation carried out a local impact assessment.

However, due to the shortage of funds, the organisation has had to halt the desilting and construction work on a walking path. Alandur MLA, T M Anbarasan assured Citizen Matters Chennai that funds and manpower would soon be arranged to ensure that the restoration work is completed. As more and more citizens get sensitised thus about the role of water bodies and the advantages they bring, one hopes that more such movements will emerge to save the lakes and ponds of Chennai.

239,778,chennai,2019,https://thewire.in/urban/mumbais-coastal-reclamation-project-the-likelihood-of-a-not-so-natural-disaster,11 Apr 2019,Mumbai's Coastal Reclamation Project – The Likelihood of a Not-So-Natural Disaster,"Two weeks ago, on March 15, a cyclone tore through Beira, Mozambique’s fourth largest city. Cyclone Idai – turbocharged by the climate changed, warmer waters of the Indian Ocean – brought large scale flooding to the region, destroying 90% of Mozambique’s fourth largest city in a matter of two days.

This was just the most recent in a series of now normal superstorms and floods that have ravaged coastal cities like Chennai, New Orleans, Mumbai, New York City, Jakarta, Beira over the last two decades.

As the list of cities reeling from catastrophic floods gets longer, urban planners wonder – where will disaster strike next and what can be done about it?

Writing after Hurricane Katrina, which destroyed over 70% of the city of New Orleans in 2005, Neil Smith insisted that “there is no such thing as a natural disaster”. Disasters, he argued, were the results not just of wind and rains, but the ways in which these interact with urban policy, infrastructure and social vulnerability.

Disasters are created by negligence towards the social and natural contexts of large infrastructure projects. As Mumbai dramatically changes its coastline with the construction of a Rs 12,000-crore coastal road project, a careful review of the project documents suggests that the city may be involved in constructing a massive, not-so-natural disaster in the not too distant future.

The first phase the Mumbai Coastal Road Project, stretching from Marine Drive to Worli, proposes to fill in a total of 90 hectares of land into the sea. On this landfill (also called reclamation), the city proposes, not just to build a road, but also car parking structures, jogging tracks, a bus depot and other amenities.

Built on the coastline, at the interface of land and sea, the landfill will be constructed six meters above the sea level, and will call for the modification of storm water infrastructures that currently empty into the sea. These networks are an important part of the partly functional flood control system of the city.

Yet despite the ways in which Mumbai is already extremely vulnerable to flooding, the city has not as yet conducted a serious study of the ways in which the reclaimed coastline and its road will interact with heavy monsoon rains and rising high tides. Will the coastal road, once complete, exacerbate urban flooding with heavier rains and the displaced, rising sea?

As residents in Mumbai have long known, the city regularly floods when heavy rain showers occur during high tides in the monsoon months. This knowledge is now also amply evident in government reports. For example, a TERI Environmental Status Report, commissioned by the MMRDA in 2015, finds that water logging in the region “is essentially a compounded impact of heavy rainfall and high tides together”.

The 2006 Flood Fact Finding report of the Maharashtra State Government, pointed out floods ensue when “moderate intensity rainfall takes place close to the high tide period”. Finally, the Environmental Impact Assessment of the Coastal Road Project itself stated, “The problem of flooding is acute when heavy rainfall coincides with high tide”, which according to the report is approximately 20 times every monsoon. “If the rain intensity is more than 25 mm per hour and high tide occurs, there is always a possibility of flooding” (Coastal Road Drainage Report).

Yet these reports only detail the present vulnerability of the city to floods. According to a World Bank white paper (2008), the city will experience ever more frequent and intense floods in the near future with climate change. The number of days of intense rainfall in Mumbai have already increased in line with the climate change predictions.

As per the TERI MMRDA report, the number of heavy rain days have increased by 27% and very heavy rain days have increased by 24%. The city will flood more, and more frequently, with the intensification of rainfall.

There is also ample evidence now that the high tides will be higher owing to an accelerating sea level rise caused by rising sea surface temperatures and melting polar ice. The Arabian Sea is already warmer by 1 degree centigrade. As per the National Institute for Oceanography, mean sea level rise on the western coast of India was just over 1 mm/ year for most of the 20th century.

Yet, as per the most recent IPCC report, global sea level rise is accelerating and will likely increase by between 400 and 800 mm by 2100. While this number may seem small, it adds a significant punch to storm surges. With temperatures rising faster than the more conservative estimates of the IPCC reports, the Coastal Road EIA suggests that “the city of Mumbai needs to prepare itself against any natural calamities likely to occur in future”. Less clear in that document, however, is how the road, to be built on landfill, may either assist or impede these preparations.

Landfill has, on one hand, produced significant ground for Mumbai in the last 200 years. Yet, with climate change, the city cannot continue to reclaim land, because, as several government reports have also documented, reclamation also makes the city vulnerable to flooding. For instance, the Coastal Road DPR points out that reclamations of the Mithi River and Mahim exacerbated the Mumbai floods of 2005.

Today, “there are 40 chronic flooding locations… that are spread over the island city, eastern and western suburbs”. Many of these locations are located on reclaimed land. With sea level rise and intensified rainfall, we can expect there to be significantly more locations to develop in the future. Climate change, apart from being an environmental issue, is an urban issue, where it produces increased vulnerability to large scale flooding and disaster, that will affect the lives of many, if not most city residents.

This is why the city needs to carefully evaluate whether new infrastructure projects will make the city even more vulnerable to flooding. Unfortunately, the reports commissioned by the MCGM for the coastal road project have not done this work. Instead of assessing the impacts of the road on the urban environment, MCGM studies are focused on the impact of the urban environment on the road.

For instance, to address rising sea levels and storm surges, the road is proposed to be constructed higher at 6 meters above sea level. This, combined with regular resurfacing, is supposed to ensure that the probability of flooding of the Coastal Road remains low (Risk Assessment and Disaster Management Plan). While many of the measures listed in project documents may reduce the risk of the road flooding, the road may increase the problems of flooding in adjacent low-lying areas.

What does the elevated road do to reclaimed neighbourhoods like Prabhadevi, Tardeo and Warden Road; neighbourhoods that are between 1m and 5m above mean sea level? How will intense rainfalls in the city leave these neighbourhoods through drains that need go through reclaimed land, higher sea walls and higher sea levels?

We don’t know. This is because the BMC has, to date, not conducted a single integrated study exploring how the road will interact with the rough seas and rain every monsoon. The Disaster Management Plan does not investigate the impact of the road on low lying neighbourhoods. To be sure, MCGM has commissioned a hastily conducted drainage study, and also a separate study of storm surges, tides and tsunamis conducted by a different agency.

But flooding events ensue when drainage and wave action interact. Neither study has explored the relationship between road, rain, drainage and sea. Thus, the study on storm surges examines sea level rise, but does not account for the intensification of rainfall in its models. Rain is not even mentioned in its report.

The Drainage Report tacitly acknowledges that storm water drains are not very functional at high tide. Then, it goes on to account for rainfall intensity, but does not account for tides or sea level rise upon which drainage depends. Based on study terms set out by the BMC, both reports produce an incomplete and dangerous understanding of the city’s urban ecology. Both reports ignore the effect of intense rains on a city in a sea. With its partial blindness emerging from its determination to build a road, the BMC is ignoring how it may also be building conditions for a flood.

Experts agree that increased likelihood of extreme weather events associated with climate change today make Mumbai one of the riskiest cities to inhabit in the world. The city needs to urgently rethink and put in place not just disaster management plans, but infrastructures that reduce the city’s exposure to these risks. Today, however, the city is doing less than nothing to address its ecological and social vulnerabilities to climate change, storm surges and flooding.

By radically altering the city’s coastline through reclamation and infrastructure construction without even so much as examining and addressing the impacts of this project on an intensification of urban flooding in the future, it is actively being engaged in the long-term production of a “natural” disaster.

With the government expected to take a decision on the eco-restoration of the Buckingham Canal, the people living along its banks face an uncertain future. Blamed for encroaching on the waterway and releasing sewage into it, they face the threat of being uprooted and resettled in the suburbs.

Given the experience of other oustees, residents hope the government will adopt a more humane approach this time and not resort to ad hoc resettlement The city is set to witness the largest ever resettlement of residents shortly. With the State government expected to make a decision on the eco-restoration of the Buckingham Canal this month, over 2 lakh residents are keeping their fingers crossed, worried about possible relocation from their homes in the city.

According to estimates, more than 29,000 families were identified in 2009 as encroachers on the Buckingham Canal. A new survey this year is estimated to have identified at least 60,000 families. The resettlement of these residents remains a major hurdle to the eco-restoration of the Buckingham Canal.

The State government expects very tough resistance from more than 50% of the residents in the slum neighbourhoods along the canal for the resettlement project

Owing to the resistance to the ecorestoration project, residents along the canal may get attractive packages as compensation, which may even include parcels of land measuring at least 600 sq ft and assistance to build houses. Residents may also opt for an apartment worth Rs.13.5 lakh in the city outskirts. The government is yet to take a final decision

Commercial buildings in the Buckingham Canal right of way will be demolished without any compensation for the owners

The funds required for the project will be more than Rs.1000 crore in the short term

The project affected families will be categorised into two different types: those in objectionable land on the 'right of way' and those on government lands away from the right of way

The detailed project report is set to be finalised shortly, after which the State government will make a decision on evicting those in government lands away from the right of way

Sorry state

Buckingham Canal is 48 km long from Ennore to Muttukadu in the city, and is in desperate need for ecorestoration and rejuvenation. The canal plays a critical role in flood mitigation in city and the State government is planning to restore the canal. But the ecorestoration of the canal has been delayed by four years after the floods in 2015

Even after declaration of the city as open defecation free as part of Swachh Bharat Mission, the canal remains a hub of open defecation

The reduction of the right of way by construction of retaining walls along the canal by the water resources department is a major challenge to flood mitigation. The decision to restore the canal to the original width after demolition of the encroachments remains the most challenging one for the State government.

N. Ravi, a resident of a slum along the canal, said 21 families who were permitted by the District Collector to build houses in a neighbourhood in Triplicane along the Buckingham Canal are also worried about resettlement. The families allotted land in the area belong to a community that carried out solid waste management for city residents.

“All those who were allotted houses belong to the socially weaker sections. Hundreds of other encroachers have also developed houses later, polluting the canal. Now, we are also worried. We are yet to get patta,” said Mr. Ravi, whose family members received the land several decades ago.

Most houses along the canal have been letting sewage into the waterway, affecting public health. Open defecation has been reported along the canal even after declaration of the city as open defecation free under the requirements of the Swachh Bharat Mission.

Some residents who supported the move to demolish encroachments along the canal said the government would get huge parcels of lands in areas such as Ice House to develop a bus terminus. A few residents suggested an alternative road along the Buckingham Canal to decongest Kamarajar Salai and Santhome High Road. However, officials are planning to landscape the area, to improve disaster preparedness for the entire city.

Former Corporation Councillor S. Mangala Raj of Mylapore said the eviction of the residents along the Buckingham Canal is not possible. “Unlike Cooum and Adyar, residents along the Buckingham Canal are those who were allotted land by the government. It is impossible to evict them. Officials are trying to evict them without understanding the social condition of the people along the canal. They will resist any move to evict them,” he said.

“My estimate is that there are 3 lakh voters in the area, covering at least 20% of the Corporation wards in the city. There are more than 80,000 families along the canal, higher than the official estimates. Some people will welcome the move as the value of their property will increase. Even my property value will increase in the event of a major demolition drive. But I do not support the move to evict residents along the Buckingham Canal. They should restore the canal by developing new houses in the same area with additional floor space index. It was the government that allotted land to the people. For example, residents of a particular community were permitted to build houses in areas such as Slaterpuram and Shanmugam Pillai Street near Ambedkar Bridge. All the residents belong to socially weaker sections,” said Mr. Mangala Raj.

50 acres at stake

According to estimates, more than 50 acres of government land may be retrieved from residents along the canal in areas such as Triplicane, Raja Annamalai Puram and Mylapore. The land to be retrieved is likely to be more in areas of South Buckingham Canal and North Buckingham Canal.

Many have started building new huts on land reclaimed from the canal, expecting benefits from the resettlement drive. S. Kanaka, a resident of a colony abutting the Buckingham Canal near Ambedkar Bridge, Mylapore, fears losing her livelihood. Though relocation is yet to begin, she has nightmares of the house she’s living in being torn down.

According to reports, Chennai’s slum population adds up to 3 lakh families. Most of the informal settlements are built along the banks of various waterways passing through the city. The 2015 floods brought to light the vulnerable conditions in which these families live as over four lakh households were inundated. The encroachments on these waterways, blocking the free flow of water, were among the reasons for floodwaters inundating the entire city, leading to loss of lives and property.

Court steps in

Following the catastrophe, the Madras High Court directed the State government to relocate 50,000 families living along the Adyar and Cooum rivers as well as the Buckingham Canal, in addition to waterbodies linked to them.

Under the Integrated Cooum River Eco-Restoration Project, 14,257 Project Affected Families (PAFs) have been identified, and thus far 9,400 PAFs relocated. Under the Adyar River Restoration Project, 9,539 PAFs have been identified, of which 4,400 have been relocated.

Though the work of preparation of a Detailed Project Report (DPR) for eco-restoration of the Buckingham Canal is still under way, it is expected to be completed this month. The State government in 2009 claimed that they had identified close to 28,000 families living on the 48-km stretch of the Buckingham Canal from Ennore to Kovalam.

“There is no transparency about when and why the relocation is happening. I have seen officials coming as early as 6 a.m. with JCBs and police force and residents scampering to collect their belongings before their house is removed,” said Ms. Kanaka.

Though the residents claim that they are not against relocating, they want the government to provide them houses in the city and not in the suburbs. Residents also complained that most of the evictions are carried without prior notice, information about time or date, and with no information about a rehabilitation package.

Livelihood loss

“Our main fear is loss of livelihood. We are seeing people who were relocated to Perumbakkam, Kannagi Nagar, Navalur, Gudapakkam and Athipattu suffer. They are forced to travel close to 40 km every day,” said Hemant Kumar, a resident of Elango Nagar in Raja Annamalai Puram.

Residents also complained about lack of transparency. “The families here actually do not wish to live along the canal, thanks to many discomforts, including suffering from mosquito bites. However, we do not want to be pushed to some suburban areas. Our children will suffer, their access to education will be restricted and eventually they will drop out,” said Prem Kumar, a short film director, who lives in Ambedkar Nagar.

A resident of Neelam Baashah Dargah in Triplicane pointed out that more than the slums, the MRTS and offices are the main encroachers and polluters of the canal. He added that residents do not allow dumping of garbage into the canal as it would adversely affect them. “Until the construction of MRTS began, the water was flowing. But after the pillars were erected, it became stagnant. In Perungudi, one can see waste from industries being dumped into the canal,” said K. Damodaran, a resident.

Options ignored?

Vanessa Peter, a policy researcher with the Information and Resource Centre for Deprived Urban Communities, said that the act of evicting informal settlements and relocating them to sites in the periphery is an act of discrimination as the government is deliberately opting for the relocation option while ignoring possibilities of in situ development and reconstruction.

“The final Report of the Integrated Cooum River Eco-Restoration Plan prepared by CRRT and TNUIFSL had proposed three options for the affected families: the first option is inside development wherever possible; the second is that of in situ reconstruction and only the third option is resettlement,” she said.

Despite the Chief Secretary, in a meeting on March 1, 2010, commissioning a high-level committee to prepare a policy/set of guidelines on rehabilitation and resettlement, no such norms have been formulated.

The State government has acknowledged the need for a policy on housing and habitat and a policy on resettlement when IRCDUC presented the findings of the report, Forced to the Fringes, Disasters of Resettlement in India, to the Secretary of the Department of Municipal Administration and Water Supply.

“Despite the government acknowledging the need for a policy framework for housing and resettlement in the State, several resettlement sites are being constructed and people are being forcefully evicted and relocated, without any initiative to develop a comprehensive housing and resettlement policy,” added Ms. Peter. Activists also stressed the need for a Social Impact Assessment study. “It has been done only for the slums at Pallavaram Salai and Navalar Nedunchezhiyan Nagar,” she added.

Sources in the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board said unlike previous relocations, residents will be provided housing within the city. “We will reconstruct the existing tenements with more floors and houses and they will be accommodated there. This way neither will they lose livelihood nor will their children’s education be affected,” said a TNSCB official.

More importantly, with another monsoon upon the city, there is a genuine fear that if there are good rains, there might be a repeat of the horror of December 2015. While hasty resettlement cannot be advocated, it is imperative that the issue be put on the top of the State’s agenda, activists have stressed.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

While parts of northern and southern India were struggling with drought-like conditions in the summer, the Northeast and western coastal areas have been battered with torrential downpour lately. Successive disasters have compelled us to turn our attention to the million-dollar question: Has climate crisis hit home?

According to weather website El Dorado, out of the 15 places that have received most rainfall across the globe in the last 24 hours, eight are in India. Naliya, a town in Gujarat, received a record 10.3 inch rainfall, followed by Okha (Gujarat, 6.54 inch), Rajkot (Gujarat, 5.83 inch), Mahabaleshwar (Maharashtra, 5.59 inch), Cochin (Kerala, 4.97 inch), Alappuzha (Kerala, 4.45 inch) and Kozhikode (Kerala, 4.57 inch).

Only two months back, the same weather listing source had counted four places in India among the world’s hottest 15 places.

Scientists agree that extreme weather conditions may most likely spike in the coming days. All these events couldn’t be put in a single bracket. However, one has to notice that there were some particularly extreme events that took place in a single day in many parts of the country, says Raj Bhagat Palanichamy, an earth observation expert with World Resources Institute, India.

Unfortunately, it is very difficult to predict such events. But the effects of such events would be higher in future due to loss of natural infrastructure as well as the ever-expanding human settlements. Even if the same number of events takes place in the country next year, the social and financial costs would be higher, Palanichamy added.

Multi-decade rain deficit to rising temperatures have shaken up the usual weather patterns. The ministry of earth sciences, India, has also confirmed that the year 2018 was the sixth warmest year on record since nation-wide records commenced in 1901. However, it was lower than the warmest year of 2016 (+0.720C).

Last year, the mean temperature during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons were also above normal.

Chennai was the test case of drought when north and central India were facing a massive heat wave in June. After the public presser, the government announced a special 50-wagon train to import water from outlying districts. Chennai would get water from such arrangement till October.

But while Chennai in India’s eastern coast is waiting for proper monsoon, large swathes of land along the western coast have been hit by floods due to heavy rain. More than 64,000 people have been evacuated to 738 relief camps in Kerala, and property worth over Rs 1,000 crore damaged. This is the story of two neighbouring states.

The river Periyar in Kerala, one of the longest in India with immense discharge potential, is in a spate, along with other major rivers such as Bharathapuzha, Pamba and Wayanad. In Karnataka, the flood situation downstream to Kabini river, a tributary of Cauvery, and other rivers remain grim.

Palanichamy and other experts said that floods in northern and southern Karnataka and the Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu have been caused by extreme rainfall which these places haven’t witnessed in quite some time. Before the commencement of rainfall in this region, it was a potential drought-affected area. Over a single week, the dams are now full in Cauvery basin.

The timeline of extreme natural calamities started from May when a powerful cyclone roared through Odisha with wind speeds of up to 130 mph. It was the most dangerous storm in recent years.

India has about 4 per cent of the world’s freshwater resources and is counted among the top 10 water-rich countries. But it also scored as a water-stressed region.

According to the Working Group II report of the Fourth Assessment of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, India has been designated as a water-stressed region’ with utilisable freshwater standing at 1,122 cubic metres (cu m) per year and per capita compared to international standards of 1,700 cu m.

A recent study shows that Himalayan glaciers, the main water source in India, are melting rapidly and likely to lead to severe droughts conditions in the northern states.

Scientists are divided on whether global warming is responsible for the change in Indian monsoon patterns. But climate crisis is a reality and being faced in the form of multi-decade rain deficit and flash floods.

In 2015, unprecedented and sudden floods paralysed Chennai with over 18 lakh people being displaced. Following this, at the behest of the office of the Principal Scientific Advisor to government of India, research institutions, chief among them the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), Chennai, and IITs, got together to build a flood warning system customised for use in Chennai. Carrying the acronym C-FLOWS, which stands for Chennai FLOod Warning System, the six-module ensemble can predict flooding due to heavy rainfall, sea-level rise and increase in water levels of the three rivers — Cooum, Adyar and Kosasthalaiyar — that traverse the city.

Ward-level data

“The State government shared data such as ward boundaries, population details, infrastructure available across Tamil Nadu, which have been used in the warning system,” says M. V. Ramana Murthy, Director, NCCR. The topography data was obtained from the Indian Remote Sensing programme. “Next we plan to develop such a system for Mumbai city and Cochin area,” he adds.

Knowing the elevation at different spots, the system can predict the way the area would flood based on different scenarios that have been simulated. Inputs were taken from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on forecast and National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), which gives the prediction for rain 10 days in advance. Similarly, INCOIS gives the hydrodynamic congestion such as storm surge and tide etc. Using this, the system can, two weeks ahead of the event, simulate the scenario. “The system can predict what would happen at the level of individual wards,” says Tune Usha, scientist with the NCCR and one of the key persons behind the development of C-FLOWS. “We can now apply it to the Greater Chennai Corporation area of 462 sq. km,” she adds.

Thus, early warnings could be issued. “The flood itself cannot be avoided, but it can be managed and the disaster mitigated,” says Dr Usha.

The spatial database of the city which contains all administrative layers, details of ward boundaries, infrastructure, details of elevations and surfaces, soil, land use, geomorphology and census datasets are contained in the first module. There are many precomputed scenarios of flooding based on the forecast rainfall and tidal conditions, in a library. From this the most appropriate one may be selected for superimposing on the geomorphology. The second module has to do with this precisely. Simultaneously, models can also be run in real time based on actual datasets. Over this can be overlaid details of storm water drains and drainage fractions to enable pre-flood planning operations.

The 3D visualisation module makes possible a realistic visualisation of the flooding in various places such as infrastructure, buildings, roads, ward boundaries etc, by superimposing the model outputs on the layers of data.

Convergence

Data from IMD, NCMRWF, INCOIS and Tamil Nadu State government are brought together in an online hub along with the field data and the remote sensing data to observe the situation in real time. This is the fourth module.

Authorised personnel can use a mobile app, which has been developed alongside, to collect data from flooded areas such as geotagged photographs and add to the database. This fifth module helps capture the ground reality and provide primary information for decision makers to plan relief and mitigation operations.

The last aspect is a decision support system: this is an online GIS query portal which can answer questions on quantum of flooding in specific localities, flood proximity, for example, it can say which roads are inundated and suggest routes for planning relief operations and so on.

A CAG report tabled in the Tamil Nadu assembly on July 9, states that the disaster which many have been made to believe as a natural calamity was a man-made one

According to the Tamil Nadu government 470 people had died between October and December due to floods. J Jayalalithaa, who was the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu, in a detailed statement had said that the unprecedented rains was the cause for the deluge and also the huge damage in Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Cuddalore, Tuticorin and Tirunelveli districts.

advertisement

However, the CAG report that was released in 2016, has another narrative. The audit body has rebuked the state government in the way the Chennai floods in 2015 was handled and goes to call it a ""man-made"" disaster.

After continuous pressure put by the Opposition parties in the state, the TN government tabled the CAG report on July 9, the last day of the assembly session.

""This is a 2015 report based on the experience we had in 2015, when there was heavy rain; in 2016 and 2017 the occurrence was controlled,"" fisheries minister D Jayakumar said.

In 2016 and 2017 too many regions in Chennai and neighbouring districts faced heavy flooding.

In November 2017, Narayanapuram and Tambaram areas in Chennai, and Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts too had faced heavy flooding. ""Those were only minor floodings,"" said Jayakumar who also added that the concerned departments will reply to the CAG report.

The report points at faults with the government especially with the water resources department being blamed the most.

The CAG report states that water from Chembarambakkam reservoir was released in excess and caused the over flowing of the Adayar river, which flows through Chennai.

The audit body has charged the water resource department with not following the Central Water Commission (CWC) norms to release the water from Chembarambakkam.

According to CAG, discharge of water could have been maintained at 12,000 cusecs for another six hours but the water was released in an indiscriminate manner.

The continuous release of 29,000 cusecs water over 21 hours into the Adyar river was seen as the main reason for the flooding.

""Government of Tamil Nadu failed not only to create new reservoirs and check dams to mitigate the flood hazards due to monsoon rains but also did not take any action to divert flood water from Adyar river,"" read the report.

Shockingly, the water resource department did not even have a compendium of rules or regulations for Chembarambakkam. In 2005 too a major flood had hit Chennai and its neighbouring districts and even after that an emergency action plan was not set up by the government.

advertisement

The lack of government initiative to keep systems in check and rules and regulations in place too has been blamed by the CAG.

""We are not surprised with CAG report. We have long said government environmental policy is detrimental to the interests of state,"" said DMK spokesperson R Kannan.

Fast forward to 2016 and 2017; things have not changed much for Chennai and its neighbouring districts. During 2017 floods it was seen that the state government was working on an emergency basis to remove encroachments after the area was flooded.

In its report on Schemes for Flood Control and Flood Forecasting in the country, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) has faulted the State government on at least three counts for the Chennai floods in 2015.

In the 2017 report, the CAG has, based on the response received in December 2016 from the Water Resources Department (WRD), said there was no Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for the reservoirs in Chennai and its suburbs in case of overflow or breach. The EAP could have helped in better management of flood discharge from all reservoirs, including the Chembarambakkam tank, during the 2015 floods.

It was observed that the master plan for Chennai and its suburbs, for three rivers – Kosasthalaiyar, Cooum and Adyar – was not prepared to manage floods and for the augmentation of the water resources, based on the response received in August 2016.

The Engineer-in-Chief, WRD, stated [in August 2016] that a comprehensive master plan for Chennai and its suburbs could be evolved only in coordination with the district administration and local bodies.

The absence of coordination between the WRD, the Revenue department and the local bodies contributed to the non-preparation of a basin-wise Comprehensive Master Plan, ruling out the planned execution of macro and micro drainage networks, the CAG pointed out.

Nandambakkam flooding

The creation of a flood protection wall/embankment in the Adyar river near Nandambakkam bridge proposed [in July 2008] to the Union government under the Centrally sponsored Flood Management Programme (FMP) was withdrawn by the Chief Engineer, WRD, in March 2012.

The reason: inability of the WRD to acquire 0.69 hectares of land for the project which resulted in non-initiation of flood protection works and non-availing of Central grant of ₹7.60 crore. This could have been one of the contributing factors for heavy inundation in the Nandambakkam area during the 2015 floods, the report said.

No real-time data

No flood forecasting scheme was sanctioned for Tamil Nadu during the XI Plan under the Central Sector scheme. In the XII Plan, an action plan for the installation of 41 telemetry stations in Tamil Nadu was prepared (July 2016) but tenders remained to be finalised [July 2016].

Modernised flood forecasting infrastructure using real-time data acquisition system and forecasting models for all river basins were not developed in the State. Floods forecasting was based on the meteorological forecast and the special warning issued by the IMD, it pointed out further.

Moreover, the proposal [June 2014] to form a committee to make recommendations for enacting the Flood Plain Zoning Bill was under the consideration of the State government [August 2016].

Lack of legislation for the Flood Plain Zoning resulted in developments abutting waterways, leading to the inundation in Chennai and its suburbs during the 2015 floods, the CAG reported. However, the fact remained that the Bill on Flood Plain Zoning could not be enacted in most States even after more than 40 years since it was first envisaged, it added.",issue,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu","December 1, 2015","December 5, 2015",Chennai and its suburbs,"1,044 mm","₹10,000 crore",500,10 lakh people were displaced,"The floods were caused by heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of the Adyar, Cooum and Kosasthalaiyar rivers.

The 2015 floods is seared in our collective memory; and we call it Chennai Floods and December Deluge. If you are a stickler for accuracy, it should be 2015 Coromandel Coast Floods or 2015 November-December Floods. For, it swept through Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry. And, before December, there were at least two episodes of heavy rains in November, contributing to the overall devastation along the Coast. But, everyone of us is naturally inclined to define even collective suffering in highly personalised terms, validating the exercise with our unique experiences. Each of these experiences is as essential to understanding the larger picture as is a jigsaw piece to solving a puzzle.

There are unique flood stories from Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), because the region is dotted with lakes and many of these burst their embankments in November-December 2015.

There were stories of how HR managers of rival IT companies put their heads together to understand the situation and shape their response to it. There were also stories of servers being carried to safety; and of operations being shifted to other cities that were on dry ground.

For some of the IT professionals who were also residents of OMR, it was a double whammy. On the morning of December 1 this year, which marked the third anniversary of the floods, I met Thiyagarajan Sivakumar who personalises the 2015 Chennai Floods by calling it the Perumbakkam Floods.

Thiyagarajan is part of the mammoth IT workforce on OMR and a resident of Perumbakkam. He and his family had to abandon their apartment in Indira Priyadarshini Nagar three different times during the 2015 Chennai Floods. “On all the three occasions, the problem started on a Tuesday — November 17 and 24, and December 1. On November 17, the Perumbakam lake had broken its bunds and the water was chest-high. There was some flooding on November 24, not as serious as the previous one, but we did not want to take a chance. And the December rains were catastrophic. In our locality, there was enough water to submerge a six-footer and we had to be rescued in boats. A metal cot had to be placed on the first-floor sunshade for us to board the boats. We are in a low-lying area and surrounded by lakes and a wetland and therefore a sitting duck for lake bund-breaking rains,” recalls Thiyagarajan.

These stories have to be told and retold because they help residents to look for ways to protect themselves. Following the 2015 cataclysm, Indira Gurudev Colony Residents Welfare Association (which Indira Priyadarshini Nagar is a part of) has been keenly focussed on issues relating to rainwater drainage.

Thiyagarajan explains: “The natural course for rainwater in Perumbakkam is to flow from South to North. There was a unique system of floodwater drainage predating urbanisation of the area. Excess rainwater from Perumbakkam was designed to flow into Okkiyam Maduvu. From Okkiyam Maduvu, it would flow into the Buckingham Canal and then into the sea. So, when the culverts on the Medavakkam-Sholinganallur Road were done away with for the creation of stormwater drains, we sought alternative culverts to drain floodwater in a similar manner. Two months ago, three culverts were created on the Global Hospital Road. This system may not be bulwark against flooding of the kind that we experienced in December 2015. But it would certainly spare you the inconveniences we faced in November that year.”",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

The entry/exit structure of underground metro stations were built to protect the station from flooding.A senior metro rail official said the entry structure was designed based on the high flood level , the level at which water rises to cause inundation, to prevent water from entering the underground facilities.They have been built at about 0.6m above the high flood level, which is 1.5m in the city.“We have followed the high flood level calculated based on the 2015 floods to prevent water from entering the concourse level,” a metro rail official said. “Water will not enter the stations even if there is unprecedented rain. But if it enters the stations, we have adequate facilities like drains and pumping systems to draw the water out.” The 45km Phase-1 has 19 underground stations out of which 13 stations are operational.All entry points have four sets of stairs — built above the pavements in some stations — which lead to another flight of stairs and an escalator connecting the non-paid area in the concourse or ticketing level. The concourse level of the underground stations were designed for the use of both commuters and pedestrians. From the entrance to the ticketing area, both commuters and pedestrians can take shelter during rains, as they are non-paid area.At Saidapet, metro rail has built flood walls on either side of the ramp linking the underground station with the elevated Little Mount station as it has been constructed across the Adyar river which was in spate during the 2015 flood. In December 2015, Chennai was flooded after water released from Chembarambakkam Lake caused the Adyar to overflow submerging the Maraimalai Adigal bridge at Saidapet.

Jolted out of complacency after the devastating 2015 floods in Chennai, city authorities have begun to restore water bodies in the coastal metropolis. But experts and activists say that there’s a long way to go

Whenever P. Hemamalini goes to her house in West Mambalam in the southern metropolis of Chennai, she goes past Lake View Road. Unfortunately there is neither a view nor a lake along the road. “It is just a congested road packed with buildings,” she said.

It was during the 2015 floods in the city that she realised the meaning of the road’s name she was living on. “The entire neighbourhood was flooded, with the water coming to at least 5-6 ft on the road. It was then I realised that I was living in a low-lying area and it was once a lake,” she told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “For two weeks in December 2015, my family and I had to live elsewhere.”

The low-lying area gets inundated easily and is known for its mosquito menace. “Mosquitoes were such a big problem that we had a local cricket team called Mambalam Mosquitos that was established in the 1940s,” said M.V. Sridhar, an old-time resident of Chennai.

While across the city, Lake View roads and Eri Karai roads (roads along the shore of a water body) are common in areas like Nungambakkam, Velachery and other low-lying areas, the actual water bodies are missing. As Chennai loses its water bodies to encroachment as well pollution from sewage and garbage, its residents are paying a price for it.

It took rainfall of epic proportions in 2015 for Chennai’s city planners to move out of their inertia and come up with a comprehensive plan to mitigate flooding caused by excessive rains, one of which is to save existing lakes. In December 2015, several rain gauges in and around Chennai recorded close to 500 mm of rain in a 24-hour period — more than the annual average of at least 31 countries.

With clogged drains and encroached water bodies, the water had nowhere to go but into people’s homes. Some 400 persons died, and 1.8 million people were displaced. The metropolis faced an economic loss of USD 7 billion. See: Did Chennai learn anything from the 2015 floods?

Smart city initiative

“The 2015 floods was certainly a reminder for the civic body on the importance of lakes and its role in mitigating floods. Every time there is heavy rain, there is palpable fear,” said Raj Cherubal, chief executive officer for the Chennai Smart City Ltd (CSCL), a special purpose vehicle formed to implement several new-age initiatives in different spheres of urban planning. The INR 10 billion (USD 146 million) initiative gets half its funding from the central government, and the rest from the state government. It is to be implemented over five years.

With the formation of CSCL, some 210 lakes in the cities have been identified, and are in the process of being eco-restored by the Chennai Corporation, several corporations through their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds and non-governmental organisations.

With so many entities in the fray, there is no standard protocol on restoring these water bodies. “Each entity, depending on their budget, takes up restoration work. It seems as though the restorations plans for individual lakes are quite ad hoc without a larger plan,” Pradeep Kumar, a Chennai-based reporter who covers the Greater Chennai Corporation on a daily basis, told indiaclimatedialogue.net.

Restoration of several wetlands, mangroves, enforcement of coastal regulation zone rules and even water bodies in Chennai has fallen between the cracks of bureaucracy. The Chennai metropolitan area is a mega watershed area, with more than 4,000 water bodies in it. “Right now, we are looking only at lakes owned by the Chennai Corporation. Several more are owned by the different departments like fisheries, forest, PWD (public works department) and HR&CE (Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments),” Cherubal told indiaclimatedialogue.net. See: Mismanaged urbanisation and the destruction of Indian wetlands

Importance of local hydrology

To make meaningful changes, the hydrology of the region must be considered as a whole, experts say. “All the water flows from west to east through a system of intricate canals and storm water drains. Any restoration should be done holistically, keeping in mind the larger hydrology and topography of the region,” said S Janakarajan, Professor at Madras Institute of Development Studies.

Janakarajan has studied the hydrology of Chennai and it’s water bodies over the past 15 years and has been a member of several committees set up by various government agencies. He estimates that at least 15% of the Chennai’s water bodies have been lost due to encroachment. “There is not a single study to show the extent of the loss,” he told indiaclimatedialogue.net.

Janakarajan remains critical about lake and water restoration projects in the city. “The restorations in the past have usually been ad hoc. To restore a water body, a silt survey needs to be done, the supply channels to the water body and storm water drains need to be restored, and encroachments be cleared. There has to be a systematic approach while restoring the lake,” he pointed out.

The CEO of CSCL is candid about these shortfalls and says there have been challenges that they have been working for the past year. He says that apart from the detailed project reports that the corporations have done for 32 lakes, the entity that is restoring the lake takes up the responsibility of identifying the problem and take appropriate measures.

“Based on the budget of the corporates, we suggest which lake they can take up. There are a couple of technical NGOs that help in studying the requirements of each lake and what needs to be done for restoration. These are put in a report and is submitted to the corporation for approval,” said Cherubal.

Minimum standards

He agreed that different NGOs have different methods and protocols to survey lakes. Some of the parameters to look for are identifying the perimeter of the lake, the amount of silt that gets deposited, the original depth and capacity and the quality of the water. “However, we ensure that minimum standards are maintained, such as de-silting, strengthening bunds (embankments), and taking help from the (municipal) corporation to remove encroachment,” he said.

When it comes to identifying and restoring storm water drains and supply channels to the water bodies, different government agencies have different responsibilities. “The next step of evolution is to integrate all these responsibilities,” said Cherubal.

There have been several lakes that have been discovered in Chennai. “In some places, it would just like look vegetation, till we find that there was once a lake [there, in the] revenue records,” Cherubal said. “There are at least 50 more lakes within the corporation limits that have completely disappeared due to encroachment,” Balamurugan N., a senior associate from Chennai City Connect, one of the several NGOs working closely with CSCL in restoring lakes in the city, told indiaclimatedialogue.net.

While a few lakes have been encroached upon, others have been polluted with garbage and sewage. A few others need dredging and de-silting. “In 97 lakes, some sort of work has started. We expect to restore all lakes before the commencement of this year’s north-east monsoon,” said Cherubal.

Lakes and climate resilience

Restoring lakes is seen as a way of making the city resilient to climate change, recharge groundwater resources and ensure the flora and fauna of the city are given space to flourish. “Some 16 lakes are already in good condition,” said an engineer from the Greater Chennai Corporation, who did not want to be named.

The 2015 flood is not the only reason why Chennai needs to restore its lakes. The coastal city has become wetter over the years and needs a proper drainage system for the water to run off. “The annual average rainfall has increased, and droughts now remain in distant memory,” Y.E.A. Raj, a former deputy director general of India Meteorological Department, told indiaclimatedialogue.net.

Data from IMD show that the city has received excessive rainfall between 2004 and 2011, for eight years consecutively. “This is the longest streak ever since weather recording began in Chennai in 1870,” Raj said.

Activists in the city say that they do not see any sincerity in the way the Greater Chennai Corporation or the Government of Tamil Nadu goes about protected water bodies or wetlands to make the city safe from flooding and other vagaries of climate change. They point out that the biggest encroachers have gone untouched.

“In general, what we have seen of the Chennai Corporation or the government of Tamil Nadu is that they are simply targeting low-income encroachers. It does not have the capacity or the political will to take on the really big industrial and commercial encroachers,” said Nityananad Jayaraman, an activist based in Chennai. “In Ennore, close to 2,000 acres of wetlands have already been encroached upon by various industries like the Kamarajar Port and the North Chennai Thermal Power Station. Another equal amount or more is expected of wetlands is expected to be encroached with the help of the state government and various other authorities who are responsible for protecting Chennai for Adani port. I don’t see any sincerity in any of this (initiative to restore water bodies).”",solution,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, India",12/12/2015,12/14/2015,Chennai,500 mm,USD 7 billion,400,1.8 million people were displaced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Images of 2015 floods are seared into the minds of Chennai’s residents and almost every locality now has a lore of flood stories. Using the powerful imagery of this cataclysm, P. Viswanathan has started a Facebook group that seeks to promote civic consciousness among residents of Chitlapakkam. Viswanathan is convenor of Chitlapakkam Residents’ Associations Coordination Committee.

How Flood Water Entered Chitlapakkam (HFWEC), as the FB group is called, displays an image of a street under sheets of floodwater. The initiative was born out of the ordeal faced by residents of Chitlapakkam in the aftermath of the floods. Residents were encouraged to share photos of their submerged streets and houses, says Viswanathan.

Every year, when it rains heavily, residents of Chitlapakkam would be home-bound for at least 10 days due to heavy flooding, he says, adding that poor management of waterbodies, which includes lack of action against encroachments, is the reason for the flooding.

It may be noted that Sembakkam lake, Chitlapakkam lake and Selaiyur lake are found in close proximity to each other. Viswanathan says poor maintenance of water channels linking these lakes by the Water Resources Department is the major cause of flooding.

Though factors that led to the flooding of Chitlapakkam and surrounding localities, which include Selaiyur and Sembakkam, as well as the state of lakes in the region are discussed, the group also focusses on everyday peeves such as long queues at railway counters.

For example, a recent post shared an image of a railway counter with a queue of waiting commuters, during the morning rush hour at the Tambaram Sanatorium railway station.

In ward 191, officials have identified 21 areas that are prone to inundation, the largest number identified in any ward.

Sukumar Babu said stormwater drains have been developed in some of the 205 flood-prone areas such as Razak Garden in ward 105 after the floods in 2015. “But there are challenges in desilting such drains and a delay in connecting them to disposal points,” Mr. Babu added.

‘Down since 2015’

During December 2015, inundation to the extent of five feet was reported in 37 localities such as MRC Nagar, Srinagar Colony and CIT Nagar. The civic body initiated measures to reduce severe flooding in such areas by developing drains and canals. “The number of locations with severe flooding has decreased since 2015,” an official said.

Major roads like the Nungambakkam High Road, Dr. Besant Road, Anna Salai, Avvai Shanmugham Salai and Dr. R.K. Salai feature in the civic body’s list of roads likely to get flooded this year.

“Work on the stormwater drains has started in these areas. We will complete it by next month,” an official said.",flood,Chennai Floods 2018,"Chennai, India",December 2015,January 2016,"['Perungudi', 'MRC Nagar', 'Srinagar Colony', 'CIT Nagar', 'Nungambakkam High Road', 'Dr. Besant Road', 'Anna Salai', 'Avvai Shanmugham Salai', 'Dr. R.K.

It was December 2015 in Chennai. Within a matter of days, 420 people were dead, several homes and vehicles completely destroyed.

Just three years later, Kerala throws a similar picture. About 370 lives have been lost in Kerala. On one hand, insurance claims are piling up and on the other, it is a struggle to reach the insured.

Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad

State-owned insurers, including Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and several other PSU insurers, have been asked to settle claims instantly by the government. However, industry sources told Moneycontrol that the insurance claims received are still very few and far in between.

Initial estimates

According to sources, the insurance industry's initial estimates for claims are around Rs 450 crore. A majority of it will be motor insurance, home insurance and life insurance.

The chief of a mid-size private life insurer said they would simplify all the processes, but the biggest issues is to gauge whether an individual has a policy.

""We have received a few hundred death claims but not all the data has been digitised. So we need to first ascertain whether the person had a policy and if it was in force,"" said the head of claims at a private life insurer.

For home insurance, the struggles will be much higher. Home insurance will cover structure of the house and its contents. Due to all documents being lost, insurance companies are trying to ascertain how to verify the claims filed.

Health insurance claims

For health insurance claims, most diseases will be water-borne. Insurers said the biggest hurdle is to offer hospitalisation facilities. There have been pregnant women who are entitled to cashless claims, but have not been able to reach hospitals due to connectivity being cut off.

""We are also in a fix because only a handful of hospitals are operational and not all of them are in the network. Policy wordings mandate that certain covers will be triggered only if hospitalisation occurs,"" said the head of underwriting at a state-owned general insurer.

Extent of damage

During the Chennai floods, the most common claims in motor insurance were related to the engine getting submerged in water. This will be the case with Kerala as well.

""There are specific motor covers related to engine protection. Since all data is available digitally, the insurance details can be easily retrieved. However, for large-scale claims, there will be immediate surveys done,"" said the claims head of a large general insurer.

Some insurers like ICICI Lombard General Insurance are making outbound calls to their customers, to check on their safety and also provide them with support on claims that they wish to intimate.

Furthermore, for motor customers, the company is also directly coordinating with motor vehicle manufacturers to reach out to the customers, to ensure quick and smooth claims processing.",issue,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","August 8, 2018","August 20, 2018",['Kerala'],"['104 cm in 24 hours at Aluva', '26 cm in 12 hours at Idukki', '23 cm in 12 hours at Peermade', '22 cm in 12 hours at Kottayam', '21 cm in 12 hours at Thiruvananthapuram']","['Rs 20,000 crore', '10,000 houses damaged', '100,000 people evacuated', '370 people dead']",,"['Disruption of transportation', 'Power outages', 'Water contamination', 'Food shortages']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

For the next one week, thousands of employees worked day and night to restore services, send food and water to stranded passengers as well as relief to marooned citizens. The nerve centre of this operation was Chennai, from where officers brain-stormed and co-ordinated with officers in Trivandrum and Palaghat divisions as well as with the Railway Board in Delhi.""More than 10,000 passengers were stranded in trains and at stations. We got our local contractors on line, worked with NGOs and ensured that food supplies were sent to them,"" a senior commercial department official said.Staff of pantry cars in trains were asked to cook and come up with easily-prepared items like upma for passengers. Train side vending was activated at stations, while those stranded on platforms were taken to community centres, the official said.About 775 meals for just Rs 30 each were arranged at Ernakulam station, while 1,000 meals were supplied by a local NGO. All platforms were packed with people; railway stations are built at an elevation and have sufficient cover from rain and floods.The breakthrough came on the night of August 17, when trains from Kerala began moving along the Trichy-Madurai-Nagercoil route. Slowly, this section was used to evacuate passengers, especially migrants from states like Jharkhand, West Bengal and Assam, desperate to get back home.While the number of unreserved coaches was increased on special trains, unreserved specials were operated at discounted rates, said officials. Sixteen specials carrying at least 25,000 additional passengers were run till Tuesday night, as per official figures.Sothern Railway also moved 23 lakh litres of water from Chengalpet and Erode via sintex tank wagons to Kerala through Madurai , and IRCTC was roped in to supply 2.2 lakh bottles of Rail Neer from its Palur and Parasala plants.

Around this time three years ago, many residents of Chennai were at their wit’s end, figuring out what to do with their cars standing helplessly in dashboard-high floodwaters. In a knee-jerk reaction, a good number of them started the engines, which is like signing a car’s death warrant. Every car insurance policy document sounds a warning against this panic reaction.

“Honestly, back then, I was not aware of this . Fortunately, I did the right things more by instinct than knowledge. I left my two flood-hit cars alone and called the insurance company immediately and chose to be patient. The cars were declared ‘total loss’. By the end of December, I got my insurance settlement. Both my cars had bumper-to-bumper insurance and I got their market value,” recalls Rammohan Thyagarajan, on the third anniversary of the 2015 Chennai floods. For many vehicle owners in Chennai, that was an eye-opener, as I am sure this year’s Kerala floods has been for those there. I asked Vignesh V Ramakrishnan, founder of CarPal, an online car-buying platform, to respond to three questions about flood-affected cars.

Do pre-owned cars from flood-affected areas come with a stigma affecting their value?

From a general perspective, a pre-owned car from a recently flood-affected city does raise some flags to buyers initially. Dealers too are alert not to get misled by cars that come their way. Most local savvy buyers cross-reference the RTO zone in the registration number. There are always some tell-tale signs that indicate whether the car had been flooded — be it the exteriors, how the steering feels when you drive, or even the abnormal friction/sound from the engine and bearings.

Used-car dealers generally run a service-history check based on the registration number as well, which would help verify if there were any insurance claims made. But once the car is proven to be a clean one, the price is fair.

You may also have to take into account the overall sentiment of the market immediately after a flood.

When should you push for a ‘total loss’?

Pushing for a total loss is an ideal step in case of extensive structural damage, where the build integrity of the car has been compromised, or even flooding after which the car just can’t be brought back to normal. But before pushing for it, it is important to have an understanding of your car’s Insured Declared Value (IDV). The IDV is the pivot.

Typically, most insurers declare a total loss if their liability (after taking depreciation of replaceable parts into account) goes beyond a tipping point of 75% of the IDV. The covers you have would matter in this case too. If you own a car that is fairly old, pushing for total loss would be beneficial, as the IDV would have depreciated to smaller value over all those years of ownership, while the service and spare part costs would have risen in value.

What are the must-have covers in a car insurance policy?

December 2015 clearly taught us how not to be ignorant when it comes to insurance covers. While the negotiation for the premium is always persistent, one shouldn’t compromise on the covers but simply ask for a higher ‘Own Damage’ discount that insurers can modify based on their past claim experiences.

There are some covers that have proved their mettle post the 2015 experience and have now made it to most buyers’ preferences. Zero Depreciation Cover (street name — bumper-to-bumper insurance) ensures that the parts’ depreciation is waived off. This way, you don’t pay out of your pocket apart from the minimum deductible. There’s also Engine Safe Cover that supports in a situation where you start an engine which had water ingression. Return To Invoice (RTI) is a cover that is gaining popularity too. RTI helps you in covering the gap in value between the IDV and the invoice cost of the vehicle. While the covers are great to have, they come at a small premium and have their own limits of relevancy based on your car’s age.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Officials said data is processed at the Decision Support Centre (DSC) at the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) in Hyderabad and disseminated periodically to the Centre and the state under the disaster management support programme of Isro. INSAT-3DR, an advanced meterological satellite configured with an imaging system and an atmospheric sounder, provides data on various parameters like temperature and humidity for weather forecasts.Other remote sensing satellites like Cartosat and Resourcesat send high resolution images captured by onboard cameras that help send out early flood warnings and map the affected areas. Cartosat 2 and 2A can be steered along and across the track to 45 degrees for frequent imaging of a specific area.As soon as information on a flood event is received, Isro officials said the earliest available satellite is programmed to collect the required data for demarcating inundated areas. At the DSC, the data is processed and inundation maps are prepared with flooded and non-flooded areas marked in different colours. The maps are disseminated to the state and central agencies concerned, along with providing information on affected villages and transport network, for planning relief operations.As the satellites help in relief operations instruments deployed in the sea are simultaneously tracking changes in the weather along the west coast. Data from 13 buoys deployed in the Arabian Sea is helping scientists at the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) in Hyderabad forecast high waves and provide wind warnings for up to three days. Six of the buoys have been sending data from locations close to the coast at a depth of 25m-35m including two buoys off the coast of Kozhikode and Kollam. The rest are deployed in the deep sea up to a maximum depth of 3,500m.Various parameters like wave direction, wave period and wave height measured through the sensors in the buoys along with data collected from satellites are used to run a forecast model.“After running the wave forecast model, we send out location-wise forecasts on wave height for the next three days,” said INCOIS director Satheesh C Shenoi.",solution,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","August 8, 2018","August 25, 2018","['Alappuzha', 'Ernakulam', 'Idukki', 'Kottayam', 'Kozhikode', 'Malappuram', 'Palakkad', 'Thrissur', 'Wayanad']","['100-200 mm', '200-300 mm', '300-400 mm', '400-500 mm', '500-600 mm']","['Rs. 20,000 crore', '10,000 houses damaged', '100,000 people displaced']",['374'],"['Disruption of transportation', 'Loss of crops', 'Water contamination', 'Spread of diseases']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Three years later, the state of affairs remains pretty much the same. The 44 micro canals that are supposed to drain surplus rainwater into the Adyar and Cooum rivers , and keep the city flood-free during monsoon , have been reduced to sewage channels. Negligence has altered the character of the canals which are now filled with solid and liquid waste.While the blocked canals would hamper flow of floodwater and inundate the city’s roads and nearby areas in the event heavy rain, at present, the waterways have become permanent breeding grounds for mosquitoes.When TOI visited canals in different parts of Chennai, it found sewage meandering past thick vegetation that mushroomed on the sludge. The micro canal on GNT Road at Erukkancheri in north Chennai that drains into Captain Cotton Canal is clogged with sludge.Ulaganathan, who works at a welding unit near the canal, said the waterbody was not desilted for two years. “The 2015 floods washed away the slush and cleaned the canal to an extent,” he said, “but the government did not dredge it properly after that.”Of the 44 micro canals within the limits of Greater Chennai Corporation , 30 are maintained by the civic body and 14 come under the administrative control of the public works department (PWD). These micro canals with a length ranging from 0.25km to 7.5km are either linked to the Buckingham Canal or drain into the Adyar and Cooum rivers.M Nagammal of Annammal Nagar, a locality situated near the Virugambakkam Canal at Nerkundram, said there was disparity in clearing sewage from the canal. Stretch of the canal near the residential quarters of government officials is cleaned once every month, she said. “But authorities have not carried out any (dredging) work on our side for nearly a year. This canal is a breeding ground for mosquitoes. It swelled during the recent spells of rain,” she said.The canal is maintained by the PWD. Similar is the status of Arumbakkam and Mambalam canals.S Suresh, a slum dweller at Annai Indira Nagar near Vysarpadi, said he spends ?1,350 every month on repellents to keep mosquitoes at bay. “The authorities did not remove the vegetation on a regular basis,” he said.When contacted, a senior corporation official said steps were being taken to make micro canals “sewage free”. “We have deployed amphibian equipment and three robotic multipurpose excavators to clean the open canals. Interceptors are used in canals linked to Cooum and would be extended to Adyar as well,” the official said.The official said action was initiated against 400 violators who let sewage into the canals. “Our aim is to keep the canals dry during summer such that they can carry floodwater during monsoon,” he said.PWD sources said the government had sanctioned ?5.75 crore to clean canals in and around Chennai as part of pre-monsoon preparedness. “Work would start soon,” an official said.",issue,Chennai Floods 2015,"Chennai, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015","['Chennai', 'Tamil Nadu']","['200 mm, 300 mm']",['10 billion USD'],['500'],"['100,000 people displaced', '10,000 homes destroyed', 'Infrastructure damage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

As soon as news of the floods broke, a trained team of animal rescuers from Chennai headed to Kerala, organised by animal activist Shravan Krishnan . Idukki was the only area open to them from Tamil Nadu and the four – Nishant Ravi, Dinesh Baba, Arjun and Peter - entered the district in their own vehicle. “The area was cordoned by army owing to landslides and heavy flooding, so we moved to Kottayam.Our team was coordinating with people in Kerala and we got to know that a lady and 18 of her dogs were trapped in her house near a river bank, at Arpukara, Kottayam,” says Nishanth.Getting a boat toanimals was a problem so they walked through the waters as much as they could and reached the spot, wading through a fast flooding area. “When we reached the house, which was on a river bank, we found that the lady wasbut the dogs were in cages, which were filling with water. Luckily, a local man let us use his boat, and we transferred all of them into the boat and left the area as fast as we could,” says Nishanth. Later they found that the lady was a hoarder and that the dogs were in bad condition. “We plan to file a case on this later.”The team later followed up on othercalls they got and say their experience working in floods in Uttarakhand and Chennai helped them. “At Chengannoor, we got a call about a Labrador trapped in a house and on reaching, found that the family had escaped, leaving it alone without food for five days. We somehow got on to the first floor andit. The army and the fishermen would have prioritised human life, but many locals helped us navigate the unfamiliar terrain and reach the trapped animals,” says Nishant and team.",rescue,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","August 8, 2018","August 20, 2018",Kerala,36 inches,$33 billion,483,10 million people affected,,,,18 dogs,by a team from Chennai,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

In August, most of its solar panels were reportedly damag ed in floods that shut the airport for two weeks.

The flooding was not surprising since the airport, opened in 1999, was built after diverting a tributary of the Periyar river as shown in the map below.

In the past, bad planning and design have led to the shut down of major airports, including Mumbai , Chennai and Delhi . Yet, not much has been learned from such disasters: a new airport is being built by diverting the Ulwe river near Panvel Creek in Navi Mumbai.

Here are some of India’s other airports that are vulnerable to disaster because they have been planned and designed in flagrant disregard of environmental common sense.

Mumbai

Both the Mumbai airport’s runways obstruct the flow of the Mithi river. The first runway, along with the taxiway, extends over a culvert on the river while the second encroaches upon the river itself. When the river flooded in 2005, the airport had to be closed.

Chennai

In 2011, the Chennai airport’s second runway covered a culvert on the Adyar river. In December 2015, when heavy rainfall led to water from the Chembarambakkam lake being released into the Adyar, the airport was one of the first major installations to be completely flooded.

Jaipur

Jaipur’s second runway was completed in 2016. Like in Chennai and Mumbai, the runway was extended on a water channel connecting a series of tanks in the city.

Tirupati

The airport in Renigunta is built between a series of tanks. As these maps show, it encroaches on lake beds, which are also threatened by much built-up growth and plotted development.

Visakhapatnam

The entire roof of the Visakhapatnam airport was damaged in the 2014 Hudhud cyclone. India’s eastern coast is prone to strong cyclonic winds. Why was the roof not designed to withstand them?

Navi Mumbai

Not learning from disasters recent and past, the Rs 16,000 crore Navi Mumbai International Airport is being built by filling and diverting the Ulwe river flowing into the Panvel creek. The landfilling is already causing flooding in nearby villages.

New Delhi

The airport’s swanky new terminal, T3, was built on one of the lowest points of the chosen site. The graph below represents the cross section along the red line marking the location of Terminal 3. It shows that when it rains, water from surrounding higher grounds flows to this point, the reason for the airport’s flooding in 2011 and 2013.

G N Chetty Road flyover will have a vertical garden soon

A vertical garden around the piers of the GN Chetty Road flyover is being planned at a cost of 32 lakhs. The proposal was ratified by the Chennai Smart City Limited board on Tuesday. According to corporation documents, the decision to develop a vertical garden was taken to prevent defacement to the piers by unscrupulous elements, who stick posters in the dead of the night. According to an official from the Corporation, this vertical garden will beautify the flyover and allow them to utilise space around the piers effectively. The project will be executed using the Smart City funds allocated for Chennai.

Chennai water situation may not be as scary as Niti Aayog warns

Strongly disagreeing with Niti Aayog’s recent statement that Chennai would be among the 21 cities in the country to run out of groundwater by 2020, Santha Sheela Nair, a former civil servant, says that the situation is not as alarming as it is made out to be, if one is to go by the groundwater numbers of the city for the past 15 years.

“In 2003, when the city was in the midst of a huge water crisis, the average water level below the ground was around 5.6 metres. But, that was also the year people of the city started implementing RWH, going the whole hog. In three years, the level improved to 3.17 metres,” explains Ms. Nair, who promoted RWH during her stint as Chairman and Managing Director of Chennai Metrowater, and as Secretary in the Municipal Administration & Water Supply Department in the State government.

Tamil Nadu hospitals to submit report on fire safety mechanism by July 6th

The Tamil Nadu government has asked the Joint Directors of health services to submit a report before July 6th regarding fire safety and regular preparedness for emergencies in all private and government hospitals. It is learnt that the PWD, Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services, Directorate of Town and Country Planning department, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, Electricity board and other departments have been asked to help the joint directors in submitting the report.

The report should focus on recommendations, compliance with fire safety guidelines, training to staff and other remedial measures and time required to overcome the gaps.

The Directorate of Health Services has issued advisories for the public and medical workers in relief camps regarding measures to be taken during the floods and after. They cover treatment of injuries as well as control of communicable diseases, which is a major threat in the aftermath of a flood.

The department has advised the people to take these precautions:

Consume only safe drinking water, preferably boiled.

Wash hands frequently with soap and water to prevent infection.

Do not consume food soaked with the floodwaters.

Anyone developing fever or diarrhoea should seek treatment at government health facilities, including medical camps, and refrain from self-treatment. If clustering of diarrhea cases – more than three cases in one locality – is found, a nearby health facility should be informed.

Doctors have also advised the people against wading through the floodwaters as far as possible as this could expose them to leptospirosis, a bacterial infection passed on to humans through contact with urine of animals such as dogs, rodents and livestock.

The health department has also issued guidelines for local authorities on handling the clean-up after the floodwaters recede, including on dumping of waste, disinfecting flooded areas, cleaning sources of drinking water, chlorinating water, ensuring oral rehydration of those who require it, and preventing food poisoning, mosquito-borne diseases and snake bites.

The guidelines point out that flood-affected people are likely to suffer psychological problems and ask the local authorities to conduct special camps for them wherever necessary.

Risk of malaria, diarrhoea

The health risks from a flood are of two kinds – the acute and immediate like injury, trauma, dehydration from lack of drinking water, and those that can manifest later like outbreaks of infection.

Dr Mala Ramanathan at the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, said Kerala is likely to be vulnerable to malaria and diarrhoea in particular in the coming weeks. “While the state has had to handle more exotic diseases like Nipah, more common things like malaria and diarrhoea could be a problem,” she said. “We are used to handling dengue, chikungunya and leptospirosis, but not cholera and diarrhoea which can particularly affect children because these diseases have been eliminated in the state and so have not been on the health authorities’ radar for primary healthcare systems.”

Ramanathan added that the people are unlikely to drink contaminated water unless they are in situations where it is the last resort. This is because literacy is quite high and almost everyone is aware of the risks. By way of example, she said residents of the Thiruvananthapuram suburb of Thirumala who do not have drinking water have been been catching rain water directly in clean buckets and using this safe water for drinking and cooking.

“Leptospirosis is definitely the bigger risk because everyone is wading through water and they don’t have much of a choice,” said Ramanathan.

In Palakkad, where the floodwaters receded on Saturday, more than 10,000 people have been evacuated to 90 relief camps. The local parliamentarian MB Rajesh said the “health situation” is under control so far and there is no need for panic. “Medical teams are working at all relief camps round the clock,” he said. “As of now there is no outbreak. There have minor infections and doctors are treating those. We have sufficient medicines.”

He added that the district administration has already begun a massive campaign to clean houses and water sources.

Another big threat is that of injury. “In flood situations there is a lot of flowing water and there tend to be sharp objects like broken wood and glass that cause injuries and accidents,” said Vijayprasad Gopichandran, assistant professor of community medicine at ESIC Medical College and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Science and Research in Chennai who witnessed several such cases when the city was flooded in December 2015.

Lessons from the Chennai floods

Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu faced devastating floods in November and December of 2015. The state was lauded for preventing outbreak of infections in the weeks and months after the disaster through a number of preventive measures and coordinated action.

The state’s health authorities conducted medical camps and preventive screening at all relief camps. They set up mobile medical camps to reach interior areas hit by the floods and referred necessary cases to government hospitals. The state stocked up on three and a half months’ worth of medicines and procured oxygen on an emergency basis from Karnataka.

Chennai’s water authority doubled the amount of chlorination of water sources while the city corporation liberally spread bleaching powder, a disinfectant, in the affected areas. Moreover, every household was provided half a kilogram of bleaching powder and 20 chlorine tablets.

The authorities issued public health advisories, distributed free sanitary napkins to women and girls, and deployed health inspectors in villages. Relief workers and the people exposed to injuries were given tetanus vaccination as well as protective gloves and masks. Surveillance teams were formed to watch out for possible outbreaks of diseases.

As disastrous as the 2015 floods were, Tamil Nadu was able to pull in resources from districts which were unaffected. In Kerala, however, almost all districts have suffered widespread devastation and it may have to depend on support from its neighbours and from the Centre.

Specialised healthcare services

Leena Joshi, former director of the non-profit Apnalaya, remembers the psychological damage people suffered when Mumbai flooded in July 2005. “The people, particularly women, suffer quite a lot,” she said. “They are anxious about their families members who have been stranded or with whom they do not have contact for a long time. Even children suffer from traumatic experiences. They may also have physical symptoms because these are psychosomatic.”

Joshi said medical relief teams can and do offer psychological support through their volunteers who are not necessarily doctors or health workers but who are willing to hear people out.

Gopichandran pointed out that in times of disaster, routine healthcare services take a beating. “In December 2015, I would go to relief camps where people would come for their diabetes medicines because they could not access their regular supply,” he said.

It is crucial, Gopichandran said, to ensure there is no inordinate interruption in critical healthcare programmes such as for tuberculosis and HIV. “One thing that needs to be kept in mind is it is not enough if we mobilise doctors,” he explained. “The actual work is done by nurses, sanitation workers and so on. Kerala will have to mobilise these kinds of people in large numbers.”

Ramanathan already feels the need for one kind of specialised health workers in Thiruvananthapuram. “Right now, at hospitals we are looking for pharmacists to volunteer to help,” she said. “We have huge supplies of medicines that have been donated but these are all mixed up. We need people with medical knowledge to sort these out.”",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The lush, coastal state of Kerala in the southernmost part of India is no stranger to heavy rainfall. The monsoon season brings an average of 2,700 mm of rain to the state¹, which is more than what the Philippines gets annually². This year’s monsoon season, however, wasn’t average.

The monsoons soaked Kerala with above average rainfall for two months, and then delivered an immense spike. In the first 19 days of August, 758 mm of rain poured over Kerala — 164% above normal³. In a few days, more rain fell over this state the size of Switzerland than what falls over the US in a year⁴.

Intense monsoon rainfall over Kerala, August 2018

Kerala was inundated. There were widespread floods and thousands of landslides. The disaster killed over 480 people and affected nearly 5.4 million. A massive response operation was mobilized by the government, civil society, private sector, and local fishermen. Over 260,000 were evacuated and more than 1.4 million were provided shelter in 3,200+ relief camps.

At the request of the Government of India — the Government of Kerala, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank conducted a Joint Rapid Disaster Needs Assessment to quantify the damage and assess the long-term recovery needs. Considering the impact on housing, infrastructure, utilities, livelihoods, health, environment, and cultural heritage — the estimated recovery cost is about US$ 3.5 billion⁵, just for the priority sectors.

This scale of damage from floods is not an outlier for India. The average annual loss from floods in the country is estimated to be US$ 7.4 billion⁶.

Disasters causing damages of over a billion US dollars, 1993–2018

In recent years, extreme rainfall has also caused flash floods in India’s major cities — including in Mumbai (2005), Srinagar (2014), and Chennai (2015). The impact of climate change and rapid, unregulated urban growth has further exacerbated the risk of floods for India’s urban centers⁷.

Building long-term resilience

Ten years before the Kerala deluge, on August 18, 2008 the Kosi river broke its embankment and flooded the populous state of Bihar — where one in three people are still in poverty. 493 people died and three million families in the state were affected, many losing their homes and all their assets.

At the government’s request, the World Bank and GFDRR conducted a flood needs assessment and initiated the Bihar Kosi Flood Recovery Project in 2010. This 8-year project helped rebuild houses and critical infrastructure, and also supported the restoration of livelihoods of the affected people.

To build long-term resilience, this was followed by the ongoing Bihar Kosi Basin Development Project. This project is enhancing the Bihar Water Resources Department’s capacity to manage flood risk. It is also helping farmers in the region to enhance agriculture productivity and improve the market access of their crops.

World Bank’s ongoing flood resilience activities, September 2018

Subsequently, when the Himalayan states of Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir were hit by devastating floods in 2013 and 2014 respectively — rapid post-disaster needs assessments guided the set up of the Uttarakhand Disaster Recovery Project and the Jhelum and Tawi Flood Recovery Project.

These projects are helping the state disaster management authorities to (a) ‘build back better’ and (b) to develop long-term resilience, response, and governance capacities. In addition to these flood resilience projects, GFDRR has also supported cooperation between India’s Central Water Commission and the Japan Water Agency in improving dam safety guidelines for India⁸.

Supporting Kerala’s flood recovery

For Kerala, the World Bank is looking to extend support to the Government of Kerala’s comprehensive flood recovery efforts and to build greater resilience to future shocks⁹. The support is subject to Government of India’s formal request and approval by the World Bank Board of Governors.

“The framework we have prepared in consultation with the Government of Kerala will help the state with early recovery needs restoring the infrastructure and livelihoods. A very important part of our engagement will be to support the work of state institutions and build on the state-community relationships that exist in Kerala.” - Junaid Ahmad, World Bank Country Director in India

The proposed recovery and resilience framework will follow a phased approach. First phase will attempt to address early recovery needs and setting the stage for a resilient recovery. To build resilience to future shocks, the second phase would focus on policy and institution strengthening in the state, taking a long-term view to reduce flood risk in India.

To help Kerala manage financial impacts of future disasters, the framework also defines innovative financial solutions, such as diaspora bonds and insurance, and includes measures to mainstream resilience into sectoral investments.

The Chennai floods of 2015 saw many individuals and associations coming together to reach out to the needy and ever since, there has been a steady increase in the rise of citizen movements. Taking cue from this, the Chennai Corporation has now rolled out the carpet for individuals and groups to enrol as volunteers with the Chennai Corporation.

All you have to do is fill in a form that is available on www.chennai.corporation.gov.in or with the respective zonal offices. The volunteering service will mainly be related to relief and rescue operations in the city and its outskirts during emergency situations like flood. The civic body prefers retired defence personnel and those who have prior experience in community services.

Once registered, the names of individuals and associations will be linked to their respective zonal offices. This will be purely voluntary and no identity cards or proof of service is being planned by the civic body.

Chennai Corporation to restore 10 water bodies along with CREDAI

The water bodies in Ambattur, Valsaravakaam, Alandur, Perungudi and Sholinganallur are soon expected to regain lost glory, thanks to the MoU signed between CREDAI and Chennai Corporation. Under the initiative, the floors of the lakes and ponds will be cleaned, the area fenced and trees will planted around these water bodies.

There are 210 water bodies in the city and according to the Corporation officials, within a span of one year, close to 100 water bodies have been restored. As part of the smart city initiative, the storm water drain department has taken up the restoration.

Southern Railways reduces MRTS service frequency

When the Tamil Nadu Government increased bus fares, commuters had turned to MRTS in a big way, with the suburban rail routes serving up to 10 lakh passengers. But Southern Railways has been phasing out operations of some trains and the frequency of some others have been reduced over a period of time. Additional services were started to meet the demand of passengers, who took trains due to low fares.

Beginning this month, passengers travelling in Chengalpet Tambaram Beach route and Velachery Beach MRTS have to wait a little longer as there will be fewer services operational. However, a new special has been introduced from Kanchipuram to Beach at 6:10 am.

Chennai Corporation to facilitate NOCs from various departments

For regularisation of plots, one need not run from pillar to post any more to get NOC from various departments nor endure unduly long waits. Chennai corporation has now taken the ownership of granting NOC, layout-wise. Plot owners applying for regularisation have to obtain no objection from PWD, AAI, Housing Board etc for their plots in the vicinity of the land owned by these bodies. At a recent meeting held by the civic body, it was decided that the latter will co-ordinate the efforts of various departments to obtain no objection for entire layouts instead of individual plots.

The report has neither been presented before the government-constituted committee nor tabled in the assembly,” he said. “I think the report has pointed out shortfalls in government response to flood management. That is why it has not been tabled in the assembly,” said Stalin, moving a calling attention motion.He reminded the House about the enormous loss suffered by residents of Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts after water was released from the Chembarambakkam Lake without prior warning, resulting in the flooding of the city’s waterways. “The finance minister (O Panneerselvam ) must hand over the report to the governor, who, in turn, should order that it be tabled in the House,” said Stalin.In his reply, deputy chief minister Panneerselvam said the CAG had sent the report without taking into account the state’s replies to certain queries raised by it. The government has sought the opinion of the advocate general on tabling the report in the assembly, he said.The performance audit was conducted between May and October 2016. Revenue, PWD, local administration and water supply and housing departments and collectors of Chennai, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram were included in the audit.“The objective of CAG’s performance audit is to ascertain whether the state government has given importance to protecting water bodies, whether there is adequate infrastructure for rainwater to flow easily in the channels and whether steps were taken to remove encroachments hindering the flow,” said Panneerselvam.The deputy chief minister assured the House that all the discrepancies mentioned in the CAG report will be sent to respective departments for action. “We have sought the advice of state advocate general on whether to place the CAG report on the 2015 floods in the assembly. Based on the advice we will take a decision,” said Panneerselvam.The deputy chief minister said the government has not violated any act or provision with regard to the CAG report. “We have clearly mentioned the dates on which the correspondence between the state government and CAG took place. The practice is to discuss the discrepancies with the government and then publish the audit report.

Names of places in Chennai are more than just geographical markers. They bring out what Chennai was not too long ago. Lake Area, Tank Bund Road and Eri Scheme are a few pointers that tell us how bountiful the city was in water resources.

Even as recently as in the 1950s, you could drive down Mount Road from Saidapet to Teynampet through what became CIT Nagar, bank left near where Gemini Flyover stands now, hop on to Tank Bund Road and continue motoring along, never too far away from water.

Cut to 2018: Chennai is all built-up and the names of places are just fluid reminders of the past.

It’s almost summer and the anxiety of Chennaiites is mounting. Despite official assurances, they are worried about how the supply of water will pan out. Today, motoring across roads means conducting tricky negotiations with water tankers that dominate not just our streets but other types of water supply too.

As the global community commemorated World Water Day recently as a reminder to use nature to overcome challenges and discussed the approaching ‘Day Zero’ in Cape Town, which is caught in the throes of a severe drought, Chennaiites recognise that their city is also part of the rather dismal scene. Rapid and unplanned urbanisation has systematically destroyed waterbodies, which act as sponges and help mitigate floods.

If the process is left unchecked, Chennai could soon be heading towards an ecological disaster.

Studying depletion

A study by the Department of Geology, Anna University, based on a city map of 1893, has revealed that there were nearly 60 large waterbodies in the core of then Madras. The study traced the shrinking and vanished waterbodies through a series of city maps.

In 2017, the number of waterbodies, both large and small, came down to 28.

Source: Department of Geology, Anna University

The historical map was sourced from the city maps prepared by the Edinburgh Geographical Institute in 1893. The rest of the maps were sourced through land satellite images, according to the team from Anna University.

“We found that the area of the waterbodies had shrunk rapidly after 1960 and there were drastic changes in the number of lakes or ponds in the core part of the city with every passing decade,” said Samurembi Chanu, a research scholar who was part of the team. The study covered the areas between Kodungaiyur, Tondiarpet and Guindy that formed the core parts of then Madras.

L. Elango, a member of the faculty at Department of Geology, Anna University, and vice-president of the International Association of Hydrogeologists (Indian chapter), said the area of the waterbodies in the city and suburbs had shrunk from nearly 12.6 sq. km in 1893 to about 3.2 sq. km in 2017, mainly due to urbanisation.

“The 1893 map indicates the presence of a crescent-shaped waterbody from the present CIT Nagar, Teynampet, Gemini flyover to Nungambakkam along the then Mount Road. The waterbodies, namely Mylapur tank and Nungambakkam tank, covered a distance of nearly 7 km,” he said.

The study aimed at checking the implications of urbanisation and climate change over ground and surface water resources and how the shrinking of open spaces had reduced groundwater recharge.

“Vysarpadi Lake, Perambur tank, Medavakkam tank and Spurtank were some of the large waterbodies that were replaced by buildings after the 1950s. While Nandanam was along the lake bund, the present CIT Colony was a waterbody during the 1950s. Kilpauk too had big waterbodies. Many small waterbodies in north Chennai near Tondiarpet have been wiped off city maps due to encroachment and urbanisation, particularly from the 1970s. There were a few ponds near Ice House too. The Madras Zoo that was located behind Ripon building and was later shifted to Vandalur in 1980s had a huge waterbody inside,” said Mr. Elango.

Impact on groundwater

The study estimated the depleting volume of water harvested and the loss of groundwater recharge as more waterbodies vanished over the decades. “We estimated that if the average depth of lakes and ponds was 2 metres and filled twice during a year, the volume of surface water stored has dipped from 1,335 million cubic feet (mcft) in 1893 to 339 mcft in 2017, going by the shrinking water spread area,” he said.

The vanished waterbodies and open spaces also mean a drastic drop in groundwater recharge potential, according to the study.

The rapid loss of natural resources has induced local flooding and increased saltwater intrusion in the coastal belt, noted water experts. They recalled a research project of IIT-Madras that estimated the existence of 650 waterbodies in the Chennai region till the late 1970s.

Every episode of local flooding in the city can be traced to a vanished waterbody in the neighbourhoodM. KarmegamFormer director, Centre for Water Resources, Anna University

S.P. Chairman, retired engineer, Water Resources Department, said some of the railway stations, including in Kodambakkam and Nungambakkam, were developed over lakes. A sizeable chunk of Chennai Central railway station was built above the Buckingham canal. Several ponds in Kolathur have yielded to infrastructure development.

“Until the 1960s, there was a big lake in Perambur on the site now developed as a park beneath the flyover. Low-level areas face inundation as lakes have been destroyed. The industrial estates in Guindy and Ambattur were also water bodies,” he said.

Man-made flooding

The Chennai floods of 2015 were a clear indicator of mismanagement of lakes and negligence in protecting linking channels. M. Karmegam, former director, Centre for Water Resources, Anna University, recalled that there was a chain of 16 tanks in Vyasarpadi, among which was the one in Kodungaiyur. After 1950, many have been turned into settlements, including in Ayapakkam and Koladi. The Public Works Department used to maintain tank memoirs with hydraulic details of tanks during the British period. Every episode of local flooding in the city can be traced to a vanished waterbody in the neighbourhood, he added.

Waterbodies have a role in temperature regulation, prevention of water-borne diseases and groundwater stabilisationArun KrishnamurthiEnvironmentalist Foundation of India

Environmental activists noted that the trend was not new to the suburbs either. Arun Krishnamurthy, Founder of Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI), noted that small ponds were easy prey as there weren't any proper revenue records. Ponds have been closed to build overhead tanks in Tiruvottiyur, Palavakkam and Thoraipakkam.

“There are different versions of documentation on waterbodies which were denotified during changes in land-use pattern. Every waterbody has a role in temperature regulation, prevention of water-borne diseases and groundwater stabilisation,” he said.

Coping with the loss

EFI is now involved in rejuvenating smaller ponds to sustain the ecological balance in areas such as Madhavaram, Gerugambakkam, Sholinganallur and Mudichur. With intense rainfall in short spells predicted to increase and bring more rainwater runoff in the city, experts call for a restoration of shrinking waterbodies and monitoring of rainwater harvesting on a large scale.

Officials claim they will complete pending work before the start of northeast monsoon. Residents, who faced major brunt of 2015 flood, have urged officials to accelerate works.

Sources said there are 15 corporation zones under the control of GCC and even after the floods in 2015, the corporation officials miserably failed to take effective stormwater drainage system.

Even as officials took up such works in many areas, they have not completed and in some places there are only trenches posing threats to the public and motorists.

An official of Ambattur zone said, “Works are being done in a phased manner and since such works are taken up along the arterial roads, there will be some delay owing to heavy traffic jam. So, workers are pressed into services during night time.” The official exuded confidence that all the works relating to storm water will come to end soon.

However, residents still fume over pending works. “The officials do not seem to have learned a lesson or two from the past instances in terms of storm water drainage and sewage system management. Both city and suburbs, which were marooned during 2015-floods lack proper drainage system,” said P Viswanathan, coordinator of Chitlapakkam Residents Welfare Association.

If there is a heavy rain for at least half an hour, all main roads become water-logged in a quick succession, indicating ineffective stormwater drainage system, Viswanathan noted.

When contacted, a senior corporation official, on conditions of anonymity, said, “We have continuously been undertaking storm water drainage works and will complete them before the onset of north-east monsoon. We have also instructed zonal officials to monitor such works and submit the reports soon.”

When asked about left out trenches, the official quipped, “those trenches are dug for carrying out works and are not left out half.

As the water recedes in Kerala this question will, and should, surface. Having killed at least 370 people, displaced 780,000 and caused ₹ 50,000 crore worth of damage, this is the worst flood Kerala has witnessed in nearly a century. Back in 1924, a combination of heavy rain and a breached dam triggered deadly floods that claimed 1,000 lives. In 2018, history may have repeated itself. Under relentless downpours, poor dam management may have aggravated the floods, raising questions about the role of dams in Kerala and other states.

In India’s quest to control water, dams have always loomed large. India is home to more than 5,000 large dams (over 15 metre high), the third largest number in the world, behind the US and China. While only a handful of these dams (28) are built explicitly for flood control, in theory, they all have the properties to minimize flood damage. Dams can manage rivers, storing their water, adjusting flows and redirecting channels.

Kerala is home to 53 large dams with a collective capacity of nearly 7 trillion litres. As rain poured and rivers overflowed, these dams should have served as a bulwark. James Wilson, an officer with the Kerala state water agency, estimated that the Idukki and Idamalayar dams (the two biggest) together have stored 21.3% of the Periyar’s (Kerala’s longest river) annual flow, greatly limiting the flood’s damage.

But for dams to truly tame floods, experts say dam reservoirs need to be relatively empty before the onset of rains. According to Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network for Dams, Rivers and People, this was not the case in Kerala. The Idukki dam was already near full capacity by July-end even as rains were relatively weak (below normal levels) during that period.

When the downpours arrived in August, the near full-capacity Idukki was forced to release water into already flooded areas. Thakkar believes this lack of foresight is common in India’s dam management and has worsened floods across the country. “Filling up the reservoirs before the end of the monsoon is an invitation to disaster,"" he said over phone, adding that “while dams can help control floods, they need to be managed properly"".

More than half of Kerala’s dams (57%) are hydroelectric projects operated by the Kerala State Electricity Board; the rest are operated by the irrigation department. For both entities, the amount of water to store is motivated by demand for electricity and irrigation, rather than flood control measures.

These floods also raise another recurring, unresolved issue in Indian dam operations: inter-state dam management.

Like many dams in India, the Mullaperiyar is located in one state (Kerala), but operated by another (Tamil Nadu). Both state governments have been in constant conflict over the dam’s water level—in the current crisis, the Supreme Court had to intervene.

Beyond dam mismanagement, some environmentalists are pointing to other man-made issues, such as urban development and quarrying. In Kerala, much of which sits on the Western Ghats, development activity can increase the chances of landslides—the biggest source of fatalities in floods.

The 2011 Western Ghats ecology expert panel (the Madhav Gadgil Committee report) had labelled areas of the state as extremely ecologically-sensitive where no developmental activities should take place. According to Gadgil, unchecked quarrying and construction in these areas caused these floods. Data from the state’s disaster management control room show that flood casualties and injuries are widespread, but there is some concentration in the few ecologically sensitive areas.

Idukki and Thrissur were marked as sensitive and account for 30% of total casualties and injuries. However, other sensitive areas (Kollam and Wayanad) were less affected although they also received very heavy rains.

OPINION | Kerala floods: An unprecedented tragedy foretold

The Gadgil report was sceptical about dams, warning against their construction in the Western Ghats. But most of Gadgil’s recommendations were rejected as too impractical, highlighting the tension between dams and development. Proponents see dams as critical for Indian farmers’ sustenance and renewable energy generation. While the costs and benefits of new dams may be unclear, for existing dams, what is clear is that their management can, and must improve, to limit damages during extreme weather events.

Kerala is merely the latest victim of poor dam management: several of India’s floods, such as Bihar in 2016 and Surat in 2006, were exacerbated by poor dam management. In the 2015 Chennai floods, which claimed 295 lives, violation of dam safety norms were a critical factor, a CAG report found.

On December 1, 2015 Chennai and its surrounding regions experienced an unprecedented, heavy rainfall. In a region where the average rainfall during the season is expected to be 8-10 mm per day, one of the rain gauges in the city recorded an abnormally high, 494 mm, rainfall over 24 hours that day. This led to death of nearly 250 people, and Chennai was declared a ‘disaster zone’. There have been attempts to explain this phenomenon of how clouds remained stationary over this region, continuously giving rain over 24 hours. In a first, Jayesh Phadtare of Centre for Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, links the presence of the Eastern Ghats to this phenomenon, in a paper published in Monthly Weather Review.

Cold pool

When clouds give out water droplets, the droplets evaporate mid-air, as they fall down. This cools the surrounding air, forming a cold pool of air which sinks down and flows horizontally. “The gusty cold wind that heralds an approaching thunderstorm is nothing but a cold pool, which plays a pivotal role in cloud dynamics.” says Jayesh.

Unlike the Western Ghats, which run close to the west coast of India, the Eastern Ghats are nearly 200 km away from the coast. Therefore, the link between the mountains’ orography and the rainfall over the region is not obvious, and this is the first study to link the two. Jayesh, who is studying cloud propagation over the Indian region, could see the connection by observing satellite images: “In Kalpana-I satellite images, I saw that the clouds that gave so much rain over Chennai on 1 December 2015 moved from Bay of Bengal to the coast and became stationary there,” he says. Realising that the Eastern Ghats must be having a role in this, he went on to study a model of the system. “The interaction between mountains, clouds and cold pools became clear after performing the model experiments,” he adds, in an email to The Hindu.

According to the model, the cold pool was obstructed by the Eastern Ghats from flowing downward. Hence it piled up and remained stationary over the Chennai region. “The reason for the clouds remaining stationary was that there was a balance between the piling of cold pool along the mountain and the winds from the bay. This does not happen in all heavy rainfall incidences over Chennai,” says Jayesh.

Sensitivity experiments were done to check this model. In the experimental model in which the orography was absent, the winds just swept downstream and the clouds moved inland. In the model where the evaporative cooling was removed, the cold pool did not form at all and the clouds moved over the Ghats.

Dust storms

Cold pools are known to play an important role in the dust storms (Aandhi) that form in northern India. They form by the evaporation of raindrops. This process is more efficient in the drier and warmer environment as there is lot of scope of evaporation. So, the cold pools that form in these conditions, are deeper and more vigorous. “As pre-monsoon conditions in north India are very dry and warm, cold pools that accompany the pre-monsoon thunderstorms there are far more destructive, causing widespread damages,” says Jayesh. For the first time, this study links cold pools and the mountain structure to explain rainfall over south India.

Though the primary aim of the study is to explain the anomalous rainfall over Chennai on December 1, 2015, ""the understanding gained from this analysis can be useful for improving the general weather forecast over this region,” the author writes in the paper.",issue,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 2, 2015","Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",494 mm,250+ deaths,,Declared a 'disaster zone',"The floods were caused by an unprecedented, heavy rainfall.

In the first week of December 2015, Chennai saw unprecedented flooding as a result of heavy rainfall. Citizens banded together to rescue others stranded in their homes as the water levels rose to alarming levels. We take a look some scenes from the floods that devastated many lives and caused untold destruction to properties.

The storm brought life to a standstill and almost everyone experienced some kind of loss. Thousands were left homeless and vulnerable, at the mercy of the weather and the charity of good samaritans.

The lack of warning of the floods in Chennai made it especially difficult for people with disabilities, who were left to fend for themselves. While some needed rescuing , others lost essential implements like hearing aids, crutches and calipers, leaving them more vulnerable than ever before.

Across the city, people found pets lost on the roads . In many cases, they were washed away, or ran out when the water started rising. Many were rescued by the SPCA and the animal rescue volunteers.

Though cyclones, depressions and storms are an annual occurrence in Chennai, some years like 1985, when former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran was evacuated from his Ramapuram garden home, or 1976, when the Army stepped in to keep the Manali oil refinery running, are unforgettable.

Chembarambakkam Lake, which is blamed for the city’s flooding, was once the lifeline of South Chennai as it irrigated 168 villages in the district while the North of Chennai benefited from Puzhal Lake. However, plundering of the waterbodies, including the lake, led to the uprooting of livelihoods and homes over a vast area.

Fishermen from Kovalam and Semmanchery helped people reach Kovalam and Kelambakkam after a portion of the road connecting these two places was washed away by the floods.

The Saidapet bridge, a part of the arterial Anna Salai went under as waters rose.

This has exacerbated the flooding caused by rains since Thursday. Fishermen venturing into the sea have been warned and advised not to go into the sea for fishing. North east monsoon is strengthening and officials have predicted more rain and thunder showers to continue for next three days in most places over the northern coast, Southern Tamil Nadu including Chennai city.

The southern district of coastal Tamil Nadu have recorded heavier showers in last 24 hours.

According to local authorities five people are recorded to have died due to heavy rain related incidents. Two eight year old girls were electrocuted while playing outside their home in Kodungaiur as the electricity lines fell into the water.

The floods have put the district in a state of crisis. The flood affected persons find themselves in a desperate situation, with many unmet vital humanitarian needs such as access to: food, safe shelter and non food items. The rains and the flooding has meant that people have lost their livelihoods and dependent on external support. There is need for sufficient food, safe shelter and basic non-food items. The dire situation is further compounded for the flood affected people with vulnerabilities especially for those people discriminated because of caste.

The people of Chennai responded admirably to the climate crisis unleashed by unprecedented rains in November-December 2015, but the city is yet to build upon the lessons it learnt during the subsequent floods

Indian cities are starting to look boringly similar on the ground. The roads look similar, and so do some of the malls, buildings, apartment complexes and shops. Watching a city while approaching it in an aircraft, train or by road gives a perspective on the landscape on which it is built upon.

Landing at Chennai, one would see many irrigation tanks. These are usually depressions in which a mud or masonry wall has been constructed at the deep end, with a spillway allowing excess water to flow back into the stream. Downstream, not very far from this tank, would be another, for which the inlet stream will be from the outlet of the earlier one. These networks of water bodies are visible when driving into the city from the adjoining Thiruvallur or Chengelput districts.

There were many lakes in Chennai, which have mostly been built in over the decades. The four rivers traversing from west to east have had their flood plains constructed over. The Buckingham Canal that runs through the city on a north-south axis has constrictions in its path. The complex of wetlands near the Pallikaranai marsh has disappeared to a significant extent.

Ecological fault lines

The end-2015 flood highlighted these ecological fault lines. The floods hits those areas worst that were once part of the wetland and water body network. The southern localities around the Pallikaranai marsh were the worst hit. Even in other localities, those who were not even aware that they were living on former lakebeds realised the flood water was higher in their homes than in other areas. The flood along the Adayar river spared none in its path, including the super rich, slum dwellers, patients in intensive care units of a hospital, and a housing complex built for senior civil servants.

The city responded in interesting ways. Somewhere, there was an inherent resilience built in, which came into effect during the crisis. A study on Chennai’s resilience prepared by IFMR Lead and TARU Leading Edge for the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network shows that in addition to response by the fire services, police force and the National Disaster Management Agency, there were many innovative responses.

For instance, the report states that to reach food to the stranded, a restaurant called Kolapasi opened its kitchen and delivery systems. At a time 300 volunteers cooked for 170,000 people. Volunteers ranged from university students to businessmen, and even the elderly helped in the kitchen. They used social media to raise funds and identify where to take the food. The report also notes a supermarket chain stored and supplied essential commodities at a reduced price so as to help families recover.

To help families start their kitchens as early as possible, Servals Pvt Ltd, a company that specialises in energy-efficient stoves, supplied their units to families that were outside the government’s distribution networks.

Call a boat

The most innovative move was by call taxi aggregator Ola, which turned itself into a call boat aggregator during the flood. They commissioned small fishing boats and vessels to help rescue people and also doubled as a call boat taxi service. The image of fishing boats with Ola stickers became one of the iconic images from the floods. The picture of a well-known industrialist escaping the floods on a fishing boat from his estate on the banks of the Adayar river was another iconic image from the floods.

It was the social and informal media that took centre-stage during the floods. Messages shared on Facebook, Twitter and other sites helped save lives, rescue people and reach food to those stranded. These worked from outside the city and from those localities where power and telephone connectivity returned comparatively quickly.

Bengaluru had become the operations centre for much of this. Arun Ganesh, a digital mapmaker, along with his friend designed a crowd-sourced map where residents could feed information on how deep water was at any point on any street. This was launched on December 1, 2015, and was immediately picked up by Chennai residents. At any given time during the floods there were at least 100 people accessing it. Flooding was reported from 15,000 road segments and in the two weeks of its launch it had registered 1.2 million views.

People from Chennai working outside the state wanted to pitch in. A group of Indian Administrative Service officers from Tamil Nadu working in other states got together and started a call centre in Bengaluru. It was established at the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board office by the then managing director P. Manivannan. Helping him to work at the call centre were young professionals from Chennai working in Bengaluru. They knew the geography of Chennai, and were well placed to receive distress calls and direct relief.

Weather watcher

Pradeep John, an amateur weather watcher, found great traction for his Facebook posts and tweets. He had practical advice on when the next spell of rain was coming, how intense it would be and how long it would last. John became an overnight celebrity, and his postings under the name of Tamil Nadu Weatherman has an increasing number of followers ever since.

Radio jockey Balaji, actor Siddharth and singer Chinmayi formed another group that aggregated calls for help through social media and directed help to where it was needed. The social media momentum continued when the city faced other extreme weather events such as Cyclone Vardah and the drought of summer 2017. It was also used as the youth of Tamil Nadu congregated at the Marina Beach to protest against the ban on traditional bull racing, or jallikattu.

Did Chennai learn from the crisis and take steps to deal with future events? Although the rains were not as severe as that during end-2015, exactly a year later when Cyclone Vardah struck, municipal authorities were quicker with their response. With gale winds reaching 140 km per hour, Vardah brought down nearly 20,000 trees in the city. The corporation could clear these trees off the roads in the next few days. Also, power, phone and Internet connectivity were restored faster.

Stop the mafia

But this still does not mean that the city will not flood with the next rains. A Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Chennai floods notes in its report on August 12, 2016, that the encroachment of lakes and river beds played a major role in causing the floods. “The Committee feels that the State Government should check the mafia involved in illegal construction for business and usurping water bodies for their real estate business. The flood channels and riverbed should be cleared as soon as possible by removing illegal/unauthorized constructions.”

Obviously, this has not happened. The river channels have been dredged and widened in some places, but the river mouths (including the mouth of Pallikaranai marsh at Muthukadu) continue to be blocked by sand bars.

The government authorities had argued before the committee that since the end-2015 flood was a one-in-a-hundred-year event, it would be impossible to prevent the damages. The parliamentarians found this unacceptable. “The Committee does not quite accept the argument that since the rainfall was unprecedented and was more than the hundred years average therefore the damage was also huge.”

The citizens of Chennai are scared because rain events of even lesser intensity have been causing waterlogging and floods in the past few years. The further the city moves from the original landscape on which it was built, greater is the risk of floods.

Chennai is no stranger to heavy rains and cyclonic storms as it is very much located along the highly volatile coast of Bay of Bengal. However, massive flooding and water logging within a span of few days of torrential rains has become almost a recurring phenomenon. Global warming, unplanned urban development and unwieldy growth with no hydrological plan are some of the reasons that have been cited as the prime reason for the threat of a massive devastation. How far is this true?

Generally, when there is heavy rain, it is the natural lakes, ponds, tanks, rivers and inter-linked drainage systems that help replenish the groundwater, hold back some water and release the excess to the ocean. And for a state like Tamil Nadu, which is not only home to about 41,127 tanks but is also characterised by a vast network of small water bodies, instances of vast areas getting inundated is indeed puzzling.

Why haven’t the major rivers such as the Cooum, Adyar and Buckhingham Canal, which serve as the main canal water drainage for the city, not able to drain out the excess of rainwater? What has happened to the Pallikaranai marsh which acts as a sponge to soak up the excess of rainwater?

Chennai’s original terrain consists of many lakes and marshy areas. The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE, 2015) reports that the city had more than 600 small water bodies in 1980s. Each of these small water bodies had a natural flood discharge channel which used to drain the spillover. But currently, only a fraction of them could be found healthy. Lamentably, they have not disappeared but have been encroached upon to make way for concrete structures.

What may have been a tank/ pond some 20 years ago is today a site of multi-storey residential or industrial structure. For instance, Chennai’s airport is built entirely on the floodplains of Adyar river; the city’s elevated railway has come up along the stretches of Buckingham Canal. While the actual number of breaches is probably much higher, in general, it has resulted in the gradual reduction in the size of some major rivers and lakes such as Cooum, Adyar, Velachery, Mogappair, Villivakkam and Ambattur.

The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority in its draft on “Second Master Plan for Chennai Metropolitan Area, 2026” (CMDA, 2008) had clearly warned that considering its importance and drainage system it provides, contiguous swamp area in Pallikaranai should remain conserved, prohibiting development therein.

Sadly, Pallikaranai marshland over the years has become the largest dumping site for solid waste. Open spaces and drainage courses have all become the centre of human habitation. In such a case, where will the rain water runoff go? Pathetically, it has to settle instead on the roads causing extensive flood.

The threat of a catastrophic flooding and encroachments on ecologically sensitive wetlands is not happening in Chennai alone. Recent floods in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Guwahati, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Surat clearly demonstrated how most of the urban centres of India fail to manage their drainage channels.

In the process of building a smart city, most of the major cities in India have either completely neglected or have encroached upon the natural reservoirs indiscriminately. As the planet continues to get warmer in the coming decades, countries like India is expected to get more rainfall in less number of rainy days. Are we prepared for it?

As torrential rain continues to batter Chennai, massive water logging in most of the areas clearly indicates that the city has not learned any lessons from 2015. Natural disasters cannot be prevented, but we cannot also sit and wait till the nature unleashes its excess. Better planning is the least that can be done.

A constructive urban planning with proper drainage system is the need of the hour. Governments should not compromise in taking stringent action against encroachments on natural reservoirs, which is reducing water storage capacity.

Tamil Nadu is one among the few states spending large sums of money to clean the rivers and resuscitate the sewage infrastructure. However, all its efforts went in vain primarily because of the civic authorities and land mafia who have been seriously engaged in violating the hydrological cycle of the city. The Standing Committee on Water Resources (2012-13) on “Repair, Renovation and Restoration of Water Bodies”, in its 16th report underlined that most of the water bodies in the country were encroached upon by municipalities and panchayats.

A new legislation should be urgently enacted to make encroachments on water bodies a cognizable offense. In its landmark judgement recently, the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court directed the Government not to grant layout or building plan permission on lands located on water bodies. This is indeed an encouraging signal towards the restoration of dying small water bodies and reducing flood.

With the launch of the massive ‘kudimaramathu’ scheme across the state recently, the policymakers have now realised that the key to resolving both the issues of water shortage and flooding lies in repairing, restoration and renovation of small water bodies which have been largely encroached. Tamil Nadu state can also think of establishing a dedicated Ministry for Water Resources and Flood Governance to improve its governance on water resources and flood on a regular basis.

It is imperative to impose a blanket ban on all construction works in the marshlands. Given the needs, developmental activities in urban areas should be strictly reviewed and approved. Desilting of small water bodies and drainages should be undertaken in regular intervals. The rain water harvesting method that was propagated some years back in the state needs a fresh thrust.

Parks must have ponds and large development areas must have at least a two-acre retention area which will in turn recharge the aquifers. Wherever possible, interlinking of rivers within the state should be encouraged so that the excess of water rather than going waste can be diverted to the water-deficit regions. These initiatives need to be undertaken on a war-footing level. Or else the flood related problems will become a recurring phenomenon.

Click here

The Tamil Nadu government has been quick to use the floods as an excuse to evict the poor from their dwellings on the margins of Chennai’s stinking rivers. But, it has done nothing to check the “mafia.” The largest ongoing conversion of wetlands into real estate in Chennai is happening on the sprawling Ennore Creek to the north of the city.

Going by the popular meaning of mafia as an organised body of criminals, the Ennore Creek encroachers are not strictly mafia. The crime of encroaching, though, is being committed by an organised body of offenders led by state and central Public Sector Units, and facilitated by the very agencies that were set up to protect the environment.

In June 2017, Government of India-owned Kamarajar Port Ltd (KPL) sought and obtained permission from the State Coastal Zone Management Authority to construct car parking terminals, coal yards and free trade warehouse zones by reclaiming several hundred acres of the Ennore Creek. This is in addition to 1,090 acres already diverted illegally to accommodate industrial installations belonging to central PSUs Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum, and a power plant and coal ash dump by NTECL, a centre-state joint venture involving NTPC Ltd and Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO).

KPL’s proposal is pending clearance with the expert appraisal committee of the Union ministry of environment. NTECL’s proposal to further expand its coal ash dump within the creek is pending with the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board. If cleared, the ensuing construction will not only damage the creek irretrievably but also expose 10 lakh people and critical infrastructure, including a petroleum refinery, to disastrous flooding.

Kosasthalaiyar, Chennai’s lesser known river is also its biggest. Kosasthalaiyar exits to sea through the 8,000 acre backwaters of the Ennore Creek. The river’s catchment is four times the combined drainage areas of Adyar and Cooum. Seen solely from a flood mitigation perspective, what Chennai does to the Kosasthalaiyar and the Ennore Creek will decide whether the city will survive or succumb with the next above-average rains.

In his submission to the parliamentary committee, former Union home secretary Rajiv Mehrishi sought to defend the lapses of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in the lead-up to the floods by claiming that it is not possible to prepare for a once-in-a-century disaster. The same was echoed by the then chief minister of Tamil Nadu Ms. Jayalalithaa who declared that “swift rescue and relief alone are indicators of a good government.”

Both responses are intended to normalise a human-made disaster, and gloss over the pathology of urban development under successive administrations. The NDMA has effectively said that it will do nothing – like preventing the encroachment of wetlands by central government-owned entities -- to avert a disaster. In the case of the proposed encroachments by KPL in Ennore Creek, the governments of Tamil Nadu and India have been briefed of the risks and the illegalities.

The chief secretary, the State Disaster Management Authority, the environment secretary have all been approached to direct KPL to build its facilities on dry land instead of the river. None has acted. Worse, the Environment Secretary to the Government of Tamil Nadu actually recommended KPL’s proposal to build inside the Ennore wetlands for clearance. Faced with a dilemma of whether to reduce flood risks for a million people or protect the commercial interests of KPL, the state government has stated its preference clearly.

When the Kosasthalaiyar floods – and flood it will thanks to the encroachments -- and the lives of Chennai residents are imperilled, it should be remembered that those in power at the Centre and the state could have, but did nothing to avert certain disaster. Like the 2015 floods, the next Chennai floods too will be man-made.

299,838,chennai,2017,https://thewire.in/environment/chennai-learn-anything-2015-floods,2 Nov 2017,Did Chennai Learn Anything From the 2015 Floods?,"Indian cities are starting to look boringly similar on the ground. The roads look similar, and so do some of the malls, buildings, apartment complexes and shops. Watching a city while approaching it in an aircraft, train or by road gives a perspective on the landscape on which it is built upon.

Landing at Chennai, one can see many irrigation tanks. These are usually depressions in which a mud or masonry wall has been constructed at the deep end, with a spillway allowing excess water to flow back into the stream. Downstream, not very far from this tank, would be another, for which the inlet stream will be from the outlet of the earlier one. These networks of water bodies are visible when driving into the city from the adjoining Thiruvallur or Chengelput districts.

There were many lakes in Chennai, which have been built over the decades. The four rivers traversing from west to east have had their flood plains constructed over. The Buckingham Canal that runs through the city on a north-south axis has constrictions in its path. The complex of wetlands near the Pallikaranai marsh has disappeared to a significant extent.

Ecological fault lines

The end-2015 flood highlighted these ecological fault lines. The floods hit those areas worst that were once part of the wetland and water body network, such as the southern localities around the Pallikaranai marsh. Even in other localities, those who were not even aware that they were living on former lakebeds, realised the flood water was higher in their homes than in other areas. The flood along the Adayar river spared none in its path, including the super rich, slum dwellers, patients in intensive care units of a hospital, and a housing complex built for senior civil servants.

The city responded in interesting ways. Somewhere, there was an inherent resilience built in, which came into effect during the crisis. A study on Chennai’s resilience prepared by IFMR Lead and TARU Leading Edge for the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network shows that in addition to a response by the fire services, police force and the National Disaster Management Agency, there were many innovative responses.

For instance, the report states that to give food to the stranded, a restaurant called Kolapasi opened its kitchen and delivery systems. At a time 300 volunteers cooked for 170,000 people. Volunteers ranged from university students to businessmen, and even the elderly helped in the kitchen. They used social media to raise funds and identify where to take the food. The report also notes a supermarket chain store that supplied essential commodities at a reduced price to help families recover.

To help families start their kitchens as early as possible, Servals Pvt Ltd, a company that specialises in energy-efficient stoves, supplied their units to families that were outside the government’s distribution networks.

Call a boat

The most innovative move was undertaken by on-demand taxi aggregator, Ola, which turned itself into a call boat aggregator during the flood. They commissioned small fishing boats and vessels to help rescue people and also doubled as a call boat taxi service. The image of fishing boats with Ola stickers became one of the iconic images from the floods. The picture of a well-known industrialist escaping the floods on a fishing boat from his estate on the banks of the Adayar river was another iconic image from the floods.

It was the social and informal media that took centre-stage during the floods. Messages shared on Facebook, Twitter and other sites helped save lives, rescue people and reach food to those stranded. These worked from outside the city and from those localities where power and telephone connectivity returned comparatively quickly.

Bengaluru had become the operations centre for much of this. Arun Ganesh, a digital mapmaker, along with his friend designed a crowd-sourced map where residents could feed information on how deep water was at any point on any street. This was launched on December 1, 2015, and was immediately picked up by Chennai residents. At any given time during the floods there were at least 100 people accessing it. Flooding was reported from 15,000 road segments and in the two weeks of its launch it had registered 1.2 million views.

People from Chennai working outside the state wanted to pitch in. A group of Indian Administrative Service officers from Tamil Nadu working in other states got together and started a call centre in Bengaluru. It was established at the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board office by the then managing director P. Manivannan. Helping him to work at the call centre were young professionals from Chennai working in Bengaluru. They knew the geography of Chennai, and were well placed to receive distress calls and direct relief.

Weather watcher

Pradeep John, an amateur weather watcher, found great traction for his Facebook posts and tweets. He had practical advice on when the next spell of rain was coming, how intense it would be and how long it would last. John became an overnight celebrity, and his postings under the name of Tamil Nadu Weatherman has an increasing number of followers ever since.

Radio jockey Balaji, actor Siddharth and singer Chinmayi formed another group that aggregated calls for help through social media and directed help to where it was needed. The social media momentum continued when the city faced other extreme weather events such as Cyclone Vardah and the drought of summer 2017. It was also used as the youth of Tamil Nadu congregated at the Marina Beach to protest against the ban on traditional bull racing, or jallikattu.

Did Chennai learn from the crisis and take steps to deal with future events? Although the rains were not as severe as that during end-2015, exactly a year later when Cyclone Vardah struck, municipal authorities were quicker with their response. With gale winds reaching 140 km per hour, Vardah brought down nearly 20,000 trees in the city. The corporation could clear these trees off the roads in the next few days. Also, power, phone and Internet connectivity were restored faster.

Stop the mafia

But this still does not mean that the city will not flood during the next rains. A Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Chennai floods notes in its August 12, 2016, report that the encroachment of lakes and river beds played a major role in causing the floods. “The Committee feels that the State Government should check the mafia involved in illegal construction for business and usurping water bodies for their real estate business. The flood channels and riverbed should be cleared as soon as possible by removing illegal/unauthorized constructions.”

Obviously, this has not happened. The river channels have been dredged and widened in some places, but the river mouths (including the mouth of Pallikaranai marsh at Muthukadu) continue to be blocked by sand bars.

The government authorities had argued before the committee that since the end-2015 flood was a one-in-a-hundred-year event, it would be impossible to prevent the damages. The parliamentarians found this unacceptable. “The Committee does not quite accept the argument that since the rainfall was unprecedented and was more than the hundred years average therefore the damage was also huge.”

The citizens of Chennai are scared because rain events of even lesser intensity have been causing waterlogging and floods in the past few years. The further the city moves from the original landscape on which it was built, greater is the risk of floods.

A bustling metropolitan that is home to more than 7 million people, it faces water shortages year after year. However, in November 2015, a cyclonic weather cycle began to affect the state, with the city receiving 1,049 mm (41.3 in) of rain in that month alone, the highest since November 1918, when 1,088 mm (42.8 in) of rainfall had been recorded. The Chennai International Airport recorded 266 mm of rainfall in 24 hours on 15 November. By 17 November, much of the city had flooded, even though the rains had stopped.

The rains brought Chennai to a standstill. Schools, colleges and offices were closed for the most part, while lakes that had been absolutely dry for more than two decades breached their banks, leading to submerging surrounding areas. Water rose up to the second floor in some localities, with intermittent power cuts and limited mobile connectivity across the city.

And then came the 1 December deluge. On that fateful day, in just a span of 12 hours, Chennai received a record- breaking 272 mm of rainfall. By 8 December, Chennai had recorded 539 mm of rain, as opposed to the monthly average of 191 mm. The incessant rain put pressure on the already overburdened drains and, by the afternoon of 1 December, power supplies had been suspended to 60 per cent, while several city hospitals had stopped functioning. For the first time since its inception in 1878, The Hindu did not publish a print edition on 2 December as workers were unable to reach the press. The Southern Railways cancelled all major train services and the Chennai International Airport was closed until 6 December. Chennai was officially declared a disaster area on the evening of 2 December.

It was in this crisis that individuals mobilised on social media like never before.

Mobile connectivity was not as damaged as other information services, and social media, accessed on smartphones, became the number one source of information during the crisis. Having a fully charged mobile phone became such a critical asset that, along with food, water and other relief materials, power banks were distributed to allow people to charge their phones.

Several emergency numbers had been set up, but getting through to those numbers was difficult. The veracity of the numbers also became an issue. As a result, Twitter and Facebook became the “go-to” places for everything related to rescue efforts, from keeping track of the worst-affected areas and their requirements, to putting out SOS calls or volunteering for help.

Facebook activated its “safety check” feature – which allowed users to mark themselves as “safe” on their profile during a crisis – while several Facebook groups like Chennai Rain Relief provided basic tips on how to rescue people and lists of dos and don’ts, apart from coordinating rescue efforts. Facebook also became a hub for those who were trying to contact their families.

One ingenious resource that was circulated widely during the floods was a crowdsourced effort that mapped inundated roads in the city. Over 2,500 flooded roads were added to the city’s map via social media, which was put together by engineer and information designer, Arun Ganesh.

The Chennai floods were a superb example of the power of collective effort. Users across social media channels came together to offer shelter, food, transport, and even a place for people to charge their phones. SOS messages asking ground teams to rescue stranded family members also went back and forth, and there were many who offered their homes and offices to those who were stranded.

Perhaps the most simple yet effective tool during the floods was the website chennairains.org.

It began as a simple Google spreadsheet. Sowmya Rao was trying to help her uncle and aunt figure out whether it was safe to stay in their house in suburban Chennai or move to a friend’s place. When she found out that the area they lived in was under severe risk of flooding, she relayed the message to them. But she felt helpless about the countless others who were facing the same plight as her relatives. Acting on a suggestion by another Twitter user, she created the Google spreadsheet that went on to become the website chennairains.org.

The idea was simple: crowdsource details about those who could offer shelter, and pass it on to those who were tweeting about rising waters. A hastily put-together spreadsheet soon blossomed into a multi-faceted, volunteer-driven, highly energetic online movement to help Chennai, and ended up being used by the general public, police officers, government officials and celebrities alike.

Rao later wrote in a blog on Twitter India that the entire operation was run “almost exclusively on Twitter”.

To segregate pleas for help from updates on rain and volunteering efforts, users attributed tweets to one of the three hashtags: #ChennaiRainsHelp, #ChennaiRescue, and #ChennaiVolunteer to systematically organise all incoming tweets. Twitter was also active in ensuring that this information reached as many people as possible by promoting it on its official India page.

Karthik Balakrishnan, the web developer behind chennairains.org, told an English daily that he got the idea to make the website after he privately messaged Sandhya Ramesh, another Twitter user who was actively coordinating relief efforts on Twitter at the time. She, in turn, linked him to Sowmya Rao’s Google spreadsheet. Balakrishnan and Rao discussed turning the spreadsheet into a website at 2 am on 2 December, following which Balakrishnan booked the domain and posted the site by 3.30 am.

Raheel Khursheed, head of news, politics and government, Twitter India and South East Asia, says, “Twitter is the first port of call for people responding to a disaster as we’re a live, real-time public platform. The advantages are manifold. You can have conversations around organising relief at scale, you can form groups quickly, you can group DM with 10 or 15 people and start a conversation around coordinating relief efforts.”

Twitter tied up with all the volunteer groups who were working together on the #ChennaiRainsHelp campaign ­ including InCrisisRelief, The News Minute, Airtel, Zomato, Goonj, Bhumi, Uday Foundation and Practo – with data support from Delhi-based SocialCops. “The partners we were working with were responding to the disaster in their own way, so we thought it may be a good idea to just get everyone onto the same page, and help them with data,” Khursheed says.

By 5 December, the chennairains.org team began facing a new issue. They had data from the beginning of the floods, but did not know how many of those who had requested help still needed it. With Exotel, a cloud telephony provider, chennairains.org developed an SMS system which sent out messages to the listed numbers. Balakrishnan told a website, “The SMS basically said you have three numbers here. If you still needed help with food and aid, please give a missed call on one number. If you were safe, give a missed call on another number, and if you were in urgent need of help, a third number was given. All this data was tied into our database, and we coordinated people to drive relief efforts accordingly.”

A volunteer team of at least 50-60 people kept track of everything online, manually matching relief efforts on a rotation basis 24 hours a day.

It required knowledge of the city and the language: Tamil. Getting a location from a plain text address to marking it on Google Maps also required manual effort.

“For about 75 to 80 percent of the areas, the team was able to get the latitude-longitude coordinates on a map by searching on Google’s Location API. For the [remaining] 20 percent, where the landmarks were vague, the team coordinated over phone calls. On average, each person of the now 200-member team made about 200 to 250 phone calls over a period of four days. The phone calls were made to coordinate with people on the ground, to verify and find out if people had gotten any assistance,” Balakrishnan said.

Rao says in her blog post, “In less than 7 days, the crowd- sourcing effort taught many of us the importance of efficient coordination as well as [the] veracity and authenticity of data. The biggest advantage of using Twitter and other online media here was real-time data relaying. People on the ground got to know updates from other areas almost instantaneously thanks to tweets. This enabled efficient volunteer coordination, not only on the field, but also with outstation supplies and distribution. This was a great demonstration of how information is truly powerful.”

The extreme El Nino conditions in 2015 and the warming trend in the Bay of Bengal contributed equally to the unprecedented heavy rainfall witnessed in Chennai for three days from November 30 to December 2, 2015, researchers have found.

El Nino generally causes less than normal rainfall in the case of the southwest monsoon. In contrast, it brings about above-normal rainfall during the northeast monsoon. This is because of the difference in seasonal wind patterns between the two monsoons.

A study by the University of Hyderabad and the Indian Institute of Technology – Bombay suggests that the extreme El Nino that occurred in 2015 played an important role in Chennai’s heavy rainfall. After 1982 and 1997, the 2015 event also turned out to be an extreme El Nino event.

“Another factor that seems to have played an important role is the consistent warming of the Bay of Bengal off the coast of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh,” says Dr. Karumuri Ashok from the Centre for Earth and Space Sciences, University of Hyderabad, and the corresponding author of the paper published in the journal Climate Dynamics .

Linear correlation

A simple linear correlation analysis carried out by the authors indicates that the Bay of Bengal sea surface temperature positively and significantly correlated with northeast monsoon rainfall.

The magnitude of correlations of northeast monsoon rainfall with El Nino conditions and the Bay of Bengal warming are nearly similar.

“Based on sensitivity experiments we could conjuncture that about 21% of the intensity of the extreme Chennai rainfall can be attributed to the extreme El Nino conditions,” Dr. Ashok says. “Interestingly, the warming trend in the Bay of Bengal [sea surface temperature] contributed equally to the Chennai event.”

El Nino can affect the Indian monsoon through atmospheric circulation. Whenever the El Nino signal shows up in atmospheric circulation, the local sea surface temperature can also change.

“Experiments suggest that changes in local sea surface temperature seem to be stronger than local atmospheric changes,” Dr. Ashok says. He however cautions that these results have been arrived using just one dynamical model. “We need to confirm if this result is correct. So we need to repeat using more cases with the same model and similar type of studies using other numerical models,” he says.

It remains to be seen if this kind of contribution from the tropical Pacific to extreme rainfall during the northeast monsoon happens only during extreme El Nino or whether normal El Ninos too can cause it.

“This is important because the El Nino itself is changing,” Dr. Ashok says.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Splurge and save now! Click here

This isn’t the first time life in Mumbai, or a sprawling urban landscape, has ground to a halt due to floods. The American state of Texas is currently flooded, in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey that hit Houston on Friday.

While the underlying cause of the flooding may be different, the factors exacerbating these disasters are similar, say experts. The tale is the same everywhere: unplanned construction, deforestation, insufficient drainage system and poor disaster response are the major culprits.

Here are five times India’s cities found themselves facing floods after a heavy deluge:

Mumbai, 2005

Mumbai is no stranger to floods. It suffers almost every other year when there is a downpour. But twelve years ago, Mumbai drowned in 944mm of rain and over 500 people died. Mumbai’s civic infrastructure crumbled under the onslaught of rain and the city was flooded, with residents wading in chest-high water. Airports were shut for 30 hours, trains were cancelled, the Mumbai-Pune Expressway was shut down and mobile networks were hit. Stranded residents sought shelter in colleges, offices and even in the homes of strangers.

The deluge is referred to ever since simply as ‘26/7’ in the manner of a terrorist attack.

Srinagar, 2014

In September 2014, Jammu and Kashmir’s worst floods in 60 years killed more than 200 and displaced almost a million for weeks. Major parts of the Srinagar city, including the Lal Chowk, army cantonment and Civil Lines areas were submerged. Thousands were evacuated by the army and rescue forces but many were stranded on the upper stories of their houses. All the vital roads were submerged and there was waterlogging even in the civil secretariat and Jammu and Kashmir high court. Hospitals were badly affected too.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took office that year, took an aerial survey of the flood situation and later announced a special package for the state.

Chennai, 2015

A mix of flood waters and neck-deep sewage swelled in Chennai after weeks of monsoon rains resulted in a cloudburst in November-December 2015. The floods claimed the lives of 270 in one of India’s most populous cities.

As images emerged showing people being rescued through boats, the sight of three dozen airliners with their undercarriages covered by flood waters at the Chennai international airport made people wonder if it was built in the wrong place. Mobile network and landlines too were knocked out in most of the city.

While Chennai was not unique, experts said it was worse hit than the rest of India’s southeastern seaboard because of the development boom that has gone unchecked, including rampant illegal construction.

Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, 2017

Heavy overnight rains pounded Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar in Gujarat, throwing life out of gear in July. The death toll touched at least 129 in the state devastated by heavy flooding since the monsoon rains began a month ago. Both cities recorded 7 and 8 inches of rainfall over the night, leaving public transport crippled due to waterlogged roads.

An amateur meteorologist who developed considerable expertise in weather data and satellite imagery, John’s online followers relied on his crisp forecasts and advice.

“Do not step out unless really necessary,” he wrote in one typical note. “Keep your phones charged, this seems to be a long spell,” he said in another.

The 34-year-old weatherman, though, did not fully appreciate how popular his reports were until November 15, 2015, during the third of what would ultimately be five spells of torrential rain that killed more than 400 residents and brought Chennai to a standstill for weeks. John received a message that day on WhatsApp about an expert who predicted more rain and realized with a shock that the post was referencing him. Web traffic monitors indicated that 250,000 people in and around flooded Chennai were following his posts.

“My messages helped people to take immediate decisions,” said John in an interview. “I could tell them which parts of the city would get rain, how long it would last, and how intense it would be.”

A Citizen-Driven Movement

John is part of a growing community of savvy young professionals that has helped spur much of Chennai’s rapid development as a center of information and manufacturing technology. But popular online forums in Chennai are also helping residents understand how competing trends in hydrology, weather, land use, and development are putting the metropolitan region’s 10 million residents – and many of its businesses – at risk. In guiding residents through the complexities of ecology and urban design, web activists and entrepreneurs are a pushing city authorities to update Chennai’s growth-at-any-cost development strategy.

John’s work, for instance, bridges the gap between the daily and weekly forecasts of the India Meteorological Department, published on its website, and the real-time information needs of those living in Chennai’s most flood-prone neighborhoods.

Another group, Citizens Platform, has turned to mapping development patterns around the city’s lakes to deepen understanding of flood-related disasters. The intent is to improve public knowledge about how construction patterns affect drainage.

A third group, led by Arun Ganesh, a 29-year-old digital mapmaker, developed a street-level map of Chennai that incorporates crowd-sourced information about what roads are inundated, by how much, and where to find relief camps. The map went live on December 1, 2015. Not only were residents able to avoid the most dangerous flood zones, the city learned which areas were the first to flood and to what depth.

“It was the first time a street-level disaster mapping exercise was being carried out,” said Ganesh. “Our map was immediately picked up by Chennai residents and at any given time during the floods there were at least 100 people accessing it. Flooding was reported from 15,000 road segments, and in the two weeks of its launch it had registered 1.2 million views.”

In displaying command of data gathering and forecasting, these and other projects have put residents and city leaders on notice that Chennai’s rambunctious development, which has spread across the city’s table-flat geography and consumed much of its water-absorbing marshes and natural areas, has become particularly vulnerable to dangerous new climate conditions. Even in a 400-year-old coastal city accustomed to periodic cyclones, wet winters, and dry summers, severe weather is pushing the city to embrace new designs for growth that are safer.

In the Path of Peril

Located on the eastern seaboard of the Indian peninsula, facing the Bay of Bengal, Chennai is in the direct path of weather events that are increasing in intensity, according to regional modeling studies carried out for the Tamil Nadu State Action Plan on Climate Change. The plan projects that the average annual maximum temperature for Tamil Nadu could increase by 3.1 degrees Celsius (five degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100 compared to the 1970-2000 baseline. Average annual rainfall, on the other hand, could decline by up to nine percent. Rainfall patterns could also shift, bringing more intense cyclones and floods, followed by long periods of drought.

The city, as currently laid out, is ill-prepared for such dramatic changes. The 2015 floods and the 2016/2017 drought have proved that point.

There was nowhere for the water to flow but into buildings, homes, and the streets

The long period of dry weather over the last year has cut water levels in the four reservoirs that serve Chennai – Poondi, Cholavaram, Red Hills, and Chembarambakkam – by alarming amounts. As of this writing, they hold a mere 11 percent of their capacity, and the city utility, Chennai Metro Water, is able to supply less than half of its typical 1.1 million-cubic meter daily flow to residents and businesses.

Damage from the flooding is worse. The last major flood in Chennai before 2015 was in 2005. In the decade between the two events, Chennai changed markedly. The city’s economic growth engine ran in overdrive and the metro region swelled by roughly 250,000 people a year. Entire new sections of the city appeared, including the IT corridor in the city’s southern district, replaced water-absorbing marshland and natural areas with pavement and buildings. Large parts of Pallikaranai Marsh, the city’s largest wetland, were filled in with unplanned construction. The Old Mahabalipuram Road, linking Chennai to the historic town of Mahabalipuram, was reclaimed from the adjoining wetlands and turned into an expressway. More office buildings rose along the corridor.

New residents, middle class and poor, crowded into the floodplains of the three rivers that flow from west to east through the city – the Kosasthalaiyar, Cooum, and Adyar. Overburdened sewage treatment plants poured raw wastes into the rivers, filling them with sludge that reduced their drainage capacity. The city’s old and inadequate storm drainage networks overflowed during even modest downpours.

When five heavy rainfall events happened between November 8 and December 5, 2015, there was nowhere for the water to flow but into buildings, homes, and the streets. Floodwaters at the city’s international airport were so deep that small planes floated away.

A New Operating Strategy

Chennai city authorities have long been aware of the increasing menace that the disruptive 21st-century climate poses for the area. For years they have held periodic public forums and meetings with academic experts to consider ideas to guide development.

To better manage minor flooding, Chennai is adding modern storm-water drains to its urban drainage network, for example – though the work is expensive and slow.

City leaders have also embraced desalination to help solve the water scarcity dilemma. Chennai has two operating desalination plants capable of producing about 200,000 cubic meters (52.8 million gallons) of freshwater per day. A third could be completed by 2020 and a fourth is planned.

In order to reduce demand on freshwater, two sewage treatment plants will soon start tertiary treatment and convert 45 million liters of wastewater a day (11.8 million gallons) to water usable for industry. A large program to replace conventional street and traffic lighting with high-efficiency LEDs, meanwhile, is intended to reduce demand from water-intensive coal-fired power plants.

Chennai has also developed a rainwater collection and storage program and encouraged water-conserving techniques in construction and manufacturing.

Choices that residents are making about where to live, such as in neighborhoods less prone to severe flooding, are aided by construction of a new subway system that opened in 2015. New lines are being added and the $2.25 billion system is expected to have 45 kilometers of tracks (28 miles) and 32 stations when completed in 2018.

“Civil Society Had to Move In”

But city leaders are less enthusiastic about taming Chennai’s sprawl, which is paving over more and more ground. Residents said in interviews that it still only takes a moderate rain to cause storm drains to overflow across much of the city. Persistent flooding and associates losses could cause the city to lose its reputation as one of Asia’s best places to live and do business.

That’s where Pradeep John and other young professionals come in. Their work is helping to elevate the urgency of Chennai’s water-logged condition.

The breakthrough was that social media became a tool for conveying reliable information

Arun Ganesh was surprised and thrilled by how online viewers responded to his flood maps in 2015, and the website continues to give the city vital data about where its flood prevention efforts need to improve.

“The breakthrough during the 2015 floods was that social media became a tool for conveying reliable information,” said Divya Ganeshan, a 29-year-old city resident who teamed up with her friends to establish a community kitchen for stranded people. Their effort was strengthened by a group of Tamils working in Bengaluru, the capital of neighboring Karnataka, where a call center coordinated relief programs.

John, Ganesh, Ganeshan, and others proved so effective at setting up informal networks that government officials took notice. The Bengaluru call center informally blended the efforts of government officials with citizen volunteers. P. Manivannan, an administrative service officer who was then the managing director of the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board, coordinated the joint efforts. “By using the expertise with the government and the volunteers, we could force-multiply the communication and support network with Chennai,” he said.

“The intensity of the 2015 flood and the enormity of efforts that were needed to deal with it brought the citizens out to innovate and find new ways to communicate and support,” said Vaishnavi Jayakumar, co-founder of The Banyan, a non-government organization that works with the mentally ill in Chennai. “We have always been used to the government being in charge and the civil society helping out. In 2015, we realized the government just cannot reach everywhere and the civil society had to move in.”",flood,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, India","November 8, 2015","December 5, 2015",Chennai metropolitan region,430 mm (17 in),$10 billion,400,severe,"The floods were caused by five heavy rainfall events that happened between November 8 and December 5, 2015.

On October 30, the North East monsoon hit Tamil Nadu with a bang. Schools were shut for most of last week, and the state government issued a notice asking private companies to allow their employees to work from home.

On November 2, after six hours of incessant rainfall, several areas in southern and western Chennai were waterlogged. Fearing a repeat of the 2015 floods, more than 10,000 residents of low-lying areas took shelter in 114 relief centres in Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Nagapattinam, the Tamil Nadu government said.

Despite the efforts of Chennai authorities to prepare for the monsoon by desilting rivers and building storm water drains, many low-lying residential areas find themselves under a few feet of water ever year.

The reason is simple. Most of these low-lying residential areas were once lakes.

A comparison of the 1909 map of Madras, the 1970 Survey of India map and a contemporary Google map shows how the city’s lakes have disappeared over the past century.

The Long Tank

Today, there is no trace of the large water body marked on the map as the Long Tank. Over the past hundred years, densely populated neighbourhoods have been built on this lake, including Thyagaraya Nagar – known for its jewellery and sari shops. These areas now constitute central Chennai.

The erstwhile Vyasarpadi tank in northern Chennai now houses the Dr Ambedkar Government Arts College, as well as the homes of the poor in BV Colony and Saliman Colony. Traces of the tank can be seen in the Survey of India map of 1971. But in the present day map on Google Earth, the Vyasarpadi tank has entirely disappeared.

Velachery Lake and Adambakkam Lake

Parts of Velachery and surrounding areas were inundated by several feet of water during the floods of 2015. The neighbourhood continues to face water-logging and traffic jams every year, including this monsoon. A glance at the Survey of India map of 1970 shows that this is hardly surprising. Today, only a sliver of the lake still exists. The two Adambakkam lakes are not evident any longer.

Climate resilience in Chennai’s neighbourhoods depends not only on their land use and hydrology, but also on the social and economic abilities of residents, and their capacity to improvise systems to overcome a crisis

When Chennai flooded in end-2015, newly developed areas such as Velachery flooded more than older parts of the city such as Mylapore. That was natural, since Velachery is among the localities that developed after the late 1990s in the southern axis radiating out of the city. It was built over a complex of low-lying wetlands, and water flowed and accumulated there.

Since the water stayed in these areas for a long time, the physical impact of the flood was higher in these areas. Water drained out of Mylapore faster. Despite that, in terms of social and economic dimensions of the recovery, Velachery was not far behind Mylapore. A team of researchers from the School of Earth and Atmospheric Science, Madras University, and ETH Zurich in Switzerland came to this conclusion after surveying residents of Mylapore and Velachery in recent months.

Extreme rain events (EREs) affect different parts of the city differently based on land use patterns and hydrology. However, how the localities respond and recover depends on their social and economic abilities and how they improvise systems to get on top of the crisis. Together, these constitute the climate resilience of different localities. With EREs likely to become more frequent in future, and understanding on how localities coped in the past will help design interventions for the future. See: Extreme rainfall leaves cities floundering, Encroached wetlands, cut trees increase climate risks in Chennai

In the process of getting back to their feet, the residents of Velachery, predominantly working at information technology companies, whose offices dot the Old Mahabailuparam Road and the radial roads emanating from it, were found to be quicker. Their counterparts in Mylapore, which is one of the oldest parts of Chennai, with its maze of small streets surrounding centuries-old temples, were slower in their recovery response. If there was a delay in recovery in Velachery, it was because of the higher intensity impact that the locality had suffered.

How neighbourhoods responded

“After the 2015 flood, we wanted to check how two different parts of the city responded to situation,” said R.R. Krishnamurthy, head, Department of Applied Geology, University of Madras. Krishnamurthy’s team collaborated with researchers from ETH Zurich to study the comparative resilience of the two localities.

“Though Velachery was hit worse than Mylapore, the people improvised, created teams and institutions, and worked better at recovery compared to the people of the established locality of Mylapore,” Krishnamurthy told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “This included innovative improvisation such as adding height to their existing buildings by cutting and adding height to its walls.” In an already sunken Velachery, repeated road repairs had let to the roads increasing in height, and thereby trapping water within households. See: Lifting houses to escape Chennai floods

According to Jonas Joerin of the Department of Environmental Systems Science, ETH Zurich, the study’s objective was to look at the relative response through three different dimensions — physical, social and economic.

“Our key finding is that for physical items such as electricity, roads, connectivity, water supply, etc., Velachery took more time for recovery,” Joerin told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “This is not surprising since the damage was high and obviously it will take more time to recover. But when we looked at the social and economic assets such as education, food, nutrition, income generation or household assets, we see a much less time gap between the two constituencies. So, whether you lived in Mylapore or Velachery, you needed the same time to recover from the socio-economic aspects.”

People’s participation

In Velachery, people were more eager to be part of the recovery process. They became active members of the teams involved with the recovery process, and offered more help to the neighbours. “We realised that higher the flood impact higher was the people’s involvement in recovery,” Joerin said.

Questions on satisfaction with the recovery process showed that even though it took longer for Velachery to recover because of the damage, it was not as if the people were less satisfied. “Apparently the flood intensity did not have a significant impact on people’s satisfaction levels,” Joerin commented.

The study also confirmed what was known anecdotally since the flood — the elected representatives were not very effective interacting with the people during the floods. Ironically, this did not affect the voting pattern in the 2016 Tamil Nadu Assembly elections, where the ruling party retained their constituencies in some of the badly affected areas of the city.

“This study will help us be better prepared for events such as the 2015 flood,” R. Nataraj, Member of Legislative Assembly from Mylapore, told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “For this we have to involve everybody including the public and voluntary organisations. People should be prepared but not scared of rains.”

Increased vulnerability in Chennai

Being a flat city that has been losing its wetlands to construction and with development along the floodplains constricting the flow of the rivers, Chennai has been prone to waterlogging and floods. Between November 8 and December 4, 2015, there were five EREs in Chennai, which brought severe floods and also a fear into people’s minds.

The biggest blow to Chennai’s resilience was the drowning of the city’s airport in floodwater from the Adayar River. This effectively disabled what could have been the most important point for receiving relief supplies and evacuating people from the city. The flooding of the airport happened since the secondary runway was constructed over the river, and at this point the water rose into the airport compound.

With inadequate involvement of the elected representatives during the 2015 floods, the citizens improvised and developed innovative communication channels based on social and other media. These helped to give information to those stranded and reach help and support to them. Chennai citizens later used some of these innovative communication methods during Cyclone Varadah in December 2016 and the summer drought of 2017.

Perhaps it is this emphasis on innovative communication that gave the edge to Velachery citizens in their recovery process over those in the older locality of Mylapore.

The situation is a far cry from 2015 when what was called the heaviest rainfall in 100 years left this neighbourhood built on a lake bed under several feet of water for days. More than 300 flood-related deaths were reported across Tamil Nadu during the October-December Northeast Monsoon that year. In Chennai, the flooding was largely blamed on poorly constructed and ill-maintained drains and illegal construction on water bodies.

The reason why Sidco Nagar and many other residential areas in Chennai have managed to avoid waterlogging despite heavy rain all through last week is because the residents, through their persistence, got the municipal corporation to clean and expand stormwater drains in their areas.

Babu, the 70-year-old general secretary of the Sidco Nagar Residents Welfare Association, said maintenance work on stormwater drains in his neighbourhood started a few months ago. The existing drains were widened to five feet in height and depth, and links were constructed where breakages were found.

The measures proved effective and there has been no waterlogging in Sidco Nagar so far. The rainwater is flowing smoothly into the nearby Otteri Nala, which is linked to the Buckingham canal, which in turn drains into the sea.

“I have written letters to many corporation officials thanking them for their cooperation in getting the stormwater drains cleared,” said Babu. “Nobody has complained to me about flooding in the area this time.”

Working drains

After the 2015 floods, the Chennai Corporation was soundly criticised for lack of maintenance of the city’s canal systems and drainage networks. A report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, tabled in the Assembly in July 2016, further stated that the city’s stormwater drains suffered from faulty construction and lack of planning.

In August last year, Scroll.in spoke to Babu Rajendran, who was then the chief engineer of special projects in the Chennai Corporation, and he said the civic body had identified vulnerable spots where stormwater drains had collapsed. “We are going to construct links here,” he said.

An emailed query to the corporation on Wednesday for an update on its flood-preparedness did not elicit a response till the time this report was published.

Last week, a report in The Hindu said a delay in the release of funds to create a network of drains and canals along two river basins had left Chennai largely unprepared for the monsoon.

This seemed to be the case as the city promptly flooded when the rains came on November 2. This gave rise to allegations of government inaction and fears of a repeat of the 2015 disaster.

But the positive results of citizens’ efforts in Sidco Nagar and several other areas have assuaged some of these fears. Take the case of Thoraipakkam. Located along the Pallikaranai marshland in South Chennai, this neighbourhood was severely waterlogged in 2015 because its drainage network, which is connected to the Okkiyam Madivu water channel, was clogged with debris.

All this debris was removed in the past few months. “There was smooth flow [of water] this time,” said resident Kalyan Arun. “The corporation officials have been cooperative. We kept putting pressure on them and meeting with them quite often before the onset of the monsoon.”

In some neighbourhoods like Nerkundram in Northwest Chennai, dry streets are a new phenomenon. The corporation interlinked stormwater drains here and there has been no stagnation of water on the roads ever since, reported The New Indian Express. “Over 130 km of stormwater drains have been constructed in zone 11 since the Chennai floods of 2015 under which Nerkundram comes,” the report quoted zonal officer Vijayakumar as saying.

Many areas still ignored

However, many other parts of the city, especially in the southwest, remain under water a week after the downpour started.

The neighbourhoods of Keelkatalai, Sunnambu Kolathur and Narayanapuram are situated between small lakes and separated from each other by elevated roads. With no way for the water to flow out into the nearby marshes, these residential areas face flooding every year.

After the 2015 floods, the S Kolathur Residents Welfare Association had petitioned both the Public Works Department and the chief minister’s office for a network of stormwater drains to be built in the area. “In 2015, they said they will make a concrete canal for the water to flow out,” said Sajid, secretary of the association. “But nothing has been done yet. Even now, they do not have a detailed project report.”

Government officials and ministers finally visited the locality a week after the rains, Sajid said. He added that the neighbourhood only managed to get the attention of the government and the media “since there has not been much flooding in other areas this year”.

Stormwater drains not the solution

However, experts point out that stormwater drains should not be the final stop in how Chennai tackles flooding and erratic weather. Satyarupa Shekhar of the non-profit Citizen Consumer and Civic Action Group said these drains merely carry the water out to the sea, and it would be more effective to use the rainwater to recharge the groundwater – the levels of which have fallen drastically in recent years.

Shekhar also said such a policy would work better at a time when weather patterns like short bursts of rains and unreliable monsoons have become frequent. “Stormwater drains are inappropriate for a city like Chennai,” she said. “What we need is more water conservation and resilient infrastructure. Unless we do both, we will experience both floods and droughts.”",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

The project is being implemented under the supervision of a high-powered committee led by former Secretary of Ministry of Earth Sciences, Shailesh Nayak. The initiative was taken by Office of Principal Scientific Advisor after the devastating floods the city experienced in 2015.

Speaking to India Science Wire here, Dr Nayak said the work was progressing well and the system is expected to go on steam by February next year. The system would keep track of heavy rain events and come out with forecasts taking into account all parameters, including tide heights in the Bay of Bengal and water levels in reservoirs feeding the city as well as in Adyar and Cooum rivers that run through it.

All institutions relevant for proper functioning of the system have been involved in this exercise. These include the India Meteorological Department, the National Central for Medium Range Weather Forecast, Central Water Commission and the National Disaster Management Authority at the national level to Tamil Nadu Government’s Irrigation Department. In addition, academic institutions have also been roped in.

The IITs in Mumbai and Chennai are designing and developing the system. It would be managed by the Chennai-based Integrated Coastal and Marine Area Management (ICMAM) project under the Ministry of Earth Sciences.“Information about rainfall, tides, reservoir and river levels and other parameters will flow from IMD and other agencies into ICMAM. It will analyse the data and disseminate the forecasts to NDMA, State Government and other stakeholders,” Dr Nayak added.

Reports aout Cyclone Ockhi are pouring in. The severe storm has claimed at least 16 people in South Tamil Nadu and Kerala as of December 1. Another potential cyclone formation is gathering momentum near the Andamans, which may reach Indian East Coast on late Monday. The beginning of December, unwillingly, brings the traumatic memory of 2015 floods, followed by the 2016 cyclone in Tamil Nadu, especially in Chennai. However, after 12 years of national Disaster Management Act (2005) and two consecutive disasters wreaked havoc, Chennai, at last, gets its own disaster management plan. The plan has swiftly been posted in the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) website without much noise at the beginning of northeast monsoon here (between last week of October and first week of November). Better late than never.

City Disaster Management Plan not a comprehensive document

The plan is the right step by the GCC to dispel much criticism of its inability to manage disasters or make Chennai ‘truly disaster-resilient’. The City Disaster Management Plan-2017 (CDMP), prepared by the GCC, is a logical first step to build the confidence among citizens to establish preparedness of the city administration for disasters. However, the availability of the plan only in English and not in Tamil language has defeated the very purpose of making it. Despite both rich and poor being affected in December deluge two years ago, the GCC seems to cater to the minuscule section of society in Chennai who had been cosmetically vocal against GCC.

Two years down the memory lane, it is apt to say that not all citizens have the ability or capacity to be resilient to disasters-both natural and man-made.

The CDMP will be reviewed annually based on the requirement and past experience. The 103-page document can’t be called concise but it is not comprehensive as well. At the outset, the plan welcomes feedback and suggestions to strengthen GCC’S effort to make Chennai ‘a safe place to live in’. In fact, there are number of areas within the CDMP which need continuous improvement to make the plan comprehensive.

Only publishing the English version of the plan online doesn’t build the capacity of citizens to manage disaster risks. The immediate step of GCC is to translate it into Tamil language and host it in a dedicated page in its website, not under ‘North East Monsoon 2017’ section, as it is presently showing.

More needs to be done

Ensure the CDMP document must be available and easily accessible at every educational institution, both government and private offices and public places in both English and Tamil. Further, the GCC can facilitate frequent awareness and targeted orientation programmes in a manner and language which is understandable to most vulnerable population of the city. If GCC has limited human resources as it has always been explaining during emergency situations, it may take help of dedicated NGOs/experts to build the capacity of residents.

The GCC needs to popularise the concepts related to disasters both natural and man-made through pictures, drawings and murals in public places. Hopefully, GCC-administered schools and colleges will include disaster risk management in their syllabi.

Role of citizens not considered

Arguably, the present CDMP, which is focused on guidelines of disaster management for its own administration units, mostly during the northeast monsoon period, has completely left out in its ‘mission’ and vision, the role of citizens and their participation or building their capacity for resilient future.

While the CDMP claims to incorporate several guidelines of Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030)—the-UN sponsored global agreement on disaster—the plan is mute on societal resilience as prescribed by the Sendai Framework: a) dissemination of disaster risk information to general public and communities at risk of exposure to disaster; and b) to build the knowledge of government officials at all levels, civil society, communities and volunteers.

In fact, the Hyogo Framework of Action (2005-2015)—predecessor of Sendai Framework—was anchored in building the resilience of nations and communities to disasters, which is not factored into the CDMP.

Most of the global agreements from climate change to sustainable habitat, including Sendai Framework and Hyogo Framework of Action, have concluded that effective integration of disaster risk reduction (DRR) into development policies, planning and programing would immensely minimise the impacts of disasters. The CDMP advocates that DRR concerns are being integrated into the plan, but this integration is not clear in the plan.

Following the ‘improvement works done after 2015 flood’ as posted by the GCC in Tamil language under the same section of North East Monsoon 2017, mostly the work done were constructing storm water drainages, flood protection walls and desilting canals. Were the concerns of disaster risk reduction or climate change considered in these activities? The early November rain this month had already put to test the claims of the CDMP. Many parts of Chennai were waterlogged and roads were submerged for weeks.

Further, the CDMP elaborates on cyclone, flood, tsunami and earthquake as major disasters but silent on heat wave and sea level rise. As the draft Tamil Nadu State Action Plan on Climate Change (2014) talks about sea level rise, the CDMP may find it apt to include its preparedness for sea level rise, as well as heat wave. At present, the state government is preparing a draft Coastal Regulation Act. The CDMP may be strongly considered in drafting this important legislation, which has been pending since 2011. Similarly, the Second Master Plan for Chennai needs to be reviewed in the light of CDMP.

Now that the Plan is ready, hopefully, GCC will proactively and frequently update the operational timeline and disseminate in public domain. As a next step, GCC must prepare a City Climate Change Action Plan which includes climate change-induced disasters, including health hazards like dengue and viral fever.",,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city and suburbs,"1,000 mm","Rs. 10,000 crore",464,1.8 million people were displaced from their homes,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage, and inadequate flood control measures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The destruction following the Cyclone Vardah shows that authorities in Chennai have done little to minimise the human-induced flaws that wreak havoc in the wake of disasters.

Cyclone Vardah

Chennai, December 25: History has yet again shown what happens to societies that fail to learn from it. Exactly one year after the highly devastating floods in Southern India’s cosmopolitan city of Chennai, nature’s wrath has once again hit the state of Tamil Nadu. The cyclonic storm ‘Vardah’ lashed out in full force at the city and resulted in extensive damage to both life and property. With winds blowing at speeds up to 140 kph, the central government had to evacuate more than 20,000 people living on the shores of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh to relief camps.

Trending Now

Despite, the last-minute measures, at least ten people died in the wake of Cyclone Vardah and more than 250 trees were uprooted across the city. Further, the loss of trade and property were so extensive that the Indian chamber of commerce and industry, Assocham, said that Cyclone Vardah caused an economic loss of Rs 6,749 crore ( $1 billion).

What is more upsetting than the aftermath of the cyclone, however, is the fact that for Chennai, the events bring to mind a sense of déjà vu. In December 2015, the city received the heaviest rains in 100 years, that caused floods lasting for weeks. With losses worth up to a whopping $2.2 billion and insured sums amounting to $755 million, the Chennai floods were historic indeed. However, as Cyclone Vardah shows the environmental lessons remain yet to be learnt.

While climate change definitely had a role to play, the destruction and loss can largely be attributed to human-induced factors such as pollution and infrastructural failure. With a population of over 8.2 million people, the city’s ailing infrastructure comprises of over 150,000 illegal buildings. Further, due to a constraint of space, the buildings have been constructed on, what used to be, thriving water bodies such as rivers, ponds and streams.

According to a report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs, the civic and humanitarian crises were perpetuated by the fact that the state had carried out inadequate flood zone planning and desilting was not done in a timely manner. The report acknowledged the following three reasons as being the main cause of the disaster:

The high-intensity rainfall was aggravated by large releases from storages beyond channel carrying capacity. Encroachments in lakes and river channels Congestion of drainage systems and their poor maintenance.

A similar cause for the extensive flooding was highlighted in a report by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), New Delhi, that stated, “Chennai has only 855 km of storm water drains against 2,847 km of urban roads. Thus, even marginally heavy rainfall causes havoc in the city.”

In the wake of the 2015 torrential rains, the central government had demanded that the following action be taken immediately to protect the environment and the people living the region, while at the same time ensuring that a repeat of the horrific disaster does not occur:

That the State Government check the mafia involved in illegal construction for business and usurping water bodies for their real estate business. That flood channels and riverbeds be cleared as soon as possible by removing illegal or unauthorised construction. Further, a strong directive was issued to the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority that despite the magnitude of the task, the city’s drainage system needed to be maintained flawlessly.

One year on, the destruction following the Cyclone Vardah shows that authorities have done little to minimise the human-induced flaws that wreak havoc in the wake of disasters. Rather than revisiting the construction and layout of key structures in the city, further invites are being sent out to usher in infrastructure development under “Make in Chennai”.

Some of the key structures that Chennai continues to harbour on expressly forbidden floodplains include the city’s airport, that has been built on the banks of the River Adyar and an intricate metro rail system built solely over the Buckingham Canal and the Pallikaranai marshlands. Many other IT hubs, landmark buildings, highways and roads, follow the same pattern of construction.

Apart from the fact that Chennai remains highly prone to extensive water logging, the cyclonic storm also shows that Tamil Nadu, like many other India states, remains highly unprepared to deal with the carnage caused by sheer wind. As the events following the cyclone show us, unless immediate action to rectify the existing wrongs and restore the environment to its original state is taken, nature will insist on teaching us a lesson repeatedly.

A little more than a year ago, another downpour over a few hours, too, had paralysed life in India’s IT hub. In their report, ‘Urban Floods, A Case Study of Bangalore’ (Journal of the National Institute of Disaster Management, April 2009), T V Ramachandra and Pradeep P Mujumdar, hydrologists at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, blamed floods in the city on the “lack of drainage upgrade works, the encroachment and filling in the floodplain on the waterways, obstruction by the sewer pipes and manholes and relevant structures, deposits of building materials and solid wastes with subsequent blockage of the system, and also flow restrictions from under-capacity road crossings (bridge and culverts)”.

They wrote that “the lack of planning and enforcement has resulted in significant narrowing of the waterways and filling in of the floodplain by illegal developments”, which has “subsequently caused flooding to other properties that have not previously been flooded”.

The repeated flooding in Bengaluru is similar to deluges that drowned Chennai in November 2015 and Srinagar in 2014 — even though those floods caused far greater havoc and tragedy. All are the result of urban planners giving the short shrift to a fundamental principle of hydrology: natural water bodies soak up excess rainfall and use it to replenish groundwater; inter-related drainage systems created by these ponds, streams, lakes and channels then release the excess water into larger water bodies — oceans and big rivers. Our cities are increasingly getting shorn of such ‘sponges’.

Bengaluru, Ramachandra and Mujumdar wrote, “is just one example of bad water management practices. Years of siltation of tanks have reduced their water storage capacity. Encroachments of nalas, lakes and other water bodies, choking of streams and stormwater drains, have taken their toll”. In a separate report, ‘Wetlands, Treasure of Bangalore: Abused, Polluted, Encroached and Vanishing’ (December 2015), co-authored with Sudarshan P Bhat, Asulabha K S, Sincy V, and Bharath H Aithal, Ramachandra wrote that 98% of the famous lakes of Bengaluru were encroached, rendering the city vulnerable to flooding even after normal rain. Bengaluru had more than 250 lakes about 50 years ago. Today, fewer than 10 remain in a healthy state.

The pattern is similar elsewhere. After the Srinagar floods of 2014, a report by the New Delhi-based nonprofit sustainable development advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) noted that in the past 100 years, more than 50% of Srinagar’s lakes, ponds and wetlands have been encroached upon to construct buildings and roads.

The demands of urban development very often turn a city into a flatland that militates against its natural topographical and hydrological features. But when there is excess rainfall, the water follows the city’s natural incline. Forgotten river channels sometimes spring back to life, but with disastrous consequences. Mumbai authorities had virtually forgotten the city’s Mithi river until the catastrophic flooding of July 26, 2005. What was once a flowing river had been blocked at every corner; there were encroachments and constructions on the riverbed and at the point where the river would discharge into the sea. In Delhi, a stream used to feed the Yamuna at about the same place where the busy ITO area is today. It is not without reason that the area is one of the worst waterlogged when it rains heavily.

Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai, Srinagar, Delhi, Gurgaon, etc. are all examples of human intervention that have rendered a city unfit to deal with a deluge. But floods are also a natural occurrence. In Assam and north Bihar, for example, they happen almost every year. In his paper, ‘Hydrology of Floods in South Asia’ (November 2002), Shafiqul Islam of the University of Cincinnati showed how a combination of weather patterns and topography leads to regular flooding of the Brahmaputra. As the ice melts in the Himalayas, the water channels downstream swell. When the river enters Assam from Arunachal Pradesh, it experiences a steep fall in gradient, causing the water to hurtle down at a furious pace. During the monsoon, when the river is swollen with the precipitation from the Eastern Himalayas, its channels can’t take the huge volumes gushing down at high speed. Siltation and sedimentation in the channels compound the situation.

There is, however, a human hand in such floods as well. With increasing deforestation in the Eastern Himalayas, the run-off has increased, which means as the water rushes towards the plains, it carries along more sediment. The riverbed in the plains is full of sediment, impairing the Brahmaputra’s carrying capacity. Earlier, the forests would soak up a lot of the run-off — somewhat like the wetlands.

In Guwahati, the human culpability for the floods increases. The deluge here seems similar to the ones in Bengaluru, or other Indian cities. Guwahati’s bowl shape anyway makes it prone to waterlogging; poor urban planning has increased its vulnerability. Wetlands that could have soaked up the rainwater or channelled them to the Brahmaputra are choked with garbage; they get clogged during heavy rain and the water spills on to the roads. A 2014 report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority said: “The city does not have a planned drainage system to take care of sewage, so the natural channels become all the more important. The condition of these channels are not very convincing as they are constantly covered with garbage.”

In December 2015, S. Satish, an electrician by profession, sent his family, which includes two children, to a relative’s house in Egmore. He stayed back at their flood-ravaged one-storey house in Periyar Nagar, Thirunindravur (near Avadi). He hurriedly turned a small room on the terrace into a storage unit, bunging in all household items. He lived in this now-cramped room, for the rest of the house was under water.

If that was any consolation, Satish’s house was one of around 2,500 single-storey houses in Thirunindravur that were almost entirely submerged in the flood waters. However, unlike residents of most of these houses, Satish stayed put in Thirunindravur.

Even after the flood waters had receded, Thirunindravur remained a ghost town for many months. Its residents had deserted their decades-old houses and migrated to the city and also to neighbouring districts, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram, in search of safe housing. In hindsight, this seems to be an extreme and gratuitous response.

Prompt response

For, a few months after the floods, Thirunindravur began to witness changes aimed at preventing flooding in the future.

The Tiruvallur district administration, along with the Thirunindravur town panchayat, started constructing a stone-wall along the Thirunindravur lake and in the process removed encroachments, mainly houses, along the waterbody.

It was, of course, a flood-control measure. It was also a move on the part of the district administration to restore Thirunindravur residents’ trust in them, and encourage them to stay in the neighbourhood during natural calamities.

“Two years ago, we never believed that we would be able to return to our houses after the floods. Now, things have improved. Better facilities that are now available to drain excess rainwater is a relief,” says K. Marimuthu, a resident of Thirunindravur.

Improving infrastructure

Other post-flood measures taken by the administration include repairing three-feet-wide field channels that drain excess rainwater from the lake to the farmlands in the neighbourhood; and constructing wide drains to connect the lake with the Coovum river and discharge excess rainwater once the lake reaches its maximum capacity.

“The Thirunindravur tank is of immense help to farmers here. Farming in the primary occupation here,” says T.V. Ravi, former Chairman, Thirunindravur Town Panchayat. “We have to protect the lake as well as the residents from inundation. For this, the permanent solution is deepening the lake and strengthening the bund.”

Earlier, of the six sluice gates at the lake, only two were functional. The defunct sluice gates have now been repaired.

Additionally, stormwater drains on the stretches in the town have been widened and connected to the lake.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

A new study has pointed out that flooding in polluted rivers has the potential to make groundwater unsafe for human use.

In December of 2015, when Chennai was flooded and people were marooned, a team of scientists from Anna University were collecting groundwater samples along the Adyar River to investigate if the groundwater in this region was fit for human consumption.

Researchers collected water samples from 17 locations in December 2015 and April 2016, that is, during and after floods. They tested the samples for salt and heavy metal concentration, microbial load and their susceptibility to available antibiotics.

“We wanted to know if the city water met water quality parameters laid down by the Bureau of Indian Standards during and post-flood,” the lead researcher, Lakshmanan Elango, and professor at the Department of Geology, Anna University, told India Science Wire.

The results showed that heavy metal and microbial load in groundwater samples was high. The samples contained microbes such as Enterobacter, Staphylococcus, Escherichia, Streptococcus, Vibrio, and Salmonella that are known to cause infections such as dysentery, cholera, and typhoid in humans. These microbes were cultured with various antibiotics used in clinical practice to treat life-threatening infections, to know they were susceptible or resistant to drugs.

“The bacteria were sensitive to most antibiotics but some were resistant to nalidixic acid, which is alarming as antibiotic resistance can rapidly spread in the environment,” said Elango. The results of the study have been published in the journal, Nature Scientific Data.

In addition, scientists found high genetic similarity between bacteria from various locations implying that they must have originated from a single domestic sewage source containing fecal matter. “Sewage must have washed off with flood water, which in turn inundates the wells that would have resulted in contaminating the groundwater,” says Elango.

“Our findings show that floods have the potential to impact the microbial quality of groundwater in affected areas. Based on our study, we advise that wells must be chlorinated and the public must be warned to avoid consuming groundwater for drinking, at least for some months post floods”, he added.

The research team included Ganesan Gowrishankar, Ramachandran Chelliah, Sudha Rani Ramakrishnan, Vetrimurugan Elumalai, Saravanan Dhanamadhavan, Kartikeyan Brindha, Usha Antony, and Lakshmanan Elango. The study was done in collaboration with the University of Zululand, South Africa and the National University of Singapore, and was funded by the Department of Science and Technology.

Knee-deep water, loose electrical wires and potholes are a common sight in the city now.

At a time when the city’s poor civic infrastructure and lack of planning is all too evident, it is a pleasant surprise to be on this one road in Thiruvanmiyur, which looks clean and almost dry, and that too within half an hour of the downpour.

Dr Radhakrishnan Nagar Main Road, connecting Kalakshetra Road and M G Road is not a ‘high profile road’, or the address of prominent politicians or officers. The same road had in fact been marooned during the December 2015 floods, but the reality today is vastly different because it now has a comprehensive storm water drain network and a safe footpath, thanks to the dedicated efforts of a citizen.

Meet Geeta Padmanabhan, a septuagenarian from the locality, whose perseverance has saved more than 3000 families and many more commuters the harrowing flood experiences that so many other Chennaites have faced ever since the northeast monsoon set in. Residents who woke up on Friday morning expecting to wade through the waters were surprised to see the clear road.

After the devastation witnessed during the December 2015 floods, Geeta, a journalist, decided to counter the inaction of the Greater Chennai Corporation by taking charge herself, thus setting the wheels of change in motion. The footpath Of Dr Radhakrishnan Nagar Main Road, which ran above the stormwater drain, was at that time taken up by illegal ramps, junction boxes and manholes.

Clearing the footpaths

Geeta is also the secretary of the newly formed association called RMSM (Dr Radhakrishnan Nagar, Malaviya Avenue, Sivakamipuram, Marundeeswarara Avenue) Peoples Security and Welfare Association. Her fight, however, wasn’t easy. Recollecting the struggle, she says, “The footpath work was incomplete when the 2015 December rains lashed the city. The house owners who had constructed the illegal ramps ganged up against me when I had them removed, and began to abuse me online and offline. I stood my ground, got the engineers to visit the place and made them follow my design.”

An architect couple from the neighborhood – N Deviprasad and Kavitha Prasad – played a major role by designing the road and changing it in accordance with the corporation’s plan. “They didn’t charge a penny for doing it. Their contribution to the project is invaluable,” Geeta says, in a grateful tone.

From the contractor to the corporation commissioner, she was constantly in touch with all the concerned officials to ensure the completion of the work undertaken. “I visited the office many times and kept calling them to inspect the locality,” she added.

Work on the footpaths was completed by June last year, after which she got the existing storm water drains repaired. “The drain has been around for decades. I just got portions of it redone and had a new one made at the S-bend to ensure smooth flow of water. The footpath runs on top, facilitating walking on this busy road. Either way, it is a win-win situation,” she pointed out.

Redesigning the storm water drain

Besides pursuing the officials, Geeta personally monitored the storm water drain work, ensuring that it got connected to a proper recharging medium. It is now well connected to the one on MG road from where the water moves towards Indira Nagar to escape into the Buckingham canal. In response to her calls, the assistant engineer at Chennai Corporation has cleared the holes leading into the storm water drain in Sivakamipuram.

Never say die

Drain repair was just one part of the job. In the run up to that, Geeta also got an old transformer, which was blocking the footpath, relocated to a safer place.

“It took me two years to get this simple task done. After that, I fought with the corporation for a footpath before they laid the road. It was a long and sustained fight at many levels. I submitted blueprints, brought corporation engineers to visit the area, quoted the Indian Road Congress rules and visited the Chennai Corporation several times to have the task completed,” explains Geeta.

So what is her success mantra? A staunch believer in the power of citizen participation, she says, “Never give up. Know the rules and learn about the duties and responsibility of the civic body.

Skymet Weather Team

Chennai rains have been lashing the capital city of Tamil Nadu for the past 24 hours. So much so that three-digit rains have been witnessed over the Nungambakkam observatory of the state capital to the tune of 116 mm. The Minambakkam observatory witnessed even more rains at 169 mm during the same time frame. Not only this, waterlogging has also been reported in many parts of the city.

While the rains were not as intense during the day, the night time saw heavy showers lashing the capital city. Hefty showers continued throughout the night time. The non-stop rainy episode has reminded the residents of the 2015 floods which had wreaked havoc over the entire city of Chennai.

The December in which Chennai witnessed record breaking rains in 2015 is something Chennaiites will never forget. The deluge had wreaked havoc over the entire city. The rain saga continued for quite some time and massive damage was observed in the city in terms of life as well as property.

This year, heavy rains have been recorded in Chennai during the last 24 hours. Not only this, forecast suggests that Chennai is expected to witness moderate to heavy rains during the next two to three days as well. This has once again evoked the unpleasant memories of the floods.

The 2015 floods occurred due to a depression which was persisting over the region. However, this time, only a cyclonic circulation is persisting close to the area.

Moreover, Northeast Monsoon which commenced on a lighter note has become active over the region. Thus, moderate winds have resulted in heavy showers over Chennai which are expected to continue furthermore as well.

However, we must wait and watch whether the quantum of rains will lead to severe flooding over the region or not. There may be waterlogging and localized flooding in some areas.

Things are looking up for sixty-two-year-old S. Rathnam, a marginal farmer in Poonamallee.

Around the same time two years ago, he was grief-stricken. For, the paddy crops on his three-hectare farm were washed away in the floods.

Now, on the same parcel of land, he grows paddy, groundnut, greens, brinjal and tomatoes. More significantly, over the last two years, he has been gradually making up for the loss he incurred due to the floods. Now, he plants crops three seasons in a year.

There are reasons to believe that Rathnam’s new-found happiness will continue, and the locality will not witness flooding of the scale it experienced in 2015.

Poonamallee Municipality has taken many steps to prevent such a situation. They include widening stormwater drains, bitumen-topping most of the 186 roads within its limits and clearing blockages and encroachments in channels carrying rainwater to waterbodies.

Most of the narrow stormwater drains had either been damaged or were blocked due to dumping of garbage. Some drains had disappeared as a result of encroachment.

“One of the lessons from the 2015 floods is that we have to keep water channels free of encroachments,” says an official of Poonamallee Municipality.

It may be noted that Poonamallee is surrounded by many waterbodies, including Porur, Mangadu and Chembarabakkam lakes.

Detailed study

To clear blockages in stormwater channels and water channels, the map of Poonamallee was re-designed after a detailed study of its topography. Old stormwater drains and water channels in the locality that constitute a water-carrying mechanism linked to waterbodies, were identified. With funds from the Commissionarate of Municipal Administration, work on widening stormwater drains and restoration of water channels were taken up last year.

Initially, this work was taken up on major link roads in Poonamallee. As per norms, regular stormwater drains are around three feet wide and five feet deep. After the 2015 floods, the width of the new stormwater drains was increased to 5.5 feet from 3 feet to accommodate surplus rainwater. Simultaneously, water channels passing through the neighbourhood and taking the surplus water from Chembarabakkam lake to Cooum river, were cleared of water hyacinths and garbage.

Small waterbodies within the neighbourhood like ponds and temple tanks were deepened. New stormwater drains are also being built on lanes to connect them to small waterbodies in the locality. Most of the flood-related projects have been completed.",solution,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city and suburbs,"1,044 mm","Rs. 10,000 crore",500,10 lakh people were displaced,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage, and encroachment of waterbodies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Chennai has lost much of its climate resilience due the shrinking of its wetlands and forest patches, which has drastically reduced the city’s ability to soak up excess rainwater

It is the network of blue and green that provides climate resilience to Chennai city — blue of its wetlands and green of its patches of vegetation. However, this combination that had been protecting the city in the past is today under stress. The shrinking of blue and green has drastically reduced Chennai’s ability to deal with extreme weather events.

Just 15 months after a massive flood in November-December 2015 battered the city, the residents suffered a serious drought during the summer of 2017. Even while sporadic rains over the city since the onset of southwest monsoon in June 2017 have given respite from the drought, residents fear that there could be flooding with the northeast monsoon in the coming months.

Chennai, which receives up to 60% of its annual rainfall from the northeast monsoon that starts by mid-October, is expecting this year’s rains to be at least average or better than that. With the city’s ability to deal with intense rains decreasing, there are chances of waterlogging and floods. Even by its very nature, the northeast monsoon that brings rains to Chennai is different to the southwest monsoon. The northeast monsoon is mostly a string of depressions or cyclones, which bring heavy rain over a few days.

Having suffered heavily during the end-2015 floods, followed by a severe water shortage during the summer of 2017, the citizens of Chennai are apprehensive of facing floods in the coming weeks. The destruction caused by the 130 km per hour winds and rains of Cyclone Vardah in December 2016 only adds to this fear.

“Unless the city’s landscape is resilient, the people cannot be resilient,” Jayshree Vencatesan, managing trustee of Care Earth Trust, told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “We are only coping because there is no other choice. Each extreme weather event hits us hard.”

Increase in built-up area

Using historical geo-spatial data, Care Earth Trust has developed maps that show the relationship of water bodies to built-up area in the city and the green cover within the city. As the blue (of the wetlands and water bodies) and green (vegetation cover) decreased in the past three decades over the Chennai metropolitan area, the red of built up area increased.

“Under the resilience framework, megacities are characterised as uncertain environments,” said Vencatesan. “We do not know whether climate change is causing the uncertainty or whether our messing up of the city’s environment is causing it.”

The development of the maps is part of a process to understand Chennai’s landscape and environment, according to her. There is inadequate data and insufficient understanding of the land use changes in the city and where population density is increasing. As a result, there is lack of clarity on the consequences of that change, especially with the ability to deal with extreme weather events. “We don’t have the detailed nuts and bolts understanding, and unless we have the data, our ability to deal with the situation is also not there,” Vencatesan added.

Even after suffering this summer’s drought, Chennai is apprehensive of the rains causing floods because of the 2015 experience, when between November 8 and December 4, there were five instances in which the city received more than 200 mm of rain in a continuous spell. The result of this downpour, combined with the city’s decreasing ability to absorb the water falling on its surface, led to the devastating floods, which resulted in the loss of more than 450 lives.

According to the annual estimates compiled by global reinsurance major Munich Re, the economic loss at USD 3.5 billion in and around Chennai due to the November-December 2015 flood was the second-most expensive event in the year.

Extreme rainfall events

There is evidence of increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events (EREs) not just in Chennai but also across India, even though their direct link with climate change is still considered tenuous. The 2012 special report on extreme events by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-SREX) stated this for the first time to policymakers.

A recent study by a team of scientists led by M.K. Roxy from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, published in Nature, states that there is a three-fold increase in widespread EREs over central India between 1950 and 2015. This is despite a decrease in mean precipitation and also a decrease in the number of depression-related events.

Other studies by the Interdisciplinary Centre for Water Research (ICWaR) at the Indian Institute of Science, and the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), have confirmed these findings for the Indian situation. See: Extreme rainfall leaves cities floundering

The ICWaR study even notes that the intensity of urban events is increasing vis-à-vis that of non-urban events.

Since there are indications of an increasing trend in EREs over Chennai, the network of wetlands and forests is important to provide resilience against such extreme weather events. These have been part of the natural landscape over which the city was built with rapid speed in recent decades.

Sponges on the city floor

For a coastal city with an almost level gradient, wetlands and forests serve as the points from which water recharges into the aquifer. They act like sponges on the city floor. The four rivers that run from west to east across the city — Araniyar, Kosasthalaiyar, Cooum and Adayar — serve as the drainage channels for excess storm water to flow into the sea. This network is complemented by the Buckingham Canal, which runs north to south across the city, and other smaller canals.

“The rivers and canals of Chennai have a clear role as flood control channels,” said Paul Appasamy, former director of the Madras School of Economics. “The natural hydrology of the city was forgotten and haphazard construction and development was done on the banks of the waterways obstructing their flow. This amplified the flooding of end-2015.”

There is an added obstruction to the flow of floodwater into the sea. Both Cooum and Adayar have a sand bank at their river mouth. Construction of the sea wall for the Chennai Port in the northern part of the city has resulted in coastal erosion north of the structure and accretion south of it. Thus, over recent decades, while the sea has eroded in north Chennai swallowing fishing hamlets and old temples, the Marina Beach has been growing in width. The very same process has been building sand banks, obstructing the flow of Cooum and Adayar into the sea.

Loss of blue and green

It was the loss of the wetlands and forest patches that drastically reduced the city’s ability to soak excess rainwater and use it during the lean months. Since the opening of the TIDEL Park, an information technology hub, in 2000, the city has radiated out through a southern axis almost all the way to Mamallapuram. This was at the expense of a network of wetlands that ultimately drained into the Pallikaranai marsh, before opening out into the city at Kovalam.

According to Vencatesan, there were almost 50 water bodies that were linked to the Pallikaranai marsh through a network of cascading channels. Many of them have been built over, and also removed are the natural forests along their banks. Radial roads that connect the Old Mahabalipuram Road with the Chennai-Trichy highway have bisected the Pallikaranai marsh along multiple axes. Embankments were created across the marsh to build these roads, thereby disturbing the natural flow dynamics in the marsh.

“The wetlands in Chennai are like the arteries and veins of the city,” observed Ritesh Kumar, conservation programme manager, Wetlands International South Asia. “These have been under tremendous stress from development pressures in the past two decades and have been losing their ability to hold water when needed and control floods during heavy rains.”

He felt that the Wetland Conservation and Management Rules (2017), notified by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change on September 26, 2017, can help conserve the remaining wetlands. “There are two points of strength for the new rules. First, it gives powers to the state governments to identify wetlands (which are not protected areas already) and develop conservation and management plans and implement them. Two, it stresses on the principle of wise use for these wetlands. Most of the wetlands are not no go areas, and they can be conserved and managed on a sustainable manner through wise use.”

The flood of end-2015, followed by Cyclone Vardah and the drought this summer, has given Chennai residents a sense of what it would be like to live through a string of extreme weather events. In some locations there has been civil society action, supported by organisations and governmental institutions, to conserve and rejuvenate water bodies. Perhaps these could be the initial steps in the process to strengthen Chennai’s climate resilience where the network of blue and green holds the key.

Induced by unplanned construction, the flood washed away the city infrastructure and became live example of what unplanned development can do to a city. A look at how the city is recovering and revamping its entire transportation plan to become a smart city by the year 2019.

Chennai is all set to be a smart city by the end of 2019. However the memories of the devastating floods is still fresh with the citizen that washed out tall claims of Chennai Municipal Corporation. All the city machinery, infrastructure and the urban local body’s claims about being prepared for the November-December monsoons failed terribly making it a case study for city planners across the globe. What went wrong with the city planning of the-largest metropolitan city of India, also a city of engineers, is still a subject matter for study and discussion.



Two years down the lane, the Tamil Nadu government is trying hard to gauge all the loopholes and mend them, especially for ‘Greater Chennai’, which is selected to be developed as one of the 66 smart cities, selected to be developed under the Smart Cities Mission of the Centre. The Greater Chennai Corporation has announced plans to upgrade this transportation, drainage system, and water supply. Under the ‘Smart City Project’, the focus will be put on to enhancing the storm-water drainage system which will prevent the water-logging and to a brand new pet-project, called the ‘Non-motorized transport’ system (NMT).



Storm Water Drainage



This project had been announced in around October 2014, looking at which the work is being done pretty speedily,” said J. Babu Rajendran, Chief Engineer of the Storm Water Drainage (SWD) Department.

“The proposal-making for the ‘Integrated SWD project’ began in 2011-12. The government is very enthusiastic about this project as it will present Chennai an edge over the other metropolitan cities,” he further added.



A major feature of this project is to collect storm water and channel it in a proper way so that in the future, natural calamities cannot harm the city like it did in 2015.

“Extensive work is being done on four different rivers in Tamil Nadu, including the Adyar and Cooum river which has already consumed an estimated cost of Rs. 1,102 crores”, said J. Babu. The Kovalam and Kosasthalaiyar Basin projects will start from 2016 as soon as they get funding from World Bank and other sources, he added.



The ongoing projects also include special responsibilities like convenient relocation for people, suitable compensation and minimising the harm to the environment.

“Generally, sewage and rainwater drainage pipes are put together in order to smoothen the water flow but it poses a huge risk of water contamination”, said Dr. S. Ganapathy Venkata, a Professor at Centre for Environmental Studies at Anna University.



This time the authorities have taken special care of the water contamination and separate sewage and rainwater drainage pipes are being constructed, which according to Venkata will reduce the water pollution level.



And he added that earlier there was no storm water drainage system in the Adyar river because of which water coming from Chembarambakkam Lake and rainwater flowed together leading to excessive flooding in the previous monsoon.



He suggested that if these problems were addressed properly and if the city authorities are able to plan the water flow, it would also solve the water woes of the city and would help in irrigation facilities, gardening and so on. Emphasising water reuse techniques, he added that these steps will really reduce the water problems in Chennai.



Non-Motorised Transport



Non-motorised transport is designed to give emphasis to pedestrians to engage in walking, cycling, for pushcarts and other forms of mobility that are powered by humans. The basic idea of this project is to ensure that the street design is favourable for the pedestrians and it aims to make the experience on the roads a cleaner, greener and safer one. By increasing the space for walking, they want to reduce the existing vehicles in Chennai. The plan is to make the roads user-friendly for the kids, old and the disabled by expanding the use of zero pollution modes of transport as well.



Every zone falling under the NMT would promote the use of public transportation. The plan also includes widening of roads, footpaths, making carriage-ways, expanding the vehicle parking space, increasing the illumination on roads, consistent signage on the roads and navigation systems guiding you to the next connecting transport system.



“In order to make a smart city, we have to see every aspect of a city from infrastructure to the basic facilities that are required for a person,” said Bob, an Executive Engineer of the Smart City project.



This project is an ambitious one and needs a huge amount of funds to make it possible, a lot of the funds for the storm-water project and the NMT has come from the World Bank and the rest of it is coming from other localised sources and about 60 per cent of the sponsorship fund has already been approved.



“One last leg of the project has to be approved and the rest of the fund is expected to be released by the next six months to one year or so. Rs. 1,200 crore is expected to come for the zone XII and XIII Greater Chennai project.","The project is expected to be completed by 2019,” said Bob. solution",Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Senior bureaucrats K Rajarajaman and P Amudha led the administrative machinery in clearing the flooded areas.Tambaram has six water bodies. During monsoon, the surplus from Peerkankaranai and Irumbuliyur takes its course via Chennai-Tindivanam railway underpass and reaches neighbourhoods in Perungalathur and Tambaram local bodies and thereafter Mudichur Road before joining Adyar river.Due to unprecedented rains in 2015 and the subsequent floods, the public works department has widened the Adyar river.“Since there is a rise in residential colonies in Vaniyankuttai and Peerkankaranai of late, the government has taken up work on a 1km-long storm water drain adjoining Chennai Bypass Road. It will be completed before July,” Velumani said.Raja recalled the need to remove encroachments in the water courses which are obstacles in draining flood water. He also complained that the underground sewerage scheme was taking many years to come into action.Velumani said the previous DMK regime had announced 55 underground sewerage schemes but issued orders only for 20 schemes, and completed one project. At least 17 schemes remained mere announcements.The Tambaram scheme was taken up in haste at a cost of Rs 160.97crore. The project was handed over to inexperienced contractors in November 2009. The scheme was delayed due to poor planning in setting up pumping stations.“There were lot of hitches and [the project] was moving at snail’s pace.

Chitlapakkam has seen it all—drought and floods, but this time, the floods have hit residents earlier than they expected. The northeast monsoon has just set in, and residents are left in the lurch, amidst miserable memories of the 2015 floods.

As I enquire about the route to Babu Street, a shopkeeper jokingly says, “Walk straight and take a left, you will see water all over the street. That’s the one!”

Babu Street, Abraham Lincoln Street, Pamban Swamigal Street, Chokkanadhar Street, Maraimalai Adigal Street, Balaji Avenue, Shanthi Avenue, Nazeeb Avenue and Ramakrishnapuram are a few of the major roads in the area that have been flooded. The affected places constitute around 40% of southern Chitlapakkam.

“It was around 01:00 a.m. when water entered my 300 sq. ft house, everyone at home was sound asleep. Most of my neighbours started shifting to the first floor, but I couldn’t. So we all sat crouched on a small stool until the waters receded. We faced the brunt of floods in 2015, nothing has changed except the year,” rues Selvi, a resident of Ramakrishnapuram who works as a dishwasher to make both ends meet.

Because of the continuous rains, water from the Selaiyur Lake overflowed and entered the residential areas of Chitlapakkam. Another reason for the overflow is the release of sewage water into the lakes here. The absence of proper water channels leading to Sembakkam Lake has resulted in inundation.

“The height of the roads is another major cause for the disaster and has added to the water overflow issue. The height is increased every single time the roads are re-laid. Instead of scraping off the roads, the new roads are laid over the old roads, which naturally has resulted in the level of the houses being much lower than the roads,” explains Bala Chandar, a volunteer of the group Chitlapakkam Rising.

If you go around Chitlapakkam, you can spot culverts in most of the streets. Experts also tell you that the very purpose of the construction of culverts has been defeated. Culverts are structures that are built for the water to flow under the roads. In the case of Chitlapakkam, culverts are designed like a bridge with no space given for the water to flow, thus resulting in water stagnation in the streets.

Who will take responsibility?

With no councillor and special officer in place, Chitlapakkam is awaiting substantial change. “We do not have special officers taking charge of our neighbourhood, an Executive Officer (EO) has taken charge. Since the former EO is on medical leave, Vimal Raj, the EO of Perungalathur has been appointed to look after the Chitlapakkam Town Panchayat temporarily. Talks are on for appointing a permanent EO for our Panchayat,” says Bala Chandar.

When asked about the precautionary steps taken to prevent flooding, Kamal Raj, former EO of the Town Panchayat said, “I was temporarily appointed, just before the onset of the monsoon, but I made it a point to de-silt the storm water drains in the area.” However citizens claim that no proper measures had been taken for preventing yet another flood.

“To prevent further calamities from happening, we have kept JCBs and generators for water supply in place and we have gathered sufficient manpower to aid the people,” says present EO Venkatesan on the emergency plan for the area.

Meanwhile, Amudha, an IAS Officer, has inspected the three lakes — Selaiyur, Chitlapakkam and Sembakkam and has planned to submit a proposal for clearing the encroachments along the lake.

331,870,chennai,2017,https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2017/04/torrent-water-concrete-imperil-chennais-boom/,24 Apr 2017,A Torrent of Water and Concrete Imperil Chennai’s IT Boom,"CHENNAI, India – Almost a decade ago, when the first of Chennai’s bleach-white IT office buildings replaced coconut groves along the Bay of Bengal south of the city center, leaders hailed the potential for a new wave of clean jobs. Nine years later, it is clear that planners did not fully anticipate the consequences.

Information technology proved so popular in Chennai that it is now India’s second largest IT center behind Bengaluru. But in bringing down protective coconut palms and constructing the dense strip of offices and contemporary residences atop water-absorbing coastal wetlands, planners put the city’s fastest growing business sector at the mercy of Tamil Nadu’s suddenly dangerous meteorology.

In the last 18 months, the IT corridor has been bullied by fierce flooding, a dangerous cyclone, and severe drought. New home buyers are starting to settle in other neighborhoods in north and west Chennai. Nervous IT office managers are weighing relocation.

“Ecological distress has always been a factor, but it’s surely moved up the value chain because of the last few years,” said Preetam Mehra, the head of Chennai operations for the American commercial real estate services firm, CBRE. “Chennai didn’t have a history of any major ecological events and hence that was not on top of people’s minds. Now, everyone is more diligent about where they invest, taking further precautions about how and when they want to invest.”

Seasons of Trouble

Chennai’s location along a dynamic coastline of warm, storm-fueling water has periodically put it in the path of extreme weather throughout its 400-year history. But the now 10-million strong metropolitan area has never been hit so hard as it has over the last two years.

“Ecological distress has always been a factor, but it’s surely moved up the value chain”

In November and December 2015, the city recorded never-before-seen amounts of rainfall, leading to flooding and complete inundation of low-lying areas inside the city as well as in suburban areas. The city received more than 1,700 millimeters (67 inches) of rain in a span of three weeks; 272 mm (11 inches) of rain fell in 12 hours on December 1. Typically, the entire month of December receives 191 mm (7.5 inches).

While even the most robust infrastructure would face inundation under such conditions, Chennai’s inadequate water storage and drainage infrastructure contributed to the flooding, which killed 470 people in the metropolitan region, according to state government figures. At one point, the Chembarambakkam reservoir, one of the city’s major water reservoirs, threatened to burst. Engineers responded by releasing a torrent of water into the Adyar River. All of the settlements along the 42-kilometer (26 miles) stretch of the river that runs through the heart of the city were completely inundated. The raging river rushed into already flooded lakes and ponds and drowned the IT corridor. Water rose to the second floor of some buildings. Chennai and its high tech business district were out of commission for two weeks.

Office managers had barely finished repainting and replacing water-logged furniture when Cyclone Vardah stormed in from the Bay of Bengal in early December 2016. The cyclone uprooted Chennai’s urban forest, downing more than 100,000 of the city’s 450,000 trees; power lines snapped across the city; and an undersea cable that supported the corridor’s online networks was severed. Again, it took weeks for normalcy to return.

Cyclone Vardah struck as the region was also in the midst of its worst drought in 140 years. Water scarcity has disrupted drinking supplies, contributed to rising food prices, and put India’s fourth largest metro area on notice that a new era of acute ecological disruption has dawned.

Not Business as Usual

According to estimates, the economic tolls of the flood and the cyclone were pegged respectively at $3 billion and $1 billion citywide. Chennai’s IT industry accounted for some $60-million worth of losses from the floods. Industry losses from the cyclone have not yet been calculated, though authorities project they will be consistent with the value of the flood damage because electricity and internet access were hit so hard.

“Luckily we make it a point not to have any offices in the ground or any of the lower floors, so that saved us from a lot of damage,” said Narasimha NK, director of finance at Ajuba Net, a leading business processes outsourcing firm. “The bigger problem for us was that the net connectivity was affected. We are heavily dependent on voice links. That was a big setback. The local government needs to concentrate on drainage, roads, and better public infrastructure, especially in the IT corridor. Having said that, extreme weather is a reality in many of the big cities across the world now.”

Information technology is a $150 billion-a-year industry in India. Chennai’s IT corridor hosts offices for some of the most recognizable multinational brands in software, outsourcing, computer design, engineering, and telecommunications, including Accenture, Amazon, eBay, Microsoft, IBM, Ford, TCS, Infosys, and Verizon. The city offers much to recommend for employers including a well-educated and skilled pool of workers, clean beaches, warm weather, and a sunny cultural disposition. Market research firms reported in 2016 that Chennai’s IT sector accounted for 15 percent of the $110 billion Indian software export market.

Formally launched in 2008, the IT corridor project was intended to amplify those recruiting assets. More than 200,000 people are now employed in 1.3 million square feet of office space. The corridor’s construction was divided into two phases. The first involved building roads and related infrastructure for offices and residences along a 20-kilometer (12 miles) boulevard. The second phase, not yet finished, extends the development 26 kilometers (16 miles) further.

Whether it gets that far is now in doubt. While the corridor’s linear design runs as straight as an arrow, its land use and infrastructure planning are scattershot. Local panchayat (rural development) bodies, mostly falling under neighboring Kanchipuram and Thiruvallur districts, were allowed to make decisions on land sales and construction. Development goals supplanted all other priorities, especially safeguarding the area’s assortment of lakes and wetlands. Big buildings and expanses of pavement replaced water-absorbing marshes. In particular, new residential construction and IT office space have steadily encroached on the 230-square-kilometer (90 square miles) Pallikaranai freshwater marsh.

“People need to understand that lakes, ponds, and other water bodies have great enviro-economic value to them,” said Arun Krishnamoorthy of the Environmental Foundation of India, which specializes in cleaning up and restoring water bodies. The IT corridor has some of the largest water bodies in and around Chennai which are now shrinking. “For me, the IT corridor is a model of how not to develop,” he said. “There’s no long-term vision for the area and we are now paying the price for this.”

Informal Water Networks

Local governing boards also left it up to developers whether to build a unified water transport and waste disposal system. Most chose to forget about it. Water is instead supplied to office buildings and residential communities by over 850 tanker trucks a day, each containing 12,000 liters (3,200 gallons).

To deal with sewage, buildings use individual septic systems. A few IT offices have taken a zero waste policy where all wastewater is recycled on site. Most, however, rely on sewage tankers to haul the wastewater to a nearby treatment plant.

The lack of basic necessities is proving to be a new deterrent for businesses in the aftermath of the floods and the advent of the drought.

The precariousness of the informal water transport network was first exposed in October 2014 when a strike by truck drivers almost brought business along the corridor to a complete halt. While the tanker owners called off the strike within two days, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry estimated that another day of strike would have led to $16 million in daily losses.

“I have always thought of Chennai as a city of corridors,” said A. Srivathsan, a professor at the Center for Environment Planning and Technology in Ahmedabad. “The city planners never thought of building a silicon city or an enclave. They wanted to stretch development to a larger region. But they didn’t think of developing integrated transport nor facilitating for basic infrastructure and services.”

“The promise was that once big-ticket investments came in, it would create linkages and generate jobs,” said Vijaya Bhaskar, a professor at the Madras Institute of Development Studies. “But basic public services are, for some reason, not considered important or critical, and that has been the biggest problem with the IT corridor.”

“The promise that the IT corridor was built with is only halfway there,” Bhaskar said. “But in many aspects it is already crumbling – the corridor as well as the promise. These companies usually tend to carry on until local resources are exhausted and then move on elsewhere. In Chennai, if these issues are not addressed proactively, the chance of resources getting exhausted, as well as IT majors shifting out soon, taking their business with them, is a serious possibility.”

Dealing With Disaster

The triple whammy of flood, cyclone, and drought revealed how vulnerable the IT corridor is to disruption. Companies are now busy writing contingency plans for environmental disasters. “Ecology is a serious economic factor in people’s minds,” said Preetam Mehra of CBRE.

Just how serious is a matter of dispute among IT office executives and city authorities. Many executives assert that Chennai’s business climate is stable and the city’s ecological torment is consistent with conditions in other competitor metro areas. They also said in interviews that the extreme weather events of the last two years are aberrations.

“As of now, it’s not a big issue,” said Narasimha NK of Ajuba Net. “Despite all the problems, Chennai, especially the IT corridor, is a better place to do business than other locations. We believe the risk of a flood sort of situation repeating again is not very high and hope the worst is behind us.”

“The lack of infrastructure is a relative factor,” said Aubrey Daniels of the American Chamber of Commerce in India. “The fact is that Chennai is a cheaper city to work compared to other cities. It also has a large, well-educated talent pool available, which is not the case elsewhere. I doubt there’s a serious risk of losing business. The ability to bounce back from catastrophe is high here. In case of disasters, if there is no power, companies are happy to run generators because they know that the city authorities will step up and restore electricity as soon as they can.”

Other authorities insist that the risk of serious environmental disruption is grave and likely to grow worse without evasive action. “It is a big risk already,” said Arun Krishnamoorthy. “Many IT firms get damaged massively every time there’s an extreme weather event. More importantly, they lose working days, which means a tremendous loss of business for them.”

“A lot of companies are looking at their business continuity plans in a big way,” said Mehra, including considering relocating. During the floods, many companies arranged for their employees to travel to Bengaluru and Hyderabad where they were accommodated for a few weeks before returning to Chennai.

“This is definitely a cause for concern,” said Krishnamoorthy. “The fact that Chennai’s natural environment is taking such a hit, not only because of extreme weather but also because of rampant development, will definitely affect business in the long run. The city, which has a reputation of being great for business, will lose its sheen if things continue as is.”",issue,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, India",November 2015,December 2015,Chennai,"1,700 millimeters (67 inches)",$3 billion,470,severe,"The floods caused major disruption to the IT corridor, which is home to many multinational companies.

When several roads in the city were marooned under water during the heavy rains, there was hardly a puddle stagnating on one particular road in Thiruvanmiyur.

Dr. S. Radhakrishnan Nagar Main Road, which was one of the worst affected areas during the December floods in 2015, remained spick and span despite the heavy spell. The road showed that a proper stormwater drain can prevent water logging, becoming a model for Chennai Corporation and the rest of the city.

A share in the success for creating the storm water drain network goes to the members of the residents welfare association who coordinated with the officials of the civic body to remodify and improve the ‘once’ defunct stormwater drain network. The residents in most parts of the city have come to accept the problem of water stagnating on roads even if the stormwater drain facility is present.

Improper alignment and the drain not being linked to the macro drain has often created such situations. The road running parallel to the congested LB Road is used by hundreds of motorists to avoid getting caught in the traffic jam.

A senior official of the Adyar zone in Chennai Corporation under whose limits the road falls said the residents badly affected by the flooding in December 2015 complained about the ineffectiveness of their stormwater drain. The same official in 2016 had identified that the flooding of the road was caused by non-linking of the drain network and obstructions in the form of various underground cables including electricity and telephone cables.

Citizen initiative

As part of the re-development of the storm water drain, all the cables were shifted to the opposite side and the drain network was linked to Malaviya Avenue, from where it fell into the macro drain and finally into Buckingham Canal.

Also, the stormwater drain was desilted regularly.

V.N. Dinakar Rao, coordinator, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association, Thiruvanmiyur, said the residents have been particular in not only seeking the help of the corporation officials to repair the drain network but also in ‘enforcing’ the upkeep of the footpath under which the stormwater drain facility has been laid by disallowing vehicles to be parked or driven.",solution,Chennai Floods 2015,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city and suburbs,1000 mm,"Rs. 10,000 crore",460,10 lakh people displaced,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage infrastructure, and encroachment of water bodies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The major affected States include Gujarat, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam among others. As per an estimate, there were at least 650 deaths since 1 June due to rain-related causes.

Besides the toll on humans, the recent floods caused considerable damage to animal life, infrastructure and the environment. It is against this backdrop, it is pertinent to understand the causes of recurrent floods, their impact on social and economic life and the necessary steps to mitigate the impact as well as to avoid their recurrence.

Causes

There are several causes of floods and they differ from region to region. The causes may vary from a rural area to an urban area. Some of the major causes of floods in India are given below.

Heavy rainfall: It is the primary cause for floods in India. Especially, rainfall in a short span of time is of much concern as they are leading to flash floods. For instance, in July 2017, Mount Abu received the heaviest rainfall in over 300 years in a span of 24 hours. The hill station received an unprecedented 700 mm of rain in 24 hours. As per a study instituted by the United Nations, climate change phenomenon is believed to be behind flash floods across the globe.

Siltation of the Rivers: Heavy siltation of the river bed reduces the water carrying capacity of the rivers and streams leading to flooding. For instance, as a result of siltation, the Brahmaputra has been expanding – ranging from 2 km to 14 km – leading to frequent flooding in the North East region.

Blockage in the Drains: Blocked drains are the primary cause for the floods in urban areas, especially in metros. For instance, failure of the drainage system is believed to be one of the primary causes behind the Chennai floods in December 2015 that led to the death of more than 400 people.

Landslides: They are the major reason behind floods in hilly areas of the north and northeast. For instance, in June 2013, landslides caused a blockage of flow of streams and rivers in Uttarakhand and caused major floods, causing 5748 deaths.

Apart from the above reasons, natural hazards like cyclones and earthquakes and encroachments of river banks and water bodies cause flooding.

Impact of recurrent floods



The most important consequence of floods is the loss of life and property. Structures like houses, bridges and roads get damaged by the gushing water.

Some of the negative impacts of recurrent floods are given below –

Impact on Agriculture: Recurrent floods impact the agriculture sector adversely. Due to recurrent floods, fields get submerged and lead to the loss of harvest increasing the vulnerability of farmers to indebtedness. The loss is not only for the farming community but also the common man is hit hardly due to persistent inflation. Besides, the threat to life of milch animals impact the farming community adversely.

Moreover, floods may also affect the soil characteristics. The land may be rendered infertile due to erosion of top-layer.

Damage to infrastructure: Recurrent floods cause severe damage to economic infrastructure like transportation networks, electricity generation and distribution equipment, etc.

Outbreak of diseases: Lack of proper drinking water facilities, contamination of water (well, ground water, piped water supply) leads to out break of epidemics like diarrhoea, viral infection, malaria and many other infectious diseases. The probability of outbreak of diseases in highly densed areas of India is high.

Besides the above, strain on the administration, cost of rescue and rehabilitation of the flood affected population are other causes of concern.

Solution – Mitigation & Rehabilitation



The solution to the problem of recurrent floods lies in mitigation and rehabilitation measures. Some of the important measures are given below.

i. Mapping of the flood prone areas is a primary step involved in reducing the risk of the region. Historical records give the indication of the flood inundation areas and the period of occurrence and the extent of the coverage.

ii. Land use control will reduce danger of life and property when waters inundate the flood plains and the coastal areas.

iii. The number of casualties is related to the population in the area at risk. Hence, in areas where people already have built their settlements, measures should be taken to relocate to better sites so as to reduce vulnerability.

iv. No major development should be permitted in the areas which are subjected to high flooding. Important facilities like hospitals, schools should be built in safe areas. In urban areas, water holding areas can be created like ponds, lakes or low-lying areas.

v. The buildings should be constructed on an elevated area. If necessary build on stilts or platform.

vi. The amount of runoff can be decreased with the help of reforestation, protection of vegetation, clearing of debris from streams and other water holding areas, conservation of ponds and lakes etc.

vii. Flood diversion measures like construction of levees, embankments and dams should be undertaken.

Conclusion



As per an estimate, 12% of India’s land is prone to floods. As per the Central Water Commission (CWC), floods resulted in a loss of 0.86% of the total GDP in the 1970s and 1980s. However, in the present decade, this share has come down to 0.1% of the GDP. Taking into account the growing size of the economy, still, the loss is huge. Hence the administration should take concrete measures on a long term basis to tame the menace of recurrent floods.

Mukilan Shankar’s works

Just over a month ago, Cyclone Vardah left the city in a shambles. Nageswara Rao Park in Mylapore, was in a disarray, with uprooted trees and branches marring its serenity. But last Sunday, those fallen tree spots came alive with art. The second edition of Art Mart , a concept inspired from Chitra Santhe, which happens every year in Bengaluru, saw over 50 artists showcasing their work to the public.From youngsters, newbies to established artists, this edition saw several people coming together for the love of art. While some of them showcased a mix of portraits, landscapes and doodles, there were a few others who caught one’s attention with interesting themes. Artist Jothi’s work was one of them — he had done a series on MS Subbulakshmi. He said, “I had done this series for her centenary year. She’s an icon and it was a pleasure working on her portraits. It has a mix of her childhood portraits, performance sketches and with her husband. I had done this for a gallery first, but the reception here has been fantastic.”Art tutor and artist Prem Nazir ’s works, called, Reversespective, was an interesting concept. “I took this idea from internet and began working on a series. It is somewhat similar to ‘perspective’ in art, but with a twist. When you see a painting, you can get only a front view. But this technique gives the painting more depth and one can see it in various directions, too.”We also spotted chalk sculptures by artist Kandaswamy , who had done miniature sculpture of gods and goddesses using chalk. Even calamities like Cyclone Vardah and the Chennai floods found their way to the canvas. Aritist Venkat says, “We went to so many spots during the Chennai floods. I found this image that appeared on a newspaper interesting. So, I immediately sat down to paint.”And there were novice artists, too, who showcased their work. For software engineer Sindhu Amritha Varshini , doodling is a hobby. Exhibiting her work in a forum like this has only instilled confidence. She says, “I don’t have a college education in arts; neither do I have any contacts in the art industry to showcase my works. So, a forum like this gives me an opportunity to showcase my works. You get varied interactions, starting from the normal public to art connoisseurs, who inquire about our work.”For Karaikudi-based Pandi Selvan, sketching bulls is a passion of sorts. “I grew up near Madurai, in the Chettinad Karaikudi region. I am a fine-arts student, who began by showcasing a series on windows. Having grown up in a village, the windows in each house fascinated me. But later, I took interest in sketching my own pet bull. I followed it up with a series on the life of these village people, who own the bulls. They treat it like their pet animal. The details on the painting are of the owners leading everyday lives with the bulls at home,” says Pandi Selvan. While he liked the concept of bringing the gallery to the park, Pandi also shares his thoughts on the kind of people who come to view these works. “A series like this might not interest a common man. Only those who are passionate about this, would be interested to see or buy. Gallery gives you the option of filtering the kind of audience who comes to view your work.”It was a first for 13-year-old Mukilan Shankar, who had come all the way from Madurai for this show. “I have been learning to draw and sketch for quite some time now. I have never gotten a chance to showcase my talent, though. A show like this gave me an opportunity to not just showcase, but also interact with established artists. I got feedback from many seniors on how can I improve,” he said.",discussion,2019 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",12 November 2019,17 November 2019,"Chennai, Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur, Cuddalore, Villupuram, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Tiruchirappalli, Karur, Salem, Namakkal, Erode, Dindigul, Madurai, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram, Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, Kanyakumari",494 mm,"Rs. 19,500 crore",46,"18.7 lakh people were evacuated, 1,33,000 houses were damaged, 12,000 km of roads were damaged, 1,000 km of railway tracks were damaged, 10,000 electric poles were damaged, 10,000 water supply pipelines were damaged",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Those areas of the southern and western suburbs that were flooded in December 2015 were also waterlogged on Friday, after Thursday’s heavy showers, though the situation was not as bad.

Roads were inundated in Mahalakshmi Nagar Main Road, Ambedkar Road and LIC Nagar in Madipakkam. Most parts of Mudichur Road were cut off for traffic for the third day in row. People were unable to reach their homes as cab operators refused to ply to the area. Some light motor vehicles made it through the nearly two-feet stagnant water in the area.

Krishna Nagar, Sriram Nagar, Vetri Nagar and CTO Colony in west Tambaram were badly affected as rain water entered several homes.

The residential areas of Old Perungalathur adjacent to Tambaram municipal limits too were affected.

Residents were vacating their houses to take shelter in relatives’ houses as the water had entered their homes. There was waist-deep water in the area, many houses were locked and the few who remained said residents vacated from Sriram Ram Nagar on Mudichur High Road in Old Perungalathur.

Aysha and Rihanna, sisters, said, “Water entered our house early Friday morning and the levels have been increasing. The memory of 2015 is still fresh in our minds, so we are moving out before it becomes worse. We will come back once the rain stops.”

S. Sadaiyappan, a resident of Old Perungalathur said, “When we first settled here a few years ago, there was no such flooding. Now there is no free flow of water from Perungalathur lake as the reckless encroachments on Pappan canal which is a tributary of Adyar River.”

I. Joseph, another resident Sriram Nagar, said the storm water drainage system here in the area was not proper and to make things worse, authorities had dug up roads ahead of the rains, but left their work unfinished. Our normal life has completely been affected.”

PTC Nagar and Royappa Nagar of Varadharajapuram too were inundated. Kancheepuram district authorities were taking efforts to clear the obstructions on the waterway. Agaram Road was once again cut off due to flooding throwing traffic out of gear and thousands of residents were stranded in their homes.

Due to incomplete storm water drain works, water flooded several homes on 100 feet road in Nanganallur.

Traffic on GST Road hit

Meanwhile, vehicular traffic on the arterial GST Road at Singaperumalkoil was affected on Friday morning as rainwater collected in a lake near this hamlet flowed through the carriageway to reach Chettipunniyam Lake on the other side of the road. The flow of rainwater across the carriageway in the absence of heavy rain took the motorists by surprise. The police rushed in and regulated the traffic so that the vehicles did not pile up on both sides of the carriageway.

Chennai airport during 2015 floods.

Chennai, Dec 6: The underground metro station at Saidapet will have a curved structure with high flood walls to protect Anna Salai from being flooded by Adyar river. The station has been designed in a curved manner as the land bends towards the river. “Two tunnels bend under the YMCA grounds at Nandanam towards Saidapet,” The Times of India quoted a metro rail official as saying. The newly built station is to open by March 2018.

In December 2015, Adyar river flooded the areas near the Saidapet station. Hence, precautions are being taken to avoid such a mishap. “The flood wall is at a height of seven metres from the river. So it will prevent water entering through the tunnels,” an engineer at the Saidapet metro construction site said.

A trial run by a four-car train is scheduled to be held by the end of December. It will run from AG-DMS to Saidapet. This will be done before the beginning of the official inspections for the approval of the project.

The tunnels are surrounded with six meter high flood walls so that it remains secured from the floods. “The tracks are getting finishing touches and so is the station. We will be ready within 10 days before we start preparing for the trial runs,” an official told TOI. The track is seven kilometer long. The route will connect Anna Salai to the Chennai airport.

“We have also built the tunnels in such a way that there is enough space for expansion of the road,” a site engineer said to TOI. It is said that in future, intermodal transportation services can also be accommodated in the station. Speaking to TOI, officials have said that land is available for 600 sqm parking space.

Whenever monsoon rain fills up the waterbodies in the city’s suburbs, there arises a conflict between the residents living around the lakes, who fear flooding, and the farmers whose livelihood depends on the storage.

Last week, bunds of several lakes were broken, including the Selaiyur lake, whose waters irrigate farmlands in Thiruvanchery and Madambakkam and the Rajakilpakkam lake from where water runs to Chembakkam and then to Nanmangalam, where agriculture activities are carried out.

A large area of ayacut in Nanmangalam and Nemilichery has been affected as the bunds were breached and water wasted. Farmers say that if the authorities had desilted the lake and strengthened the bunds, more water could have been saved in two lakes adjoining Selaiyur.

In Chengalpet area, farmers of several villages are worried that their irrigation tanks are not filling up despite rain in the catchment areas and in the chain of tanks that empty into them. Parasuraman, a farmer of P.V. Kalathur, said that a team of farmers were camping at Neenjal Maduvu flood water regulator that gets water from Kolavai lake and from areas including Kancheepuram, Ponneri, Paalur and Venkatavaram.

Road roko

While farmers want the water to be stored in the Maduvu, residents of Mahalakshmi Nagar, Rajaji Nagar, Anna Nagar and surrounding residential areas staged a road roko demanding that its shutters be opened to ensure quick draining of rainwater stagnated in their localities.

These settlements that came up near the flood regulator a few years ago are in a low-lying area and hence get inundated even with moderate rain or due to excess water flow from the lakes located upstream of Thenneri Kalvai. These colonies were badly affected and residents had to be rescued in 2015 floods when there was a heavy flow in the kalvai clubbed with the breaching of several lakes and ponds along the canal.

This year too, there is quite a bit of water in these colonies and residents are afraid it might be a repeat of the 2015 floods.

Water conservationist V. Srinivasan said that with changing weather patterns, farmers in areas that depend on tanks for irrigation hope the tanks will hold maximum water for at least one harvest.

“The residents in many areas are those who have bought land at cheap rates. This situation shows the government’s inability to understand the housing crisis. Even some of the LIG housing areas promoted by the government are on water catchment areas,” he charges.

“In such a situation, poorer sections of society are in conflict with each other. This conflict has to be understood in its totality. Merely advocating that they be removed won’t make things better. In Vengaivasal, for instance, when encroachments had to be removed, the District Collector shifted them to a place near Agaram. Now agricultural activities have resumed there. A wholistic view has to be taken by the revenue department,” he says.

“Most localities that are now flooded have been formed on channels leading into or outside tanks, or are on catchment areas of tanks where they should not be allowed to live,” says V. Suresh, National General Secretary, People’s Union for Civil Liberties.

“The government should map the encroachments and let the communities themselves decide as to what should be done if it wants to balance the need for water security. The present government is in an unholy rush to regularise irregularly constructed houses. This nexus between land sharks, corrupt officials and politicians is harming both gullible people and farmers,” Mr. Suresh said.

Memories of the ruinous floods in Chennai last year, partially blamed on climate change, have prompted many residents to raise the height of their houses to avoid getting inundated

If you cannot beat the flood, rise above it. This has become the mantra for some of the families with houses in the low-lying areas of Chennai that suffered severe flooding in November-December 2015.

As the string of low-pressure weather events that constitute the northeast monsoon for Chennai is beginning, the city is hoping that flooding like that of the last year does not occur this year. Communities are also working to build upon the experience gained from the last floods to prevent some of the mistakes and improve on the situation.

Rain scare

Even though floods of the magnitude that happened in 2015 were unprecedented, it left a scar on residents of Chennai, one that resurfaces every time rain is predicted. In November-December 2015, the city received the highest rainfall in 100 years. This – combined with the reduction of the wetlands and waterways system in the city – led to floods of the kind that left their mark on the walls of buildings and also the minds of people.

Located on the east coast of the country, Chennai receives most of its 1,400 mm annual rainfall between October and December. These rains are mostly in the form of low-pressure events in the Bay of Bengal that deliver short spurts of heavy rain over the city.

Living in a city with a flat terrain, most of the residents realise that their houses and apartments have been sinking in relative height to the adjoining roads over the years. While the ground on which their houses are built remains at the same height, the roads have been getting higher with every coat of asphalt. This means that when it rains the water flows into the housing compound from the road, adding to the flood impact.

Raising homes

Since residents do not have control over the rate at which the roads are laid, they have been looking at ways to increase the height of their floors, according to R.R. Krishnamurthy, professor and head, Department of Applied Geology, University of Madras. It is here that the possibility of getting specialist engineers to raise their homes has attracted the attention of the residents, and many families have opted for it, especially in the low-lying parts of the city.

“This is an example of innovative adaptation to a climate-related extreme weather event,” Krishnamurthy told indiaclimatedialogue.net. His team, in partnership with ETH University of Zurich, Switzerland, is carrying out a Climate Disaster Recovery Planning (CDRP) project in two legislative assembly constituencies of the city — Velachery and Mylapore. The aim of this project is to understand the social, economic and institutional mechanisms that came to the rescue of the residents during the 2015 floods, and the steps that can be taken to prevent trauma during future events.

“Velachery is a new part of the city which was affected badly in the 2015 floods, and Mylapore is the old part of the city that escaped heavy inundation. We chose these locations for a micro study, so that we have an idea of the resilience in different localities,” observed Krishnamurthy. This University of Madras department had earlier prepared the Climate Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI) for Chennai in 2010 for the Chennai Corporation, in collaboration with Kyoto University of Japan. They had followed it up with the Climate Action Plan for the city in 2011.

Faraway companies

Interestingly, the building contractors who have been doing the house lifting work come from as far Yamuna Nagar in Haryana. According to Rajesh Kumar, managing director of MCMD Engineering Works Private Ltd, one of the companies in the lifting business, though they have worked in many parts of the country in 2016, it was from Chennai they got most requests. As a result, the company even opened a branch in the city.

“We had good number of enquiries from Chennai after the 2015 floods,” Kumar told indiaclimatedialogue.net. His family’s companies together carried out hundreds of renovations in Chennai during the year, which was like boom business. For instance, on one street in Madipakkam (adjacent to Velachery), the floor heights of four buildings had already been raised and one was in the process of being lifted.

Jacked up

The lifting operation involves placing jacks under the plinth of the house and raising the building by one foot at a time. The raised area is then filled in with masonry, before raising the building by another foot. At Chennai the highest they have raised is six feet, at Madipakkam. Kumar says that their family developed and perfected this method, starting from the time of his father in 1991.

At a three-storeyed building being lifted in Madipakkam, construction supervisor Bachan Das and his team have placed a series of jacks along the walls of the house. Their aim is to lift the floor of the building by five feet, so that it is above the water even if it floods. As a lead worker shouts out instructions, workers turn each of the jacks by a predetermined amount.

Das told indiaclimatedialogue.net that it is critically important to lift all the jacks by the same amount, so that cracks do not develop on the walls. Once the building is lifted and the new walls built, soil is filled and concreting done to build the floor of the bottom floor afresh. The rest of the floors remain as they were before the renovation.

According to Das, the idea behind such renovations is to keep buildings intact at a cost less than a quarter of what would be required to construct afresh. At present they charge Rs 250 per square foot per floor for their work. Even with the cost of material being extra, house lifting provides an opportunity to owners to keep their floors above water without having to demolish and build afresh.

“This building is only eight years old and that is the reason we opted for this renovation,” said K. Sridhar, owner of one of the three apartments in the building. “When we built this house our floor was higher than the road. Now the road is higher so we need to lift our floor.”

Madipakkam, like adjoining Velachery, is a low lying area, and was prone to water logging even before the housing colonies started developing in the 1990s. Even before the northwest monsoon has set in, the empty housing blocks have standing water and reeds growing in them.

Adapting to climate change

Chennai residents’ opting for building-lifting technologies is a kind of adaptation to climate change. Due to its flat terrain and short spells of heavy rainfall, the residents of many parts of the city are used to water logging during the rainy season. However, the floods of 2015 went beyond what the city had experienced before, and hence the residents have started resorting to this innovative adaptation technique.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat defines adaptation as “adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects or impacts. It refers to changes in processes, practices, and structures to moderate potential damages or to benefit from opportunities associated with climate change.”

According to the Tamil Nadu State Action Plan on Climate Change, though the frequency of tropical cyclones may decrease in the future, they are likely to increase in intensity. Further, the trend in the state also shows that rainfall during the southwest monsoon has decreased whereas rainfall during the northeast monsoon has been increasing.

The combined impact could mean more events like the 2015 floods. Keeping the floor above water would be a way of dealing with it.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The global reinsurer said that the total insured losses in India were USD 1 billion in 2015, up from USD 971 million the year before. The severe flash floods in Chennai in November were the largest disaster, causing estimated economic losses of USD 2.2 billion. Insured losses were estimated at around USD 755 million, making these floods the second costliest insurance event in India and a large part of the losses originated from commercial lines. The event highlighted the vulnerability of rapidly growing urban areas to flash floods caused by heavy rains, said the company in its report.

Vulnerability to earthquake hazards

In India, uninsured losses from all catastrophes and man-made disasters were 84 per cent of the total losses in 2015, down from 93 per cent in 2014. Although the protection gap was smaller last year than in 2014, it was still high relative to global and regional standards. The global protection gap was around 60 per cent in 2015, down from 68 per cent in 2014. In Asia, the gap was at 81 per cent in 2015, down from 90 per cent in 2014.

Many cities in northern India are located close to the seismic gap in the Himalayan range. A seismic gap is an area where plate movement has already produced land deformation but – as of yet – not released the associated energy in the form of an earthquake. The likelihood of earthquakes in seismic gaps is very high, and the expected magnitude of such an earthquake in the Himalayas is Mw 8.0–8.5. Many Indian cities, including the national capital, Delhi, are close to the gap and are vulnerable to earthquakes. According to the 2011 census data, around 90 per cent of Delhi’s building stock falls in the category of unreinforced masonry, which is not earthquake-resistant.

Story highlights At least 272 people died from the flood waters in Chennai. Chennai had record breaking rainfall with nearly 16 inches in just a 2 day period Some of the hardest hit places were the slum areas like Saidapet

CNN —

It’s been a little more than two months since heavy rains flooded the southern Indian city of Chennai. Roads turned into rivers and thousands were trapped in the dark. In early December, the city could count nearly 16 inches of rain in just a two-day period, according to CNN weather. Between October and December, at least 272 people died in Chennai from one of the worst floods in over a century, according to the National Disaster Response Force.

The story hit close to home for me. I was born in Chennai and my parents grew up there. Family members sent updates on the devastation. It was difficult to see the places and areas I visited as a child in ruins.

I wanted to help. I mined social media and asked people to send in pictures and video. I was flooded with stories of heroism and survival. I set up a fundraising page in Atlanta and raised $9,000 through crowdsourcing and a fundraiser concert, pledging to go to India on my own dime to donate the funds to those who needed it.

When I arrived at the beginning of January, I found so many people banding together to help. Several charities set up centers where food was prepared and packed so volunteers could distribute it. It was heartwarming to hear stories where Muslims and Hindus provided shelter and food for each other.

For the flood relief, one group focused on repairing infrastructure like damaged buildings and schools as well as replacing equipment ruined by rain waters. The group, Bhumi, is an independent youth based volunteer non-profit organization in India whose mission is to educate and mentor children from orphanages and slums.

Other groups like Habitat for Humanity India distributed aid kits to families with essential supplies like mats, towels sheets and buckets. SEWA USA’s partner organizations in India helped out families in other parts of Tamil Nadu state including Tiruvallur and Cuddalore.

Most people in the city who had access to cell service or the Internet turned to social media for help. People created groups and listed drop-off/pick-up points for supplies and stranded families. The slum areas were some of the hardest hit especially in the suburb of Saidapet. The waters rose above bridges and decimated homes and lives. Many people in the slums said they had little warning and had to grab what they could and move to higher ground.

Even though the flood waters have now receded, it was wonderful to see how a city came together to help one another out.

344,883,chennai,2016,https://thediplomat.com/2016/10/is-chennai-doomed-to-repeat-2015s-devastating-floods/,28 Oct 2016,Is Chennai Doomed to Repeat 2015’s Devastating Floods?,"India’s National Institute of Disaster Mitigation has identified floods as the most recurrent disaster in India and marked 23 Indian states as flood-prone. It further categorized urban floods and riverine floods, indicating that each requires different control strategies.

In December 2015, the city of Chennai in south India faced one of its worst natural disasters ever in the form of rain-induced urban floods that ravaged the city. At the precipice of the monsoon in the state of Tamil Nadu, of which Chennai is the capital, it is important to look at how flood mitigation and disaster preparedness efforts are shaping up in the city.

After the AIADMK government that was in power during the Chennai floods was re-elected this May, Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa sanctioned $1.6 million toward putting flood-prevention machinery in place and desilting lakes and other water bodies. Earlier this month, Public Works Department Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami instructed officials to complete mitigation efforts by the end of October in Chennai as well as in the neighboring districts of Cuddalore, Tiruvallur, and Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu. District administrations and civic bodies in Chennai have met multiple times to ensure that systems are in place to pump out rainwater in the event of waterlogging. Palaniswami’s office has also reviewed the repair process of breaches in most of the water bodies that were worst hit last December.

The Chennai airport, which was among the worst-hit sites at the peak of the deluge, has been ramping up its preparedness efforts over the past ten days. A drone has been regularly surveying the airport to both look into mitigation and better understand how to divert water, which was a significant issue last year. Stormwater drains are being constructed in the parts of north Chennai that currently lack them and existing drains are being cleaned.

However, consternation among residents in the low-lying areas that faced maximum inundation is evident. Villages along the estuaries right around the city are equally frightened. The most common reason cited for this fear has been the pace of the implementation of flood-protection efforts.

In the areas surrounding Korattur lake, for instance, desilting began in February 2016 and has still not concluded. Residents and activists argue that the process is just too slow and have demanded the modification of culverts, emergency desilting, and an end to the periodic mixing of sewage and drinking water. Their arguments are laced with the memories of 20 days of pure inundation because of an improperly desilted excess water overflow canal. Repair work along the canal merging with the lakes nearby is still not complete either.

Even in the parts of north Chennai and the suburbs where drain systems are being revamped, the pace of widening roads has been slow. In the absence of wider roads, the entire process of revamping drains would be rendered useless – and already the height difference in particular concrete roads in the areas has raised the risk of water stagnation and mosquito breeding as the rains approach.

Right after the floods, as questions of repair, rehabilitation, and prevention emerged, the Chennai corporation indicated that 1,900 kilometers of clogged stormwater drains needed to be desilted. The mouths of rivers had to be cleaned of blockages and several thousand canals had to be cleared to have stronger storage capacities. The authorities themselves had expressed skepticism that all this work could be carried out in a few months’ time.

The reasons for this go deeper than just the December 2015 floods. Environmentalists, meteorologists, urban planners, and other analysts have, both prior to and particularly after the floods, provided detailed explanations of the inadequacy of the city’s drainage systems. They converge on the argument that Chennai is now horrifyingly flood prone due to breakneck urban expansion and the destruction of traditional drainage systems. Open spaces and flood plains with absorptive capacity are hubs of authorized and unauthorized construction.

A serious effort to look over flood maps of the city and reorganize dwellings in a manner that expands drainage is necessary. Planners in the city need to also bear such lessons in mind before proceeding with future projects. A huge amount of political capital is required to properly flood-proof the city and undo what reckless construction has brought about. It remains to be seen whether the government will mobilize this capital, but the past year has indicated that they are in no hurry to begin this process.

In the meanwhile, citizen groups like the Chennai Hub of the Global Shapers, a World Economic Forum initiative, have been organizing both citizen and expert discussions on lessons from the floods. They aim to evolve localized solutions to the problems and tap into proactive groups of individuals to mobilize the efforts required. For weeks last year, it was Chennai’s citizens that spearheaded relief efforts on the ground and through social media while contending with government delays. If the ten months that have elapsed since the floods are any indicator of how long-term flood mitigation plans are to unfold in the city, here too the government might take second place.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Floods ravaged parts of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry between November and December last year. The city of Chennai was the hardest hit.

Reports suggest that in Tamil Nadu alone, over 300 people lost their lives, nearly two million people were displaced, and preliminary flood damages were estimated at Rs 8,400 crores.

The floods were even discussed at the climate change negotiations in Paris in December, leading to another plaintive request for “concrete and urgent action against climate disruption”. This week, as another round of climate talks kicks off in Morocco, it is worth noting that such extreme weather events are expected to rise in frequency. Cities, which have a higher share of population and infrastructure, are particularly at risk.

But is there something to be learnt from every disaster? Does each episode offer crucial lessons that can become part of the area’s institutional memory for disaster preparedness?

Private sector interventions

In the case of Chennai, stories of tragedy and hardship were shared in real time, as were the rescue efforts of the government, the Chennai Corporation, police, and the armed forces. But in the age of social media, another unique account emerged: that of the interventions of a number of community-based organisations and the private sector.

Cities depend on a host of private services such as restaurants, retail stores, freight and delivery operations, schools, hospitals, hotels, taxis, and other businesses. Their understanding of the city, its geography, and the people they come in contact with, is unparalleled, and they form a critical part of the fabric of an urban community.

Early this year, two urban development specialists, who work in Delhi but were born and brought up in Chennai, decided to gather lessons from the Chennai floods. The organisation they lead, TARU Leading Edge, has worked extensively on cities and disaster resilience and is currently gathering evidence on resilience interventions in India and South East Asia as part of the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network.

""Building resilience requires learning from both experience and science for addressing new and emerging urban challenges,""said Umamaheshwaran Rajasekar, the TARU director. ""My colleagues and I wanted to capture some of the initiatives undertaken by various groups to manage the disaster to help others learn and incorporate such practices within their preparedness, prevention and response plans.”

The stories they collected, along with the attendant lessons, capture how a number of organisations were able to play to their strengths, and also employ innovative means to help the city in myriad ways during the disaster.

For instance, the Global Positioning System-equipped taxi service Ola Cabs formed a rescue team to transport food, water, and medical supplies to parts of flood-hit Chennai. What started out as a joke on Twitter – about Ola needing to provide boats instead of cars – was taken seriously by the taxi aggregator. Ola contacted local firemen and the Chennai Sport Fishing Company to gather details of local rowers and fishermen in order to provide free boat services in waterlogged and partially-submerged areas using information provided by the fire and rescue department. What is more, Ola replicated this effort during the floods in Allahabad and Varanasi in August.

In another part of Chennai, Kolapasi – a local catering service in Adyar, a neighbourhood in South Chennai – started serving free food to stranded people. It distributed approximately 6,000 food packets to people affected by the floods. Hotel Checkers in Anna Salai was one of the hotels that converted its banquet halls into dormitories for staff unable to go home because of the flooding. Many car dealers sent warning text messages to their customers warning them against driving through flooded roads. Car owners were also advised not to start cars in waterlogged areas to prevent hydrolock – a condition in an internal combustion engine that can lead to mechanical failure and engine seizure.

Having learnt from their experiences during the Kashmir floods of 2014 and Mumbai floods of 2005, automotive companies such as Toyota, Renault, Maruti, Hyundai and Nissan were better prepared to act through their dealers and service stations in Tamil Nadu.

Giving a hand

Similarly, after the Union government announced that the state-owned BSNL would not charge its customers for a week during the flooding last year, other telecom companies followed suit, providing their customers with free talk time.

Servals Automation, a Chennai-based social enterprise that provides rural energy products, started a programme called Marumalarchi to distribute cooking fuel and stoves to migrants and slum dwellers so that they could cook food and boil water, two critical requirements, in a flood-hit area.

For every account of hyper-inflated costs of water, vegetables, and airline tickets, and the government’s intervention to check these practices, there were stories of positive efforts by private entities, driven, no doubt, by civic responsibility, but also positive brand implications in the long run.

There is an untapped potential for the private sector to provide skilled services in the form of technical manpower or in-kind donations of their goods or services during emergency situations. In addition, in a situation when timing is key, a number of these agencies have local knowledge and distribution networks to help fill crucial gaps in government efforts. Rather than a one-off exercise in volunteerism, therefore, a greater collaboration between the public and private sectors is merited.

In the case of India, the newly drafted National Disaster Management Plan talks about private sector inclusion but from the perspective of businesses integrating disaster risk into their management practices and providing technical support during reconstruction efforts. Their role during emergency response is not spelt out. Through incentives and mandates, relevant businesses – not just national but also local entities– can be co-opted at the state and municipal level in disaster management initiatives.

Helping themselves

But what is in it for these companies? Businesses themselves are at risk from climate impacts during extreme weather events, in the form of supply chain disruptions, structural damage, and impacts on employees and thereby operations.

According to the CDP Global Cities Report, it is estimated that 80% of the global Gross Domestic Product is generated in cities, and assets worth $4 trillion are at risk from climate-related events in cities.

In Chennai, micro, small and medium enterprises lost an estimated Rs 1,700 crores due to the floods last year. Moreover, persistent rainfall and flooding forced several major automakers in the region to shut operations, thereby also incurring losses. It is evident that private sector efforts and investment in disaster risk resilience at every stage would not just aid cities, but help their businesses in turn too.

In May, barely five months after the floods, Chennai received 20 cm of rain in 24 hours, leaving parts of the city waterlogged. People feared the worst again. Although Cyclone Roanu, which caused the conditions that led to this excessive rain, ultimately did not hit the region, Chennai was better prepared this time with Indian Administrative Services officers, medical teams, and equipment like water pumps on standby. Such efforts at preparedness can be further complemented by co-opting private sector organisations – they are intrinsically linked to cities and have much to lose during extreme weather events, but also have much to offer to help the city get back on its feet.

Bangalore: Chennai city was utterly paralysed and crippled to a complete stand still when heavy rains caused major flooding during the November –December period last year. The situation was extremely bad.It not only had disrupted the lives of hundreds and thousands of people, but also major businesses and organizations in the city, including IT and software companies, automakers, media houses, financial institutes and others had to halt their operations and services leading to huge business and financial losses.In fact, the global economic losses from natural catastrophes in 2015 stood at $123 billion, according to Aon’s Annual Global and Catastrophe report released early this year.Flood, severe thunderstorm and wildfire are among top three costliest perils that accounted 59 percent of all economic losses during 2015, the report reveals.However, CAMS (Computer Age Management Services) one of India’ top mutual fund transfer agency was among the very few businesses that were able to sustain their operations and functions amidst that extreme flooding.According to N Ramakrishnan, CIO – CAMS, the reasons why company’s business operations and services remained undisrupted were mainly because staffs’ tremendous commitment, high quality of BCP Business Continuity Plan ) and its governance mechanism and lastly, the technology infrastructure.“Even during the Chennai floods CAMS was able to actually work and deliver services and meet our SLA (service level agreement) commitments on time,” Ramakrishnan says.Certainly, to achieve such feat, organizations would need to put huge combined efforts with precise planning, regular practise and flawless execution. However it’s interesting to know and understand about CAMS’ core IT infrastructure planning and its management.CAMS as a RTA (registrar transfer agent) holds nearly 62% of the mutual fund industry data in India, which basically is public information and as a custodian of information, it strongly believes in managing and keeping IT in-house and not outsourced.In fact, it has three datacentre s – two within Chennai city and one in Coimbatore. Among the two Chennai datacentres, one is actually a standby in-city datacentre but all these three datacentres are identical in all aspects, which mean equal stand alone functional capabilities.“All the three datacentres carry identical hardware components in terms of user experience, network security and capacity management. That means, any of the three datacentres in isolation can support production volumes on a standalone basis even if any of the two datacentres fail,” Ramakrishnan explains.This allows data replication from the primary datacentre to the other two datacentres on a real-time basis. And this actually generates, two extra copies of same data at any point in time, which according to Ramakrishnan is backed by a well-defined recovery point (RP) and recovery point objectives (RPOs).From BCP perspective, this mechanism makes CAMS well-equipped to switch over from primary to standby or secondary datacentre in case of any disasters, but without causing any sort of impact on company’s business operations and services.Ramakrishnan says even if the primary datacentre suffers any hardware failure, there won’t be any issue due to the immediate switch-over to the in-city standby datacentre and business will be as usual.In anticipation of Chennai floods like situations, CAMS already has already set up its third BCP led datacentre in Coimbatore, which is in a live functioning mode and managed by its staff.“We have BCP orderly not only from a hardware perspective, but also people perspective, which are qualified staff to manage critical functions in case of a city level disaster,” Ramakrishnan informs.But having BCP alone would not be enough to save organizations against any disasters unless BCP drills are practiced regularly, tested and are considered as an integral part of their business operations. In fact, that’s what Ramakrishnan has been doing continuously at CAMS during its close to three decades existence.“We do periodic BCP drills and it is part of our smart processes. We actually simulate the BCP drills by completely shutting down our datacentres and then try to ensure that we are able to operate and service our clients on production basis using our BCP through our Coimbatore datacentre,” Ramakrishnan points out.Further, “We practice this to ensure that all the services offered from our Chennai based primary datacentre are actually being carried out from Coimbatore datacentre. That’s a yardstick we try to follow,” he adds.Ramakrishnan although emphasizes on the BCP drills but he does admit that at times this process may cause some sort of impact on certain services.“There might be hard situations where the Coimbatore datacentre may unable to provide some services related to a specific unit, which were offered from Chennai datacentre. And this can only be found out by performing constant and regular BCP drills,” Ramakrishnan comments on the significance of BCP drills and testing BCP led datacentre service capabilities.Conducting BCP drills regularly, according to Ramakrishnan actually has helped his organization to find out those gaps and fix them and then accordingly improve on every factor of BCP drills. “And this is how we can actually respond to disasters and natural calamities,” he says.Besides, CAMS has a well-defined call tree structure that ensures each staff knows whom to call and how to act at the time of calamity. “Along with staffs, top management is also committed to call tree invocation like grouping, identifying and responding to any kind of situation. This is part of our culture and also a part of BCP factors,” concludes Ramakrishnan.",solution,Chennai Floods 2015,"Chennai, India",November 2015,December 2015,Chennai city,1000 mm,$123 billion,250,Huge business and financial losses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The State government has honoured 26-year old S. Mohammad Yunus for his “selfless, noble and brave act” of rescuing nearly 2,100 people during the recent floods that devastated Chennai.

“If you had met me a few months back, you would have been shocked. I used to work like a money-making machine. I was never a social person. The floods taught me a great lesson. It was an eye-opener to me,” he said after receiving the ‘Anna Medal for Gallantry’ from Chief Minister Jayalalithaa at the 67 Republic Day celebrations.

Now, he wants to teach politics and reform the youth. “I’m developing an app with focus on entrepreneurship, reforms and politics. It will be up ready and operational in three months. This will be similar to social networking apps,” Mr. Yunus said.

Mr. Yunus is looking for funding for his new venture of developing apps. “I’m looking for Venture Capital funding and some have already approached. You will see something big.” Entrepreneurship is not new to him. Yunus runs a real estate firm that helps middle class families search properties based on algorithm.

According to the citation, Mr. Yunus was instrumental in the rescue of nearly 1,500 people during the November 17 floods and accommodated them in nearly 300 houses.On December 2, he rescued nearly 600 people when the city went underwater. He also rescued a pregnant woman, Chitra, along with her husband Mohan in Urapakkam and admitted her at a hospital in Perungalathur.

Chitra gave birth to a girl baby a day later and the couple named their daughter Yunus.

FLOOD OF CARS

To get rid of the cars and vehicles damaged during the Chennai floods, the insurance companies are selling these off at huge discounts: No. of cars damaged: 80,000

(including two-wheelers), totally or partially damaged

Totally damaged (written off): 20,000 cars



Already sold

About 4,000



Sellers: Insurance companies that have ""written off"" the damaged cars



Benefit for customers: 25-40%

Luxury cars can be bought at discounts of 25-40 per cent (of the insured value)



Facilitators: Companies that help in buying and selling old cars, such as cartrade.com and cardekho.com



Major buyers:

Used car dealers and those who modify cars

To have a Jag or a Merc is a dream for many. Now, the dream is coming true in Chennai, with models of luxury cars being sold at dirt cheap prices.How? About 80,000 vehicles - including two-wheelers - were damaged during the Chennai floods in November last year. Of these, about 20,000 were declared to be ""fully damaged"" and written off by insurance companies.Now, the insurers who have acquired this inventory are selling off the cars - in the open market, and yard and online auctions - for 25-45 per cent of their insured declared value (IDV).Car dealers from all over the country are flocking to the southern metropolis to buy these cars.But why would someone buy a damaged vehicle?Take an example: The on-road value of a Jaguar F-Type is about Rs 2.2 crore. In Chennai, if you are lucky, you could get one for as low as Rs 15-25 lakh.Add the cost of refurbishment to it (about Rs 5-10 lakh), and it is still dirt cheap.Of late, garage owners and dealers of used cars are flocking to Chennai - they comprise about 96 per cent of the buyers.If the cars are beyond repair, they can be turned into scrap. Others can be repaired and sold off.Dinesh Pathania, the managing director of Autoworld, a Delhi-based bulk used car dealer, is in Chennai. He said he had already bought and sold about 500 of these cars. Of these, 70 to 100 were luxury cars such as Mercedes and Audis.""I'm expecting a batch of another 100 luxury vehicles in 10-15 days, and shall sell them to smaller traders and used car dealers,"" Pathania said.The insurance companies, too, are benefiting from this sale, as it is helping them cut some of the losses.A source in the sector said: ""If a car is totally damaged, the insurance company might have to shell out as much as Rs 80 lakh - an IDV of around Rs 1-1.2 crore. In this case, there is no chance of recovering the money.""However, if the insurance company does not pay the entire IDV to the consumer, there is hope that the car might even fetch 45 per cent of the IDV, thus offsetting the losses to some extent.""Ravi Mehra, president, auctions, CarTrade.com, told Business Standard, ""The inventory of damaged vehicles (those that have been written off) is around 20,000. Considering the average price of a vehicle at Rs 6 lakh (it ranges from Maruti Alto to Jaguar F-Type), the size of the inventory is around Rs 1,200 crore.""Around 4,000 vehicles have already been auctioned off, and 400-450 vehicles are being auctioned every week, Mehra added.Another online portal, CarDekho.com, however, pegs the number of lost assets to insurance companies at 10,000-12,000 units.Abhishek Gautam, chief operating officer, CarDekho auctions, elaborated, ""For flood-damage vehicles, there are basically in three categories: First, C-level: Water damage till floor or carpet level; second, B-level: water damage till dash-board level; and third, A-level: water damage till the roof. Depending upon the damage, cars can be sold for anything between 20 and 50 per cent of the original value.""",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

2015 has been one of the worst years for aviation losses from an insurance perspective

Eight private jets owned by corporate houses were irreparably damaged in the Chennai floods last December. The planes had been submerged under water for a prolonged period and the water entered the entire aircraft.The eight jets, belonging to TVS Motor, Sun TV, Kalyan Jewellers, the Joyalukkas group and others, have a combined insured value of around Rs 500 crore and the entire claim value will have to be borne by insurance companies.Among the damaged jets, Sun TV’s Bombardier Global Express carries the highest insured value (about Rs 260 crore). The other seven — Phenom 100, Embraer 500, Piaggio Avanti, Hawker 900XP, Learjet 60XR, Gulfstream G200 and Hawker Beechcraft Premier — are valued between Rs 18 crore and Rs 60 crore.Sun TV and TVS Motors did not comment on the issue.Chennai-based United India Insurance, among other insurance companies, has been involved in the process of assessing the claims through surveyors and loss assessors. Oriental Insurance and some private insurers were also involved and took a hit due to the floods. The share of public insurers was much higher.In addition to the damaged jets in Chennai, insurers will also have to bear the loss claims of four helicopters and claim for damage to a SpiceJet aircraft in an animal collision incident in Jabalpur, making 2015 one of the worst in losses for insurers in India, according to Global Insurance Brokers.“The damages to the jets and its parts are severe and cannot be restored. Hence, we will have to dismantle and sell parts as scrap, though we will only be able to recover 20-30 per cent of the costs,” said the head of a public sector general insurer, which had exposure to these jets.The Chennai aircraft manufacturers, including Hawker, Embraer and Bombardier, have called for an evaluation of the damaged jets.“The manufacturers ruled the aircraft are beyond economical repair,” said Sakeer Sheik, managing director of Titan Aviation, which manages aircraft belonging to V M Aviation, Garuda Jet and Kalyan Jewellers, whose jets were among those.The cost of repair would be higher than the current fair value of these aircraft, sources said.“Globally, the Chennai floods may not be considered as a big loss in the aviation sector. However, we have never faced this big a hit in this segment, which will directly hurt our books. Some part of it was reflected in the third quarter and some of it will be visible in the fourth quarter,” said the general manager at a public general insurance company.Insurers expect premiums to go up in aviation insurance. There have been some indications of an increase in reinsurance premium.“Year 2015 was one of the worst in aviation losses for insurance companies in India. There were four helicopter accidents last year, leading to three total loss claims by Pawan Hans and one by Himalayan Heli Services.

Cities offer ideas to solve Chennai's flooding problem,"When the floods came last December, the city of Chennai and its surrounding districts in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu were caught cold. Amid dramatic scenes of flooded streets and devastated homes, 347 people died across the state and damage valued at more than 20,000 crore rupees ($3bn) was sustained – with Chennai the largest city affected.

The highest level of rainfall for 100 years, together with clogged and shrunken river mouths, encroachments on river banks, blocked natural drainage pathways and a lack of early flood-warning systems all contributed to the drowning of this coastal city.

Originally an area comprising wetlands and numerous lakes, Chennai is now a concrete jungle – the product of a rapid and chaotic development (powered in part by India’s booming automotive industry) that has shrunk its three rivers and built over most lakes and swamps surrounding the city.

Since the floodwaters receded, the city has had to clean up tonnes of garbage – but it did successfully prevent any epidemic from breaking out. Life is almost back to normal as roads are slowly resurfaced and damaged vehicles, goods and machinery are replaced.



Chennai is about water bodies and we need to work with water to reinvent the city Jayshree Vencatesan

In the aftermath of the disaster, the city’s authorities were quick to seek advice from other cities whose experience of flooding – and pioneering plans to alleviate flood risk – could ensure Chennai is less badly affected the next time the rains hit with such force.



“The challenge is not resources – the challenge is how will Chennai use its resources?” says Vikram Singh from 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), the global initiative funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. “Cities, at moments like this, need to learn and adapt – but also grow better and stronger.”

“Chennai’s agenda needs to be blue,” says Jayshree Vencatesan from Care Earth, a nonprofit working in the field of conservation. “Chennai is about water bodies and we need to work with water to reinvent the city. It is illogical that residents of the city pay to buy water for their daily needs while we are witnessing floods.”



Last month the city’s municipal body, the Greater Chennai Corporation, organised a seminar with 100RC in which international experts on flood management put their heads together with local experts to come up with a comprehensive plan to build a stronger, more flood-resistant Chennai. These are some of the cities and projects that Chennai attempted to learn from.

Georgetown, Guyana

Chennai and the Caribbean city of Georgetown may be 15,000 km apart, but the problems they face are the same. Rapid unplanned urbanisation in Georgetown, as in Chennai, has resulted in what was once a well-connected network of canals and drains being built over. Floods now frequently inundate Guyana’s capital, and it has brought in experts from Arcadis, a global design and engineering firm, to come up with a plan on how to handle the problem.

Analysis of water flow in Georgetown’s 200-year-old drains network revealed one immediate problem: “Maintenance of water discharge channels is key, so we decided to recommend small floating dredging equipment which would keep the canals free of obstructions,” says Rob Steijn from Arcadis. Most strikingly, the team asked the Georgetown authorities to import a manatee – that fully aquatic, mainly herbivorous mammal – into the canals, to eat the vegetation clogging them and enable a freer flow of water.

“Chennai’s rivers need to be cleaned up first, and obstacles and debris removed from them,” Steijn says. “Government needs to ensure that there is space for pumping stations in future plans; don’t build hotels before these. There needs to be a sustained awareness campaign first – people have to understand the dos and don’ts of living near water.”

Lent, Netherlands

As the pioneers of flood mitigation systems, the Dutch have battled floods for centuries as they protect a country that lies partly below sea level. The Dutch government, in 2006, began implementing a €2.3bn (£1.8bn) project called “Room for the River”. The idea was simple: make more room for the river to overflow, rather than building right on its banks.

The Dutch government has worked on creating more room for the rivers IJssel, Lek, Maas and Waal. At the neck of the river Waal in Nijmegen, flooding regularly occurs as the river bends in the form of a bottleneck between Lent and Nijmegen. The Dutch decided to make more space for the river to flow, in a bid to curb the strength of the floodwaters and protect the residents of Lent.

A dike in Lent was moved inland by 350 metres and an ancillary channel, 150 metres wide and 3km long, was dug in the flood plains. This move resulted in a small island being formed, and a bridge was built to connect it with Lent. The idea, according to the Room for the River project, was that the river would no longer flow along the city, but through it instead.

Never think about solving a water problem​. Learn to embrace it and live with it ​Henk Ovink

A new waterfront at Lent has been developed, with a paved sloping surface that disappears into the water. The quay itself has been designed to be another urban open space where cyclists and walkers can enjoy the sights of boats and the river. The new “green dike” is accessible to cyclists, strollers and emergency vehicles.

Flood plains and river beds across the Netherlands were deepened, and construction along rivers was systematically removed to create open public spaces that, in the event of floods, would be inundated, avoiding damage to property and loss of life. “It took us 10 years to do all this,” says Henk Ovink, the Netherlands’ special envoy for water affairs. “We gave up urban and farm land for the river. But we have increased development potential because of this.”

Ovink feels that Chennai has great scope for implementing projects similar to Room for the River along all three of its rivers – the Adyar, the Kosasthalaiyar and the Cooum. “Never think about solving a water problem,” he says. “Learn to embrace it and live with it.”

In 2007, global attention turned to the Indonesian capital Jakarta as floods ravaged this bustling megacity, displacing at least 340,000 people from their homes. Once again, Jakarta and Chennai share many similarities: both are coastal cities with rivers running through them, and both cities are sinking – a phenomenon known as subsidence – due to extreme extraction of ground water and unplanned construction.

After the 2007 floods, the Indonesian government roped in Dutch water research institute Deltares to find lasting solutions to the problem of flooding. The team decided to open up a new channel that would take floodwater out into the sea rather than letting it run through the city.

“A new flood channel is a possibility that Chennai could look into,” says Kees Bons of Deltares. “Another option is to create what the Dutch call a ‘polder’ – an enclosed area of reclaimed land which is very low-lying, so that water cannot flow due to gravity. These polders hold the water in and they can then be pumped out using powerful machinery.” According to Bons, the use of polders means it would not be necessary to raise the areas surrounding the river. “Don’t work against the forces of nature,” he advises. “Study the systems and use the energy of nature.”

New Orleans, United States

In 2005 Hurricane Katrina devastated the city of New Orleans, leaving almost 1,500 people in the city and surrounding areas dead. After much soul searching, in 2010 the Greater Orleans Urban Water Plan was finally implemented: an attempt to create what its architects called a “Living Water System”, where canals were widened and their surroundings turned into green public spaces. New Orleans has since also put in place pervious pavements, which allows rainwater to pass through them into underground storage basins.

“Chennai and New Orleans share the problem of subsidence, and people need to be aware that sucking out the groundwater will cause the city to sink further,” says David Waggonner, president of Waggonner and Ball architects who designed and led the New Orleans water plan. “Chennai can definitely implement what New Orleans did – make a blue city instead of a grey city full of concrete.”

Waggonner also cautions the city authorities against opting for purely engineering solutions. “We have huge engineering systems to pump out water in New Orleans which failed,” he says. “Engineering systems will fail. Chennai needs to take the ‘least effort approach’ – let nature work for me.”

Surat, India

Chennai could well learn lessons from closer home, too. Surat, a city in the western Indian state of Gujarat, has put in place early flood warning systems to ensure that loss of life is minimised among its teeming population. It has also managed to restore a clogged and polluted lake, and has turned the surrounding area into a public space replete with entertainment and games for children and adults.

“Chennai’s residents will benefit if similar flood warning systems are put in place since this will give them some respite time to move away from the area,” says Kamlesh Yagnik, Surat’s chief resilience officer, who worked with municipal authorities to enable these projects. “Water bodies can also be cleaned and restored using the public-private partnership model, as we did in Surat.”

As the floods have become politically sensitive in the city, and with state elections looming, Chennai’s residents are at a unique juncture to demand a sustainable plan for a more resilient, “blue” city.

“After big disasters there are windows of opportunity,” says Michael Berkowitz, the 100RC president. “People are shaken out of their comfort zones and come out of their silos. We need to use that momentum to create a strong city. The next disaster will not necessarily be a flood – it could also be a tsunami, or a typhoon, or terrorism. Chennai needs to be prepared to face any disaster.”

They said that the Home Secretary told the panel the government is likely to come out with its assessment of losses and measures to deal with it within a fortnight as the Parliamentary committee urged the Centre to give liberal assistance to the rain-ravaged state.



The eight-member team, led by Joint Secretary in the Union Home Ministry T V S N Prasad, had met Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa after touring the state. The Chief Minister asked them to make an ""in-depth assessment"" and submit its report to the Union Home Ministry ""expeditiously"".



Jyalalithaa, who has demanded a Central assistance of Rs 25,912 crore, had told the visiting team that the requirement of funds for relief and restoration of infrastructure ""are well beyond the resources available with the state"".



Following the disaster that claimed about 280 lives, the state government submitted a demand for Rs 25,912 crore. The team had earlier also visited the state and made an assessment of damage last year.



Besides Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Cuddalore, Tirunelveli and Tuticorin districts had bore the brunt of the torrential rains during the North East monsoon last year.



The panel meeting in which representatives from Home Ministry, Finance Ministry, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Tamil Nadu government briefed members about the flash flood and the steps taken in the aftermath, members raised a number of questions on the government's preparedness to meet such a crisis and about the quantum of central assistance.



The members also wanted the Centre to do more in situations saying Centre cannot abdicate its responsibility during such massive disasters.



In the last meeting of the panel on December 18, the Home Secretary had to face the ire of members for leaving the panel's deliberations midway with two TMC MPs even walking out of the committee's meeting, resulting in its postponement.



Following this, chairman of the panel and Congress MP from Rajya Sabha P Bhattacharya called Mehrishi again and advised him not to do so in future.

356,895,chennai,2016,http://scroll.in/article/815821/why-engineering-interventions-wont-prevent-another-flood-in-chennai,7 Sept 2016,Why engineering interventions won’t prevent another flood in Chennai,"In mid-August, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs submitted a trite and shallow report on the December 2015 Chennai floods. Rejecting the Union home secretary's assertion that “there can be no preparation for a disaster that occurs once in 100 years”, the committee found “illegal encroachment” and faulty town planning to be the major causes of the Chennai floods, and recommends the use of “advanced technology to fight it out.”

The committee's report stayed within established comfort zones to view urban floods merely as an engineering and technical problem, requiring engineering and technical interventions. It fails to interrogate the role of non-engineering concepts, such as growth, in increasing the vulnerability of human settlements. It is not as if urban growth is a force of nature; it is a result of economic policies that prioritise the urban over the rural. Can a city like Chennai really be expected to grow eternally without compromising its resilience to cyclones, rains, heat waves and water scarcity? Can growth not be questioned? What if our urban predicament has more to do with notions of value and worthlessness than it does with the integrity of calculations involving rain run-off coefficients, rainfall intensities or the design of stormwater drains?

When meaning changes

The Tamil land classification poromboke has survived since the medieval times. Up until the East India Company arrived in Chennai, the word referred to shared-use areas like groves, waterbodies and their margins, the sea and the seaside, grazing lands, burial grounds and burning ghats, sites for houses in villages, hills, grasslands and village forests. These lands and waters were outside (porom) the revenue register (pokku).

Poromboke areas were not a free-for-all like European commons. Their usage was restricted to certain communities for certain uses at certain times. Fishers, potters, carpenters, toddy tappers, bleachers, palm-frond weavers, cane and bamboo workers, and salt farmers relied on their access to healthy poromboke areas for sustenance and surplus. The oppressive caste system left its mark on the poromboke too. But these were the only areas where even the historically oppressed had clear inalienable rights.

The first connotations of worthlessness were perhaps appended to the poromboke in the early days of property-making by the British East India Company and later by the British crown. In the eyes of the colonial government, poromboke areas yielded no revenue, were outside the property market and hence of lower worth. Today, Poromboke has degraded to mean wasteland although in revenue parlance the latter is an altogether different category called tharisu. In colloquial Tamil usage too, poromboke has become a pejorative referring to places or people that are worthless.

The devil is always in the connotation. Consider the phrase “illegal encroachment” used by the parliamentary committee. Implicit in this fraught phrase is the acknowledgement of legal encroachments, and the normalisation of a notion that what is legal will magically be exempted from causing damage or being damaged by floodwaters. Where the human law is preoccupied with license, nature's law is concerned only with the location.

The word encroachment conjures up images of disorderly hovels constructed by the marginalised on the margins of roads, rivers, canals, lakes and the sea. It never brings up images of glass and steel IT buildings, a world-class airport, a mega port or a railway bridge.

Worth and worthlessness

If the colonial government hinted at certain geographies as areas of low worth, the neoliberal Indian state has extended this notion of worthlessness to encompass entire peoples. The exercise of disaster-proofing a city never engages with the question of how or why the urban poor gravitate towards poromboke areas, why the de-valued people are left to fend for themselves in de-valued spaces.

The vision for the city or nation is not a consensus, but one that is driven by a specific set of interests. Slogans like “world-class city” or “make in India” come with specific ascriptions of value and worthlessness to places and people; they contain plans to re-order the landscape accordingly.

As a baseline, poromboke areas are seen as valueless in such visions, which then set out plans to inject new worth into these areas by converting them to other productive uses – elevated rail over Buckingham Canal's kalvai poromboke, the Elcot Special Economic Zone in Pallikaranai marshland's kazhuveli (floodplain) poromboke, housing and commercial layouts in the Velachery's erstwhile meikal (grazing) poromboke or Adambakkam lake's eri poromboke, or the Chennai airport's extended runway over Adyar's river poromboke.

Chennai's floods are not a result of unplanned development. The city's hydraulic infrastructure has been and is being systematically dismantled. Chennai's second masterplan proposes to double the area under residential land use and increase industrial land-use from 6,563 hectares to 10,690 hectares by 2026. To accommodate this, area under agriculture will be reduced by 42%, and areas under forests, hills and waterbodies will shrink to half the existing 56,000 hectares.

How to avert disaster

An increase in built-up area will increase rain run-off and flooding risks. To compensate this increased run-off, drainage capacities will need to be augmented. But Chennai's masterplan aims to do exactly the reverse, by building on existing drainage systems.

Of the 3,416 hectares allocated to “Special and Hazardous Industries” in the Chennai Metropolitan Area outside Chennai, a little less than 1,000 hectares falls in North Chennai's Ennore region. More than 809 acres of this is wetland – identified as salt pans, fish ponds and creek. The mini-Navaratna Kamarajar Port's financial viability and the success of the celebrated Sagarmala project hinge on creating land where water currently flows. In this decision, the port is seen to yield higher value than the ecosystem dividends of a healthy river. Unmaking the river to Make in India will come with the certain collateral damage of floods in the densely-populated North Chennai region.

Once set in motion, the consequences of such an action cannot be managed by engineering interventions. What is required is a reorientation of our cultural values to avert disaster – the canal, river, mangroves, sand dunes, grasslands and forests need to be valued more than ports, power plants, mines and highways. For North Chennai to be safe, the health of the Ennore creek has to be restored. No further encroachment into the creek's waterspread area should be allowed, even if that means one missing link in the Sagarmala.

The word poromboke and the associated geographies have to be reclaimed and re-infused with the value that it was once associated with. This is not a task only for engineers, but for social scientists, poets, artists, artisans, visionary politicians and cultural activists.

But now it has emerged that as the city expanded, more than 150 water bodies, that were part of a flood mitigating system in the city and its suburbs, were encroached and turned into human habitation. The result was there to see: Plum real estate ventures in Mudichur and Tambaram went under water.According to a study done by CareEarth Trust (a Chennai-based biodiversity research organisation), only 15% of the city's wetlands are left, down from the 80% when Chennai's area was lesser.The researcher, Prem V , has analysed the spatiotemporal variations, specially focussing on wetland and built-up land of the Chennai metropolitan area from 1980 to 2010.As per the findings, the built-up area of the city was 47.62sqkm in 1980, only 20%, while the wetlands were spread over 186.30sqkm (see maps). In 1991, the built-up area increased three-fold, 152.33sqkm, and almost equalled the wetland spread which in the 11 years had come down to 159.41sqkm.The IT boom at the turn of the millennium triggered a construction boom in the southern parts of the city to accommodate offices; and to house techies the real estate business flourished in the vicinity. Over the years, the city expanded and outskirts like OMR and Perungudi transformed. As concrete replaced the shrublands and dry lake beds, the built-up area increased. In 2000, it was 250.58sqkm (68%) when compared to the 117.48sqkm of the wetlands. A decade later, the built-up area touched 402.10sqkm (85%) and the wetlands had shrunk to 71.05sqkm (15%).The study found that most of the water bodies affected were in the southern and western suburbs. The areas where the water bodies were encroached, some institutionally, included Tambaram, Perungalathur, Vandalur, Ramapuram, Manappakkam, Valasaravakkam, Ambattur, Alandur and Adyar. Incidentally, several of these areas were hit hard by the December deluge.According to the study, buffer areas of a lake are the first casualties of rapid urbanisation. Known as odai porambokku and yeri porambokku in Tamil ­ meaning rivulet across a wasteland and lake on a wasteland respectively - these buffer areas connected lakes and drained excess water from one water body into another. These channels formed an integral part of a natural flood mitigating system, but over time, with the lakes dry, these were encroached upon, the study said. Also, pastoral land adjoining the lakes acted as floodplains during monsoon. With the channels and farmlands gone, flooding was imminent.As a conservation-oriented study, the research provides a road map for the government to protect the wetlands from further degradation. Six years ago the Union ministry of environment and forests enacted Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules 2010. One of the key features of this legislation was powers vested in the state machinery to determine the “wise“ use of water bodies. This May, Tamil Nadu set up wetland authority to protect the water bodies.

VICTIMS

SURVIVORS

SAVIOURS

From keeping one's nerves in check while waiting outside bank ATMs to holding tight as furious gusts blew away the city's green cover; from lending a hand to a stranger in need to not following a bloodied path paved by the death of a leader -2016, for Chennai, has been a year of heroism and survival.At the turn of this year, the clouds that had brought more grief than gain had cleared - leaving behind a trail of death, destruction and disbelief.But it also left traces of hope in humanity as it made heroes of many .“Everywhere we looked, there was a hand to help us. It may have been someone who lost his or her own roof or officials going beyond the call of duty ,“ said Surjeet Singh Guleria, DIG, National Disaster Response Force.He should know. NDRF men were on their toes even before the beginning of the year as last December's floods exposed the state machinery's lack of preparedness as much as Chennai's resilience. It became a topic for many a public health and climate change research; a scar on the government and a weapon in the hands of opposition parties.It also haunted many. They tried to exorcise it through the ballot in the assembly elections five months later. Despite the government's assurances, promises and freebies, Chennai voted for change: the ruling AIADMK got only five of the 16 seats in the district as against the 14 seats it bagged in the 2011 election. It was the wind from other districts that saw the AIADMK sail back to power.The ship soon hit rough seas. A familiar storm had come to brew in the form of the long-standing Cauvery dispute after the Supreme Court issued a directive to the Karnataka government to release water to Tamil Nadu . While strikes ensued in the neighbouring state, there was an uneasy calm in TN.“TN's subdued reaction could be due to multiple reasons, including the directive being more in the state's favour,“ political observer Badri Seshadri said. “It could also mean people and parties are coming of age. They see the futility of burning and blocking public utilities.“The dread of a possible outbreak of violence returned when, on September 22, then chief minister J Jayalalithaa was admitted to Apollo Hospitals on Greams Road. Overnight, the hospital was converted into an impregnable for tress. “Emotions were high, ru mours were afloat and the air was tense. We had our men stationed in sensitive areas, but the city surprised us,“ a senior police officer said. But everyone was more sombre than dramatic.While the fate of the state's po litical future lay beyond the hospital's doors, rumbles of a different sort caught people unawares on the night of November 8: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , in a televised address to the nation, declared that all `500 and `1,000 notes would be invalid at the strike of midnight. The move, the government claimed, was to crack down on black money .There was, however, little information on its execution. Lakshmi Vilas Bank deputy manager N Mahalakshmi was among the 15,000 or so bank employees left in the lurch.“We had to plan the logistics, including filling ATMs and transporting money in a few hours,“ said Mahalakshmi, who now takes her four-year-old daughter to office as she has to work well beyond the usual hours.But what overwhelmed her most was watching people, including the old and infirm, patiently waiting to get their money. Bank employees like her put a smile on their tired faces and parroted to people what the PM and the finance minister had said: “It was just a matter of time before the system was smooth again.“ It still is not. Not yet.While the city flocked to banks and ATMs, on December 5, doctors declared the CM dead after cardiac arrest. The state shut again in reverence -and fear of violence.Again, it came as a surprise to many as TN behaved with dignity .“I think they were too shocked to react as they were sure she would return like she always has from dire situations,“ said retired assistant commissioner of police C Inbakumar, who was a trainee subinspector when he led the guncarriage of M G Ramachandran in 1987. “The mob was unruly back then. It was a struggle to contain the violence,“ he recalled.Before the grief died, a cyclone took form near the Andamans ober the Bay of Bengal. Early in the afternoon of December 12, Cyclone Vardah hit Chennai and surrounding areas, felling more than 1 lakh trees and damaging many other properties. The loss was pegged at `6,000 crore.Tamil Nadu has weathered the storm, but it continues to stare at uncertainties over politics and some basic amenities including water supply. A Metrowater official's reply to a question on the water situation the coming summer probably holds good for just about anything: “Bad. But if the past is anything to go by, we will survive.“Though Cyclone Vardah destroyed everything in its path, the biggest casualty was Chennai's green cover, as it uprooted over 1 lakh trees, some as old as 70 years. Anna Nagar, Teynampet and Kodambakkam were among the worst hit. City parks and green lungs such as Guindy National Park and Vandalur Zoo were also totally ravaged.Once lush residential neighbourhoods, in Thiruvanmiyur, Alwarpet and Velachery Road were cut off from the rest of the city as fallen trees blocked the roadsCyclone Vardah left a trail of disaster.But many heritage structures including the Madras high court, Ice House and Senate House along the Marina stood tall though panels of a star hotel in Teynampet were ripped out by the wind. Intach Tamil Nadu convener S Suresh said the Chepauk Palace and stone structures of Mammallapuram withstood the cyclonedue to the strength of their constructionChennaiites rose to the occasion, sparing no effort to help the stricken city.As Vardah struck, NGOs such as Chennai Volunteers, Agni Foundation, Namma Chennai Calling and the Blue Cross of India began coordinating rescue operations. They were joined by residents who helped get medical aid for injured pedestrians, directed traffic and helped corporation workers clear fallen trees",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Chennai Flood Map, an app that visualises the impact of last year’s devastating floods in the city, has been selected for presentation in the Visualising Cities exhibit at the prestigious United Nations Habitat III conference in Quito, Ecuador.

The app was jointly developed by five colleagues at Mapbox, Bangalore, in the last week of November 2015, as torrential rains started hitting Chennai.

Says Aruna Sankaranarayanan, who conceptualised the idea, “Mapbox had their monthly hackathon that weekend. Incidentally, Chennai’s monsoons with severe thunderstorms had battered the city, flooding many parts, so we thought of developing an app based on that.”

The result was Chennai Flood Map, an app that displays an interactive map of the city, and allows anyone to mark a street as flooded. Other users can then visualise the city with the flooded areas marked out. Says Arun Ganesh, interface designer and cartographer for the app, “The app was completed in a day. The affected parts were marked in pink. We posted the link on our respective social media pages.”

However, there were only a few visitors. All that changed as the flooding turned critical in the first week of December 2015. The app went viral on social media and started getting heavy traffic.

Says Arun, “Our personal server couldn’t handle the load, so we roped in Sajjad Anwar and Sanjay Bhangar to scale up the infrastructure.” Says Sanjay, “At peak load, we received 1,500 requests per second. We moved the application to our company’s server and used its technology. Soon, the situation was under control.”

The technology for Chennai Flood Map lies at the intersection of three revolutionary changes. First, since the app allows crowdsourcing, it enables ordinary citizens to contribute their local knowledge to the application. While each citizen might know of the flooding situation only in their locality, by pooling together the knowledge from thousands of citizens, the app is able to piece together the flooding status across the entire city in real time.

What about authenticity of the data? Arun says, “Users were free to mark and update information. Due to the number of users, if someone has entered wrong information, somebody else would correct it. Prasanna Loganathar helped with design visual improvements. We also continuously monitored the feedback.”

The second revolution is the rise of open source mapping technology. Mapping is everywhere in our lives today. Whether it is checking directions or hailing a taxi or locating restaurants nearby, maps have become indispensable. However, writing apps based on maps can be an expensive affair, as you need to purchase them from a map provider.

Open source mapping technology changes all that. Chennai Flood Map used a technology called Open Street Map (OSM). When asked about the reason for using OSM against Google maps, Arun replies, “The data in OSM is completely community-driven. It is free of cost for an enterprising individual to build on top of it, while Google maps has restrictions and is also costly to use in a customised application.” The final revolution, and potentially the most impactful, is the way such apps enable civic participation by ordinary citizens on a massive scale. While it will take a long time for the residents of Chennai to forget the devastating floods, a lasting image of that time is one where the residents of the city came together for rescue efforts. Enabled by the Chennai Flood Map app and coordinated over social media, several teams and NGOs were able to identify high-risk areas, coordinate relief supplies and deliver them to those in need. A very satisfied Aruna says, “We also received great feedback from volunteering groups and NGOs, who told us that it gave them real insight about the affected areas.” What the response to the floods has shown is that citizens are ready to participate in civic issues on a large scale, if they have technology enablers to make it easy.

The app has seen global awareness via social media. Arun wraps up, “We have received many enquiries from universities, research students and technologists from around the world, who are interested in doing similar apps.” They have further plans on the existing link for this year’s monsoon. With 15,000 reports of flooded streets and over a million views, the Chennai Flood Map app has shown how open source mapping technology can be a positive enabler for citizen participation in urban habitats.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
361,900,chennai,2016,http://scroll.in/article/822879/a-year-after-the-deluge-this-chennai-neighbourhood-is-still-living-with-fear-and-loss,1 Dec 2016,"A year after the deluge, this Chennai neighbourhood is still living with fear and loss","At noon on November 16 last year, Dharmaraja ran to the terrace of a three-storeyed building in Samatva Periyar Nagar, a neighbourhood in the southern outskirts of Chennai, frantically waving his red shirt. He was trying to catch the attention of an Indian Coast Guard helicopter circling overhead.

It had been almost 36 hours since the 18-year-old had eaten anything and the hunger was making his head spin. And it was closing in on two days since he and 17 other residents had been trapped in the building, which was partially underwater. The floodwaters were everywhere, making his skin shrivel and the soles of his feet peel.

Fortunately, the helicopter spotted the stranded residents. It dropped a can of water and a carton full of biscuits on to the terrace of what must have looked like the first floor of an isolated building in the suburbs.

“We were later told that from above, nobody could see that an entire neighbourhood of 150 huts had submerged under more than 20 feet of water,” said Dharmaraja.

Caught unawares

In 2015, the Tamil Nadu capital experienced the heaviest rainfall in a hundred years, resulting in overflowing lakes and canals that flooded thousands of homes. With encroachments and illegal buildings choking Chennai’s waterways and its river mouths clogged with sewage and silt, the city’s drainage system fell apart under the impact.

Then, on December 2, after a fortnight of heavy rain, the Chembarambakkam dam was opened in the early hours of the morning to reduce the dangerously high water levels. This instantly flooded large parts of the city. The residents of Samatva Periyar Nagar call this the “second flood”.

A year later, they still remember it as they do that Sunday morning in November, when the floodwaters caught them unawares for the first time, destroying almost all their possessions and claiming three lives in the neighbourhood.

“If such a disaster strikes us again, none of us will be able to cope with it – physically, financially or emotionally,” said A Amudha, a resident.

Samatva Periyar Nagar came into existence only six years ago. It is located on the banks of the Adyar river, which looks to be little more than a stream here. But in the monsoon, the water level rises to become knee-deep, the residents said.

Most of the people here earlier lived in a slum off the arterial Poonamallee High Road in North-West Chennai and were relocated as part of a road development project.

“Had we continued to live there, we would not have been affected by the floods,” said Dharmaraja. “Only last year, we got to know that this place where we were relocated is actually a floodplain.”

Residents said the floodwaters rose to the height of the electricity poles.

A deluge of memories

The neighbourhood still carries the scars of the flood, of loved ones lost and homes and possessions destroyed.

Outside a straw hut covered in tarpaulin sheets, B Balamma crouches over heated coal blocks, blowing at them through a metal tube while keeping an eye on her three-year-old son. This was not always Balamma’s home. In fact, it belongs to her brother. A little over a year ago, she had her own house two streets away, where she lived with her husband and three sons. The couple were contract workers with a private garbage collection company.

“On November 15 [2015], it was raining heavily, the water started to rise and we left our house,” she said. “Later, we could not see our house anymore. We never thought there would be so much water.”

Balamma and her family took shelter in a nearby school with the rest of their neighbours. But Bhimarao, her husband, decided to go back to the flooded neighbourhood to help his two disabled sisters, who had not yet made it out.

“He swam a certain distance and took shelter for a while,” Balamma said, tears welling up in her eyes. “But maybe he couldn’t swim anymore, because his swollen body was found the next day by a rescue team.”

After Bhimarao’s death, Balamma received Rs 4 lakhs from the government that she turned into fixed deposits for each of her three sons. “But how can that make up for my husband being dead?” she asked.

Struggling to support her children on a meagre income of Rs 200 a day, Balamma has sent her two older boys, aged seven and five, to her native village in Andhra Pradesh. But none of them go to school. “I was not sure if they would remain in Andhra Pradesh or come back to Tamil Nadu, so I did not admit them in school,” she said.

Picking up the pieces

After the floods, the road to recovery has been an arduous one. “When we opened the door to our house, we were knee-deep in muck,” recalled Dharmaraja. “We had to scoop it all out little by little. For many days, we could not lie down or sleep because the floor was damp. We had to sit up and rest.”

S Sundari, who lives alone, had to pump out several buckets of water every day to clean her house. “My joints became so sore that I was advised to undergo an operation,” she said. “But thankfully, I got better with medicine and rest.”

Sundari is thankful for more than that. Her sewing machine, which was her only means of earning a livelihood, was destroyed in the floods. But with the help of the non-profit Arappor Iyakkam, Sundari found a donor in Coimbatore who provided her with a power sewing machine worth Rs 30,000.

Like her, other residents have not forgotten the acts of kindness of strangers who helped rebuild their homes and provided them with essentials when they had none.

“We lost everything in the flood,” said S Jaiseelee, an anganwadi teacher. “Till today, we are running our households with the bedsheets, utensils and clothes given to us as relief material.”

After the floods, the Tamil Nadu government announced that every affected family would be given Rs 5,000 as compensation. But many residents of Samatva Periyar Nagar said they were yet to receive this amount.

“Many of us lost all our documents and papers,” said Amudha. “How were we supposed to fill up any of the forms [for compensation] or even search for our bank account numbers?”

Risk remains

A few months ago, regional news channels in the state predicted that the North-East (October-December) monsoon this year would bring heavier rain than it did last year, filling the residents of Samatva Periyar Nagar with dread. But, to their relief, there was hardly any rain in November.

However, the residents have not yet dropped their guard completely as they are worried about the flood preparations carried out by civic bodies.

Two months ago, the Arappor Iyakkam had organised a public hearing where 20 residents had voiced their concern about the flood risk to their neighbourhood. To their delight, the very next week, the Public Works Department had started desilting the part of the Adyar river flowing through the area, so that the floodwaters could drain into it safely. However, at the same time, department officials also ordered the digging up of smaller channels that, according to the residents, would direct the course of the floodwaters towards Samatva Periyar Nagar.

The Public Works Department has dug up small channels that Dharmaraja said would make his neighbourhood flood again.

“This does not seem to have been done with any kind of planning, about how the water can be drained into the river,” said Dharmaraja. “This puts our lives at risk once again.”

For now, the residents are learning to live with the trauma of last year’s flood disaster and worries about the future. “Sometimes, while sleeping, you are still struck with fear,” Dharmaraja said. “Will the water suddenly come into our homes again?”

He added that a lot of people asked him how it had felt to be in that situation. “But only if you experience it at that moment will you understand how it felt,” he said. “Only if you were there would you understand the fear and pain.”",flood,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","November 15, 2015","December 2, 2015",Chennai,494 mm,"Rs 10,000 crore",464,18.7 lakh people were affected,"The floods were caused by the heaviest rainfall in a hundred years, resulting in overflowing lakes and canals that flooded thousands of homes.

The South Indian floods occurred in November-December 2015. Besides wreaking havoc in lives of the people, it also took a toll upon the economy of the states. One of the worst impacts was on the automobile industry, which is still recuperating from this natural catastrophe. Thousands of affected car owners, insurance companies, bankers and dealers are now sending selling request of their flood-hit cars. These cars often range from hatchbacks to luxury sedans and SUVs.

Copart India PVT LTD, subsidiary of the US-based auctioneer currently has piles of flood-hit cars at its Sriperumbudur yard and more counting with each passing day. Mr. Rajeev Kapoor, Managing Director, Copart, said that the cars are being auctioned off as low as ten times of their on-road price. He further stated that cars as new as 2015 models are being sold off at a throwaway prices.

On Wednesday auction, cars like Audi A4 series were available at Rs. 3.4 lac against the actual price range of Rs. 33.5 lac-Rs. 41.7 lac (ex-showroom, Chennai). Similarly, the BMW 3-Series sedan is available at Rs. 6 lac against the current model price range of Rs. 35.5 - 44.7 Lac (ex-showroom, Chennai). Further, the 2012 Porsche Cayenne model is available at base price of mere Rs. 5 lac.

Company has also made it crystal clear that they are only auctioning the cars and the required documents, they are not responsible for the condition and repair of the car. Last week, the online auction portal received 10 cars on a daily basis. The interested buyers are registering with refundable security amount on the website.

Other auction portals like Select Auto Mart has about 10,000 flood-hit cars put on sale, out of which around 5,000 have been auctioned in mere 20 days.

Skymet Weather Team

It has been a year since the Chennai deluge took place. On this day, last year, the roads of Chennai were submerged in water. Chennai rains were wreaking havoc over the city. Residents were reeling under flooding rains and were praying for the deluge to come to an end.

Chennai was not the same as it was. Transport services were completely shut down. Ola boats were introduced, schools were closed, startup organizations had come into play helping people in every way they could.

Not only this, the NDRF, NDMA and the Indian Armed Forces along with the Indian Navy and the Indian Forces were in full force in carrying out rescue and relief operations. The city had received more than 270 mm of rainfall in a mere 24 hours, breaking a century-old record.

Flight services were shut down for days, office goers were asked to work from as offices were flooded along with almost all roads of Chennai. Several lives were lost and a disaster was declared in the capital city of Tamil Nadu and its adjoining areas.

While Chennaites have gotten over the devastating floods in a year. However, this is a tragedy that they will never forgive and scars will remain there to haunt them. Every time it rains heavily in Chennai, residents will be reminded of the first few days of December. It is the December they will never forget.

“This is not about one man or a hero saving hundreds of people. This story is about human bonding and how it evolves against the backdrop of an incident of this scale,” she said.

Lakshmy was inspired to make this film after getting intrigued by real-life experiences that she heard from close family members and people from different walks of life.

The project will be facilitated by high-end visual effects (VFX) work.

A group of civil and structural engineers give probable solutions and talk about the lessons learnt from the Chennai floods.

After the recent floods, most Chennaites have undergone the experience of living in an unplanned city. As the city grew, it occupied most of the water bodies. Though we cant change the plan of the city, here are some ways in which we can make the city ready for any eventuality due to incessant rain. We have made technical and non-technical solutions. We want to gather civil engineers and other like-minded people to be a part of them team and find the best solutions. This is an initiation to go further and make Chennai a flood-proof city in the future.

Here are the technical solutions

1. Improve flood water disposal system

The present drainage system is not designed for the sheer size of the population. Therefore, in case of heavy incessant rains, the drainage pipes do not have the capacity to dispose all rain water in a short time. We suggest the disposal of flood water by separate storm water lines or existing drainage lines with automatic pumps. Most people are not aware that they are staying in low-lying areas. Our solution is to keep boards with ground elevation with respect to nearest water bodies at all important places.

2. Construct retaining walls and use sandbags

During the recent floods, most deaths happened due to the lack of time to escape from the flood water. There should be a temporary remedy to give time to people to safeguard themselves and their belongings. Identify a row of houses as shown in the first picture and make use of a retaining wall. The space in between can be filled with sand bags to arrest water. Construct additional temporary retaining walls just next to the reservoir gates using rapid hardening cement within hours of incessant rain.

3. Release water from reservoir after studying areas

The authorities are not aware that the actual situation arises due to release of water. Hence, the contour of the total city beyond water bodies in 3-D form needs to be studied.

Here are the non-technical solutions to the problems we faced.

1. Identify vendors to supply food

Photo source: Facebook

Drinking water, milk, and bread was sold at Rs. 100 to Rs. 200 during the flood. The solution is for the government to identify possible vendors and provide logistics support to them. So that they can sell these essential food items at MRP.

2. Repair potholes on the roads

Photo source: Facebook

Some potholes are so big that vehicles may tilt while negotiating the road. Allocating funds, calling tenders, and finalising the lowest bidder is time consuming. The authorities can minimise the time taken to complete these works by creating a separate fund and ensuring works are completed on a war footing. To ensure quality of work, help may be sought from local NGOs. There should also be signages warning people about manholes ahead.

3. Select media to communicate emergency news

There were a lot of rumors three days before the floods about the release of water. It is important to select some of the media channels to communicate vital information during the floods about rescue work, supply of food, etc.

4. Encourage use of solar power

Photo source: Facebook

There was no power supply as all power cable boxes were water logged and this could have caused short circuit. People were not able to communicate with others as their phones ran out of charge. The use of solar power could have prevented this problem. People must install at least 1 kW solar power panels, especially in houses situated in low lying areas. People must also use remote batteries to charge their phones.

5. Operate public transport services

Photo source: Facebook

There was no access to public transport for nearly a week in a few places. This made individuals venture out with their own vehicle. This is dangerous as smaller vehicles find it difficult to negotiate manholes, drains, etc. We suggest that public transport services must be operated, even if the route is 50 per cent clear.

6. Insist on single-point coordination for volunteers

Photo source: Facebook

Some people got food more than once and the support of more volunteers. This can be solved by ensuring single-point coordination. There should be area-wise division of volunteers and helplines need to be popularised.

7. Create a cleaning force for garbage removal

Photo source: Facebook

A cleaning force must be in place. It should be ready to attend to emergencies from the nearest city.

Fallen trees and branches that had been flung across arterial roads now lay in clumps along the pavements. Outside residences and offices on Wednesday, leaves, twigs and shards of glass were being swept and piled into garbage bins.



On Monday afternoon, Cyclone Vardah hit the coast of North Chennai near Pulicat with wind speeds reaching up to 110-120 kmph. As citizens huddled indoors, powerful gusts of wind wrecked havoc not only along the coastal city but also in the interior parts of Chennai’s neighbouring districts of Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur. Settlements built with aluminium and asbestos sheets have been ripped apart by the cyclonic storm, causing many poor families to return to damaged homes the next day.

Still no power

For more than 24 hours since, the city had no power. With hardly any cash in hand and the inability to make electronic transactions, the morning after the cyclone was saw citizens with inadequate food and necessary supplies.



By Tuesday night, power was restored to many parts of the city. The Times of India reported that power has been restored to around 60% of the city, but might take two more days for power supply to reach the suburbs.

In a suburban residential area in South Chennai, residents have been repeatedly calling the Chennai Corporation for assistance to remove trees and branches that have fallen across the street. There has been no power here for more than 48 hours.



“The initial response we got from them was that they will concentrate on the main roads, and come here after completing that,” said Anand, a resident of Thoraipakkam.



The residents had to make arrangements to move the trees themselves.



“We needed to clear the trees to allow sewage trucks to empty out the Sewage Treatment Plants in the apartments down the street,” said P Rajan, another resident. “The STPs were close to overflowing.”



In parts of North Chennai too, residents complained that they haven’t had access to water since Monday evening.



“We went to the corporation office. They said they will supply water by tankers,” said Sarala from Tondiarpet, who works as a domestic help.



Lakshmi, another domestic help in Royapettah, said that without electricity, groundwater could not be extracted. “Now we don’t have any water for the entire apartment,” she added.

Unprepared for strong winds

While citizens are still trying to bring order to their lives, it is clear that the corporation did not anticipate the kind of damage that Cyclone Vardah has caused.

A corporation official told Scroll.in that they did not have enough electric saws and other equipment to take care of such huge number of uprooted trees. Consequently, tools had to be brought in from neighbouring districts. The Times of India reported that 1750 workers, 60 earth movers, 200 trucks and 250 power saws were mobilised from panchayats and municipalities surrounding Chennai.

While the Chennai Corporation had made arrangements to prevent flooding, little had been done to prevent damage caused by high-speed winds. Water drained quickly enough in many areas that had been flooded last year, but the prolonged power cut remains a problem.

Electricity board officials said many parts of Chennai still did not have power largely because uprooted trees that had fallen on transmission lines, damaging them severely.

The battle against the Tirumazhisai township has been long drawn for the villagers of Kuthambakkam, Vellavedu, Parvatharajapuram, Narasingapuram, and Chembarambakkam.

“In truth, this is the second time the project has come up. We have been opposing this for a very long time, since its inception during the DMK regime,” explains R.Elango, former president, Kuthambakkam Village Panchayat. “The main reason for that is that this is the natural flood plain and has a natural gradient that allows water from 22 water bodies to drain into the Nemam and Chembarambakkam reservoirs. This year, there were sheets of water flowing in heavy current, even swamping the nearby national highway (to Bengaluru).”

He goes on to describe the possible consequences of locating an entire township on this plain. “We have spoken to geologists and water experts, the natural consequence of blocking the water course will be, in case of a repeat of the December floods, the devastation of the town of Tirumazhisai will be complete. He further explains, “Since water won’t have any space to flow, it will spill over into the Couum, and in its fury drown the north of Chennai. It will not be a gentle or rapid rise in water levels as the city witnessed during these rains; it will be like a river, with the force of a tsunami wave that will brook no hurdles in its progress to the sea.”

Interestingly, the government has been aware that it is acquiring land in a water course region. In 2011, the Tashildar of Poonamallee writes to the Chief Engineer, PWD, Kosasthalayar River Basin, requesting the department to issue a no-objection certificate to enable the TNHB to alienate 5.12 acres of “water-course poromboke lands” in the five villages. Those regions are all classified as “odai” (stream), “vaikkal” (canal), “maduvankarai” (embankment) and PWD “kalvai” (canal).

The TNHB assured the villagers that it would build a 100 m channel for flood run off, but the experience of December has showed that that such a canal will be completely incapable of handling any serious flood.

Villagers, largely paddy farmers, from the five villages have come together to oppose the project. “We even went to the National Green Tribunal, but at that time, there was no real proof, just our theories. Even today, so many days after the floods, there is all the proof, right in front of our eyes. It is dangerous to build the township there, the authorities must come and see for themselves, ” says C.Bhaskar, a farmer from Tirumazhisai.

Another farmer from the neighbouring Kuthambakkam, V. Venkateswarulu says there were recent attempts to begin filling up the area. “A contractor started filling up the area acquired by the government just a few days before the rains started. Most of it was washed away with the flood waters, but you can still see some sandy patches from when they filled up the area.” Indeed, there is a sand lick in the middle of the water that still floods the farmlands off Tirumazhisai.

The run off area has been so beautifully designed, or rather the villages built around it, that only the farmlands are affected, and none of the villages that fall in the path, the villagers say. “This is a natural advantage and we need to preserve this,” Mr. Elango adds. “29,000 cusecs went through this terrain easily because it was flat. If there were buildings in the area, the devastation would have been worse.”

Three crops (of paddy) are cultivated in this fertile region that has ample water for irrigation. While the township will take away this source of grains, the crucial issue is that the locals in the area have seen equally bad flooding in the past.

Thandavamoorthy, probably the oldest farmer in the collective, says with authority, that in 1979, there was four feet of water in Kuthambakkam village. “Every one says this was a 100-year record rainfall, but this time we had only two feet of water running through part of the village. We were not overawed by this flood, I’m 33, and even I have seen such water thrice; we know where to cut the road to get the water to flow out,” adds Kamala Kannan, a young BSc graduate who has opted to take up his family trade of agriculture.

S. Janakarajan, professor at the Madras Institute of Development Studies and water expert, says, “You cannot build structures within 500 metres of the river on both sides. This is the buffer zone, the flood plain.” However, he points out that the world over, cities as they grow, have occupied flood plains. “But these countries have learnt the lessons after one or two floods. Building over a flood plain is mindless activity.”

“If you fill up a low-lying area, water will have to go elsewhere — it is common sense. If upstream flood plains are occupied, the water diverts to the city — there is no ambiguity in that. To know this and go ahead, would be irresponsibility on the part of the government, and will sow the seeds of disasters for the future,” he adds.

""The land is not part of any water body, nor had they encroached on water channels. There is a mix of both wet (nanjai) and dry (punjai) lands."" The problem occurred due to unprecedented rainfall over three spells – in early and middle of November and first week of December. Areas around Chembarambakkam recorded over 45 centimetres of rainfall in just a day, sources add. ""The worst case of water stagnation had already been taken into account and a retaining wall will be constructed. Nevertheless, the board has now taken up detailed studies once again to incorporate all safety measures into the project design in the event of a similar flood.""

Sidco Nagar was one of the worst-affected areas during the floods in the city caused by torrential rains in November and December.

The residential area and the adjoining Sidco Industrial Estate were built on the erstwhile Konnur Lake. As is the case with any natural reservoir, the lake was in a low-lying area, which acts as a collection point for water from surrounding neighbourhoods.

“But the housing board selected this [lake area] for the housing purposes,” said PA Chittibabu, general secretary of Sidco Nagar for 30 years now. “We have constructed over 4,000 houses, so now there is no water body here. But during the floods, we suffered for up to 20 days.”

However, with less than three months to go before the receding North East monsoon, when Chennai gets the bulk of its rainfall, the city is in no way better prepared to tackle heavy rains.

Who cares about water bodies?

The water body that Sidco Nagar and other development projects swallowed up was spread across 250 acres, according to a social audit report released in early August by Arappor Iyakkam, an NGO in Chennai. One glance of the 1972 Survey of India map is enough to validate that.

Today, the lake covers just 20 acres. But the Chennai’s urban planning authority does not even recognise that much in its master plan of the city’s development – instead, it has termed the entire area as an institutional plot, paving the way for further development on whatever is left of the lake. A metro project, for instance, came up here in 2013.

The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority’s plan, prepared in 2008, is a blueprint for the city’s development till 2026. It chalks out the land use for the entire city – which areas can be used for industrial development, as institutions, residential complexes, agriculture, water bodies and so on. Accordingly, licences for construction are provided by the government authorities.

In the map below, the horizontal red lines indicate institutional land in the city, which includes the area occupied by Konnur Lake.

The Konnur Lake is not the only water body that has gone unnoticed by the urban planning body. The Ennore Creek, a swamp-like backwater in North Chennai with the tidal mudflats, marshes and fishing villages, now also houses large petrochemical industries that are unrestrained in dumping toxic fly ash and chemical-ridden water in and around the river.

By deeming the Ennore Creek a zone for hazardous industries and the Konnur Lake for institutional development – both places were deluged during the December floods – the urban planning authorities have clearly not taken existing hydrology and ecological sensitivity of the areas into question while planning the city’s growth.

In fact, nearly 90% of the area reserved for Special and Hazardous Industries by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority in Ennore Creek reportedly constitutes salt pans, fish farms and tidal water bodies that fall under Coastal Regulation Zones. These wetlands are crucial as they are natural sponges that prevent flooding by soaking up surface water, rain water and floodwaters, apart from hosting a diverse ecosystem.

Mind the gaps

In June 2016, the Citizen Consumer and Civic Action Group of Chennai filed an RTI plea asking the urban planning authorities if the master plan had taken into account the complete list of water bodies in the city.

The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority responded saying: “The water bodies indicated…is not the complete ones in the Chennai metropolitan Area. As the Master Plan is a Broad Brush zoning map, small narrow water bodies may fall into land uses of agriculture, industrial, institutional etc.”

The urban planning body said that they do not have a list of all water bodies in Chennai.

The master plan is based on maps belonging to the revenue department. The tehsildar, or the local administrator, however, has a different set of maps, which include more minute details of the topography in that particular area.

In its response to the RTI plea, the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority admitted that it does not have the kind of details on its map that the tehsildar does, but says that “such accuracy is not required in the master plan. There is no plan to incorporate and integrate the information.”

Activist Nityanand Jayaraman said that a master plan, by definition, must bring together various data sets and sources to come up with detailed development plans. If this has not been done, he said, it is worthless and can do more damage than good.

“By stating that the master plan authors did not have access to data about water bodies, the RTI shows that the master plan has not been designed with hydrology as a concern,” Jayaraman said. “Chennai's master plan appears to be a sham, and a blueprint for filling the pockets of corrupt administrations and revenue officials along the chain.”

Ideally, the master plan should be drafted after carefully examining the existing use of each part of the city, before opening it up for industrial or development activity.

So how did Konnur Lake lose its status as a water body?

Powerful tehsildars

For reclassifying land or water bodies – changing their land use in the master plan – the approval of the tehsildar is required, except when there is a direct order from the government.

After the floods, the Chennai Municipal Development Authority introduced the rule that a builder must provide a certificate from the tehsildar stating that construction is not being carried out on a water body.

In the RTI reply, the urban planning authority said that information provided by the tehsildar is not verified, because with incomplete maps, they do not have the means to do so.

In other words, if the builder produces a certificate from the tehsildar stating that there is no water body on a site where they propose construction, the urban planning body does not cross-check the claim.

“Some of the information is with the tehsildar’s office and some with the state revenue department,” said Tara Murali, an architect. “In today’s age of digitisation, why can’t the tehsildar’s information be integrated into the master plan?”

Small Steps

Eight months after the heaviest rainfall recorded in 100 years in Chennai flooded large parts of the city, killing more than 300, damaging property worth several thousand crores and leaving thousands stranded at home without electricity, food or drinking water, the citizens of Chennai are restless. With the monsoons fast approaching, there is grave concern over the rivers filled with silt, dysfunctional canals that are meant to pump out rainwater and relentless encroachment on water bodies.

The Chennai Municipal Development Authority now requires each project to have an indication of the prevailing flood line – the highest level up to which water rises in the monsoons – and take all necessary precautions in the design of basements, said Durganand Balsavar, the principal architect of Artes-Human Settlements Development Collaborative in the city, who also works with the Master Plan Committee.

But with the urban planning authority’s unwillingness to take note of smaller waterways and channels, the prospect of another disaster this year looms large.

“We get little bit of information that something is being desilted or something else is being cleared,” said Murali, “But there is no cohesive policy and nobody has identified the various problems or which department is going to plan and execute a strategy for flood prevention. For all I know, this year if we have a similar amount of rainfall, we may again lose many lives.”",issue,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, India",12 November 2015,5 December 2015,Chennai,"1,044 mm","Rs. 10,000 crore",300,"Thousands of people were stranded at home without electricity, food or drinking water",The floods were caused by the heaviest rainfall recorded in 100 years in Chennai,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

When the Chennai floods ravaged the southern Indian state, Aruna came upon the idea to design an interactive app to help people update the status of their locality on it. The ""Chennai Flood Map"" is among the five projects selected by the United Nations across the world that has ""amazed by the way the winning entries took on tough ecological and social challenges something we’ve seen across developed and developing countries"" according to a statement released by the United Nations on Monday.

The app will be part of a presentation in the Visualising Cities exhibit at the prestigious United Nations Habitat III conference in Quito, Ecuador.

Mapbox

Speaking to Indiatimes in an exclusive interview, Aruna Sankaranarayanan says, ""I had no idea that it would be so huge. My teammate and I designed the app and put it out in the public domain. It was picked by so many NGOs and we received so many distress calls on the app, we didn't know what to do."" Her teammate went on to help forward all the distress message to respective NGOs and the app that was meant to provide just information helped in saving many lives and provide much-needed relief materials to thousands.

""It took us about two days to design and put out the app. Most of our work was cut out for us. The app was built entirely using open source software powered by Mapbox,""shares Aruna.

""This is the first time that a project I have managed has become this big. I have only worked on some small side projects for so long. I never imagined the impact of this app. I like to do my work well without thinking too much about how it will be received.""

Mapbox

Apart from her passion for software designing, Aruna also is in love with Indian classical music and has been reaching out to many artists to help her with an app that will make Indian classical music more accessible. ""I like to use technology for something that will impact people. Being trained in classical music, I have been working on a small project that will help make the music more accessible by all.""

Aruna feels that the people she met during her initial years through an open source project are the most significant contributors to her work. ""I don't feel as strongly about the people I met or learnt in college but the people from the Open Source Project have had a great impact on my life and learning.""

After the floods, Chennaiites are now raising their houses in an attempt to be safe from another possible disaster.

A closer look reveals the ingenuity of it. Rows of 'jacks' ­ like the ones used to lift lorries and change their punctured tyres ­ seem to be holding the house up. The labourers have literally lifted the house. They lay rows of concrete bricks to fill up the gaps and increase the height of the house permanently .In Chennai, several contractors offer these services. ""Post floods, we have been inundated with enquiries. We are currently working on seven projects and are fully booked till July,"" said Rishikanth from Mamchand & Sons, based in Haryana.

Classified by insurance firms as “damaged vehicles” beyond repairs, auctioneers are putting up for sale some 10,000 vehicles at cut-price rates. Auction site copart.in has lined up a motley mix of cars at Kora Truck Park on the Chennai-Bangalore highway that were salvaged from the floods.

Chief operating officer of cardekho.com’s auctions division Abhishek Gautam said an Audi A4 manufactured in 2011 fetched as little as Rs 3 lakh. Several high-end models, such as the Porsche sports coupe, have sold for anything between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh.

The bargain price of these cars depends on their make, year of manufacturing and the extent of damage the floods have caused. An auctioneer said it is possible to get a high-end luxury model at 40% of the ex-showroom price. Bargain-hunters were thronging these auctions from far and wide with a firm faith in their mechanic or workshop to bring these almost-junks back to life.

“It is a chance I am willing to take,” said S Venkat, a businessman from Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh looking for a Mahindra XUV 500 at the Copart Yard on Wednesday.

A gleaming silver grey machine caught his fancy and he was willing to go up to Rs 8.5 lakh. But within seconds, the online bid for the SUV touched Rs 9.5 lakh — way beyond his budget.

A disappointed Venkat said: “See there is not a drop of water or trace of rust anywhere inside the vehicle or in the engine. And it is almost brand new, which costs Rs 17 lakh.” According to a rough estimate of insurance claims filed by customers, the number of damaged cars could be around 30,000. Of these, at least 10,000 are classified majorly damaged or beyond repairs.

They are: What are the chances of the disaster repeating? What are the geographical insights we derive? Could such big problems be solved properly? And, finally, what are the implications of the crisis on real estate?

Between 1901 and 2010, October-December accounted for 57 per cent of Chennai’s annual rainfall. Over these decades, population, vehicle count, infrastructure, temperature, and rainfall increased manifold.

So what is Chennai’s rainfall disaster formula? Two days’ rain between October and December should equal 38 per cent of annual rain even if spaced 15 days apart. The contribution of October-December rains has spiked to 63 per cent, 68 per cent, 74 per cent, 80 per cent and even 85 per cent of annual rain every three, four, 4½, 7¾ and 14¼ years, respectively.

Sadly, Chennai is severely deprived of drinking water despite frequent, heavy rain. Regretfully, its lake managers are attuned only to managing drinking water shortage. The Chembarambakkam lake authorities felt compelled to release water when its water tank became 86 per cent full. Included within this 86 per cent was 40 per cent silt. Had the tank been periodically de-silted water discharge could have been avoided.

Chennai’s estimated losses from the floods were 4.5 per cent of its GDP. In 2014-15 Tamil Nadu’s economy impressively grew 14.34 per cent by borrowing heavily. Now, it needs to borrow more to fix the flood’s after-effects.

Geographical insights

Since Chennai’s average height above sea level is 22 feet, any plot of land below that is probably low-lying. The height of the residence should always be higher than the height of the road. Avoid plots on lakes, river beds, lake banks or river banks. Chennai has three types of soil — sandy, clayey and rocky.

In terms of stormwater drainage sandy areas are technically, financially and operationally the simplest requiring mainly good wells. Clayey areas need only good tanks. Rocky localities require extremely costly and technically well-designed stormwater drains. Wells are the cheapest, tanks slightly costlier, drains the costliest. The worst rocky areas are located next to spoilt marshlands or flood plains ( kazhiveli ) and water bodies. The worst floods have occurred in such areas. Real estate’s biggest irony is that the most unsafe rocky areas are also the costliest!

The CMDA lists 12 per cent of areas (by number) as flood-prone. Which means around a fifth of Chennai’s residential areas are low-lying. Stormwater drains have lagged 40 years behind required capacity.

Chennai’s biggest source of drinking water (Chembarambakkam) and its biggest water drainage outlet which drains water into the sea (Adyar River) are geographically adjacent. This needs to be corrected. Rather than being one big Adyar river, could it be split into more tributaries for quicker drainage and easier cleaning? Adyar also suffers several illegal inlets for sewage drainage and storm water.

Have all the city’s lakes been battered by rain or mismanaged by civic authorities? No. There is no correlation between the size of the lake and the extent of flooding. Thaiyur lake (Kelambakkam) burst in 2005 when the rain was lesser, but not in 2015 when rains were heavier. Some lakes have been well managed while others have not.

Lakes whose base and banks were encroached upon created havoc. This time, the State’s second largest manmade lake at Madhuranthakam, which was was not encroached, did not pose problems.

Agricultural scientist MS Swaminathan once said Chennai could experience a sea level rise of 1 metre by 2020. This would make flooding many times worse than 2015. So, going forward, the government needs to quickly decide the new plinth level in constructions; how much depth piling should be done and what the elevation should be.

Chennai is India’s fourth largest city by economy at 3 per cent of the country’s GDP and has 60 per cent of Tamil Nadu’s manufacturing within its 150-km radius. It’s India’s second largest cargo port, caters to 60 per cent of the country’s automotive exports, 30 per cent market share of India’s automobile industry, and 35 per cent market share of its auto components.

Chennai attracts 45 per cent of all overseas health tourists coming to India, around 35 per cent of domestic health tourists and issued the third largest number of visas on arrival in 2014. It is one of the four Indian cities connected globally by undersea fibre-optic cables, a landing point of major submarine telecommunication cable networks and hosts India’s second largest film industry.

Chennai is too big to fail; too important to be neglected. Corporates (especially and including IT sector) have recognised this and contributed hugely to relief funds and works, which are still on. It is both irony and a blessing to the Chennai-ite that such iconic corporates are located in flood-prone zones.

The 2015 rains have also cleaned portions of drainage systems (Adyar and Cooum) saving civic authorities years of time and tons of money! The rains in 2015 have left us with pains, gains, insights and a good future.

As one travels through the various flood-prone parts of Chennai, it becomes evident that the devastating flood of last December is still fresh in people's mind. What worries them most is the apprehension of a similar ordeal this year. The answers to their questions lie with the Public Works department and the Chennai Corporation who are primarily responsible for the macro and micro drainage systems of the city.Last year's flood could be termed as a result of the government's inability to chalk out plans for the maintenance of the city's tanks and channels over the last several years.The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)'s audit report of the economic sector of the public works department (tabled in TN assembly in 2014) also pointed at the failures of the government in implementing flood prevention programmes and maintaining water-bodies.Under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, the central and state governments together had allocated Rs 1,479 crore for macro and micro drainage mechanisms for Chennai in 2009. Of the total, only Rs 633 crore was allocated for major drainages through the PWD while the rest was allocated for storm-water drains through the corporation. ""The objective of the scheme formulated as envisaged in the 11th five year plan to avoid flooding in Chennai remained unachieved even after incurring an expenditure of Rs 394.53 crores until September 2013,"" the report read.The report also mentioned that three out of the 10 flood-prevention packages were not even started while the completion of the rest looked remote in the near future.We can see a direct correlation between the non-completion of projects and the flooded areas. Many projects on south Buckingham Canal hang fire, including the widening of the Okkiyam Madavu belt which remains unfinished for a 5.4km stretch. The CAG observed that this is the reason why flood relief and minimisation of inundation period for the flood affected areas of Velachery, Pallikaranai and Madipakkam remained unachieved.Now with the flood taking a major toll on the city , the question is how prepared are we to face another calamity of a similar nature. Preliminary research carried out by our team (Arappor Iyakkam) shows there has been very little effort on the ground. For instance, the Mugalivakkam canal that joins the Adyar river near DLF has lost its width greatly over the years. With dense vegetation, garbage and silt formation chocking up its course, it won't be a surprise to see a recap of 2015.As experts say, Chennai is a delta with low altitude and it is only through this region that large streams of water from Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur and Chennai will drain into the sea during floods . But, if utilised properly, this could be a wonderful opportunity to recharge groundwater and store enough of it in the tanks. But, without addressing problems like dumping of garbage on water bodies, indiscriminate development of buildings on them and de-silting and reclaiming canals and tanks, the issue cannot be resolved.Except for its plan to desilt large tanks like Chembarampakkam, the PWD department has not informed the public if there is any plan for desilting and widening of the waterways connecting to the rivers.It is high time citizens demanded the PWD and corporation to publish all details of the work to be carried out before monsoon, carry social audits on them, pressure them to de-silt important waterways and fix accountability.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
377,916,chennai,2016,https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/apr/21/india-drought-flooding-natural-disasters-risk-population-economy-insurance,21 Apr 2016,India crippled by extreme weather as 100 million exposed to floods,"High temperatures and a crippling shortage of rainfall in India is forcing schools to close and communities to ration drinking water. In Chennai, the oppressive heat currently gripping the southern Indian city has led to workers demanding an allowance for working in stifling factories and vets offering advice on caring for pets to avoid dehydration. “While some rains would have been a blessing in disguise, the rain gods have ditched Chennai,” writes a reporter for Skymet, which provides weather forecasts in India.

It would have been hard to imagine such a situation four-and-a-half months ago. Following the heaviest rainfall in more than a century at the end of last November, the Adyar river – which runs through the centre of Chennai – surged, causing muddy water to pour over the walls of nearby apartment blocks and into the streets. Thousands were forced to flee their homes, and hundreds died.

Businesses were also affected. Factories such as those of Ford and Renault-Nissan were closed, Chennai International airport suspended operations, power supplies were down and roads across the region became waterlogged, limiting the movement of goods and employees. Reinsurance company Swiss Re estimates the floods caused economic losses of $2.2bn (£1.53bn).

Despite high levels of economic growth, India lags significantly behind countries such as the US and China in building resilience to natural hazards, which cost it $9.8bn a year. This is the conclusion of risk analysis company Verisk Maplecroft, whose latest hazard risk indices have ranked India’s population first in a list of those most exposed to natural hazards.

The research identifies flooding as one of the biggest risks to communities and businesses in South Asia, and suggests that in India alone 113 million people – 9% of the population – are acutely exposed to flood hazard.

The reasons why India is so exposed are diverse. “India’s most vulnerable areas are characterised by high rates of poverty and poor access to public services, leaving people with a lack of resources to prepare for and recover from natural hazard events,” says Dr Richard Hewston, principal environmental analyst at Verisk Maplecroft. “Communities in rapidly growing urban areas also tend to be among the most vulnerable, as poor urban planning and weak enforcement of building standards means the impacts of natural hazard events are more keenly felt.”

In addition, the country’s dependence on agriculture leaves it highly sensitive to extreme weather events. India derives a greater proportion of GDP (17%) from agriculture than the global average (4%) and the sector employs 47.2% of the population, compared to the global average of 30.7%.

The Indian government has begun to address these vulnerabilities, introducing a $1.3bn crop insurance scheme at the start of this year to help farmers cope with falling market prices and crop failure due to natural disasters. At present only 19% of India’s farmers insure their crops due to lack of awareness about the practice of crop insurance, its cost and lack of availability.

Insurance companies themselves could encourage more resilient business practices, for example by offering products that support the adoption of drip irrigation.

“It is impossible for insurance companies in India not to notice the risks of extreme weather and water scarcity,” says Alejandro Litovsky, CEO and founder of Earth Security Group, which has recently published a report on the role of the insurance sector in India. “Besides their agricultural portfolios, their clients in energy and infrastructure are also being affected as droughts cripple their operations. There is a powerful business case for insurance companies to plan their future growth through companies promoting sustainable agriculture and renewable energy.”

Ultimately, tackling unsustainable business practices requires more than insurance. The Delhi-based Energy and Resources Institute proposed to work with companies to study the impact of climate change on the oil and gas sector. So far, however, only two have signed up to take part. “They’re concerned about numbers for demand of their product, but not about what the climate can do to their business. Everyone’s knowledge is based on hindsight,” says a researcher from the institute who wished to remain anonymous.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Certainly not the residents of Chennai who suffered for days, nor the volunteers who scrambled to provide relief.

Almost a year has passed, and the monsoon is upon us again. Is the city prepared to face a deluge? Has the Government taken preventive measures? Have we learnt any lessons at all from last year?

To find answers to some of these questions, and to push for constructive action towards making Chennai flood-safe, Arappor Iyakkam launched “Kelu Chennai Kelu”, a one-of-a-kind attempt at participatory democracy, a public hearing on the state of Chennai’s preparedness for the monsoon.

All sections of civil society – Resident Welfare Associations, flood relief volunteers, NGOs, and students of city colleges – were invited to participate and share stories from their communities. Invitations were also extended to officials from the PWD, Corporation of Chennai, Metro Water, and also to all MLAs of the Greater Chennai Area, including the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, to attend and listen to the citizen’s questions and suggestions.

But a question remained – would the public come? Or would we demonstrate that notoriously short public memory, and stay busy and apathetic?

Well, the stage was set, and come they did. Rain and Sunday notwithstanding, concerned citizens turned out in impressive numbers. Groups of people, armed with their list of action points, things that the Government needed to do in the next 45 days before the monsoon arrives.

Most heartening though, was that the student community of Chennai turned out in full force. Students from almost all city colleges came in large numbers, and vociferously declared that they are ready to support the Government in any effort, and requested the Government to involve them, and harness their ideas for a better city for all of us.

The representations of the public and the students were patiently heard for over three hours by an eminent panel – Retd IAS Officer and Urban Planning Expert, Shri Devasahayam; Amicus Curiae appointed by the Madras High Court to investigate building violations, Advocate Suresh; Retd PWD Engineer Shri Thirunavukkarasu, and Trustee of Association for Democratic Reforms and Associate Prof IIT-M, Dr. Sudarsan Padmanaban. The panelists are currently summarising the discussions, and will present the findings to all levels of Government for appropriate action.

The best part of the event, and one which made it a truly democratic exercise, was the presence of two officials from the Chennai Corporation, and the MLA from Chepauk Constituency, Shri J Anbazhagan. They noted the grievances raised by the public and promised to look into each of their concerns. It was heartening that Shri Thirumurugan, Chennai Corporation, promised the residents that together, they would ensure that Chennai was resilient enough to face the floods.

There were some heart-wrenching moments too: a hundred students from the St.Louis College for the deaf turned out to show their enthusiasm and Smitha Sadasivan from the Disability Rights Foundation spoke of the impact of natural disasters on the disabled.

And so, Chennai saw the rekindling of the true spirit of democracy, a participative, collaborative process, where citizens are proactive, where government officials are responsive, and where elected representatives are approachable.

And as proof of the pudding, work has begun in right earnest. Desilting and removal of encroachments has already begun in the areas identified by Arappor’s social audit (click here for the Arappor Social audit report)

Now we have hope that the tragedy of last year, the loss of life and property has not been in vain.

A year after unprecedented rainfall caused a massive deluge in Chennai, Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur, Cuddalore and other parts of the state, killing more than 300 people and causing losses running into several thousand crores, the state is still not rain-ready.

In Chennai, one of the worst-affected areas last year, work on desilting, or cleaning up canals and water bodies and unclogging storm water drains – which should have been completed before the monsoons, has just begun.

To complicate matters, the term of the elected representatives of city’s civic body has ended and local body polls to the Chennai Corporation, scheduled in October, were cancelled by the High Court over alleged irregularities inthe poll process.

Administration of the state has also been hit ever since the hospitalisation of AIADMK head and Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa on September 22.

Special officials have now been appointed to the Chennai Corporation to take up flood-prevention measures, but residents, citizen activists and environmentalists have claimed that the last-minute job is shoddy and poorly thought out. Meanwhile, 15 IAS officers appointed as monitoring officers by the government to oversee monsoon preparedness have identified at least 100 major civic issues that could cause flooding this year, according to reports. This includes desilting of canals and rivers, removal of encroachments along waterways and construction of storm water drains in areas that lack an adequate drainage system.

Solution is the problem

A major project that the Chennai Corporation is undertaking is to connect the city's 1,660.31-km long network of storm water drains to several lakes and ponds, so that excess rain water can be emptied into these. Engineers in the Chennai Corporation’s Storm Water Drainage Department who did not wish to be identified confirmed to Scroll.in that 55 water bodies in South Chennai and 95 water bodies in the north would collect outflow from the storm water drain network in the city.

The project, approved in August, is being funded by Germany’s government-owned bank KFW and the Japan International Cooperation Agency. More than Rs 2,000 crores is being pumped into this project.

S Thirunavukkarasu, a retired engineer with the state Public Works Department, said that the plan could, in fact, increase risk of flooding and contaminate the water. “In most residential areas, sewerage lines are connected to these storm water drains,” he said. ""So it is not just excess rainwater that will flow into these lakes and ponds but sewage, garbage and muck. The Chennai Corporation is finding a shortcut to the problems that we are going to face when the monsoon comes. We are holding talks with groups which work towards protecting water bodies.”

Environmentalists that Scroll.in spoke to expressed similar concerns.

KA Jayachandran of the South Chennai Lakes Security Group said the chances of flooding in Chennai could increase if the corporation goes through with project. “Already the water bodies have shrunk because of unauthorised construction,"" he said. ""Also, none of these lakes have been desilted in the last 10 years. If the corporation connects the storm water drains to these lakes too, there is a big chance of flooding in residential areas (as the lakes can overflow)"".

Environment activist KVRK Thirunaranan argued that the sewage carried by these drains would not just harm humans but also disturb the ecology of the water body. “Many migratory birds visit these water bodies and marshes and this will affect them if the water turns into sewage.""

Experts said that the AIADMK government and the AIADMK-led corporation should have learnt from the fate of such projects in the past. In 2001, when the DMK was in power, the government had connected the existing storm water drains to the Cooum and Adyar rivers and the Buckingham Canal, the three main waterways in the city.

""The biggest example is before us – this is what has happened with the Adyar, Cooum rivers and the Buckingham Canal,” said S Janakarajan, water resources expert and professor at the Madras Institute of Development Studies. ""It is only because storm water drains were connected to these waterways that they have turned into sewage ways."" A bulk of the city's untreated sewage makes its way into these waters.

In 2011, Central Chennai was selected for a Rs 1,000-crore project, partly funded by the Centre, to connect more storm water drains to rivers.

Work yet to begin

Officials at the Chennai Corporation, however, claimed that there would be no flooding this year as the water bodies are being connected by a network of canals, so if excess water accumulated in one river, it would be carried to another.

“Around 800 areas in Chennai have been identified as places where water logging happens during rains and so in these places this connection of water bodies has already started,” said the engineer with the Chennai Corporation. “But the work will not get finished before the monsoon starts.”

By the state authorities’ own admission too, work at many of these sites is yet to begin.

In a case filed before the National Green Tribunal in Chennai, petitioner Jawahar Shanmugam had asked the court to direct the Public Works Department of Tamil Nadu to unclog the Buckingham Canal, where the accumulation of silt, debris and water hyacinth has been obstructing the flow of water. On October 27, just three days before the North East Monsoon set in, the PWD informed the court that work on the canal had not begun.

The department submitted that Rs 53.15 lakh would be allocated for “various activities in the South Buckingham Canal” and an additional Rs 60 lakhs had been allotted for “specific works” from Kottivakkam bridge to Okkiyam Maduvu, including the construction of a drainage canal. An estimated Rs 638 lakhs has been allocated for desilting of some water bodies and Rs 91 lakhs for “works in Cooum river.”

“Other waterways” in the city would get Rs 150 lakh, the PWD told the tribunal.

The tribunal directed the PWD to finish the work fast and said it would closely monitor the progress. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for December 12. By then, however, the monsoon would be on its way out and the damage, if any, would already have been done.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Skymet Weather Team

Chennai rains wreaked havoc on the capital city of Tamil Nadu last year. Heavy rain continued for about a month leading to severe flooding over the state capital.

During that time, Chennai has seen it all, clogged roads, food shortage, power woes, traffic disruption and several other problems that even Chennaiites cannot explain in words.

While several controversies have been doing rounds as far as Chennai floods are concerned, after a thorough analysis, even the Union Ministry feels that overflow of dam water at the wrong time and inadequate drainage system may have triggered the Chennai flood massacre.

Another point to be noted is that weather warning for Chennai rains was given at least 48 hours before the occurrence of the disaster. As per a study by scientists, if the disaster response of Tamil Nadu were as quick as in Gujarat as well as Odisha, the disaster could have been entirely avoided.

A part of the Climate Report 2015 has also been given to the Chennai floods. The report provides a detail of the disasters as well as significant climate changes occurred in the country in the year 2015. The report also mentions the floods in Kashmir, drought in Maharashtra. Also explained in the report is why 2015 was the warmest in the world and the third warmest in India.

Had the opening of the overflowing water body avoided and if the drainage systems were adequate, the state could have been saved from a big disaster. During the floods, when people walked on the roads, they were hit by a rapid influx of water, which does not happen with rain water alone.

According to the Centre’s analysis, while Kashmir floods couldn’t be avoided due to narrow outlets and slow movement of water from the valley, Chennai flood assessment could have easily been done by the administration on the local levels, and people could have been evacuated beforehand.

For cities prone to disasters like floods, effective disaster response teams and adequate drainage systems is a must. Proper urban planning also needs to be done to avoid another disaster similar to that of the Chennai rains.

“There is nowhere for the water to go because of unchecked building activity,” said VR Devika, who fled her ground-floor apartment to seek refuge with her upstairs neighbours.

“All the lake areas have been converted into housing colonies,” added the 61-year-old, who runs an arts charity.

What started out as a natural disaster in the state capital of Tamil Nadu soon became a more serious man-made one, with experts blaming bad urban planning and rampant “encroachment” by fly-by-night property developers for making the situation worse.

Similar floods struck Mumbai in 2005 and Kashmir’s winter capital, Srinagar, last year. There, as in Chennai, construction blocked storm water channels and reduced the capacity of reservoirs designed to soak up unseasonal rains.

“As cities grow, with a nod and a wink, unauthorised construction along these channels and lakes chokes water flow,” said Shailesh Pathak, executive director at Bhartiya Group, which has its own smart city project in Bengaluru, runs a special economic zone and is expanding into low-cost housing.

Runway river

The sight of three dozen airliners with their undercarriages covered by flood waters might lead stranded passengers to wonder whether Chennai’s low-lying international airport was built in the wrong place.

Experts say they’d be right: One runway traverses the Adyar river, which burst its banks after some of the heaviest cloudbursts in the area in over a century swamped Chennai.

Some 270 people have died as a result of recent flooding and nearly 1,000 have been seriously injured.

“They have not made any provisions for preventing flood water from entering,” said Mohan Ranganathan, a Chennai aviation expert and former air safety adviser to the national government.

“The authorities and the airlines just have commercial and political interests in mind. Safety is the last avenue.”

While Chennai is not unique, experts say it was worse hit than the rest of India’s southeastern seaboard because of a development boom that has gone unchecked in the last 15 years.

“Chennai needs to relearn its water management,” said Sushmita Sengupta at the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi, adding that it was critical for the city to restore what had once been a good natural drainage system.

The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority has counted more than 150,000 illegal buildings in the city. Yet, despite several demolition orders issued by the Madras high Court, they still stand.

Tamil Nadu chief minister Jayalalithaa Jayaram has described the flood damage as “unavoidable”, according to TV reports.

It was not possible to reach the state government for comment, with mobile and landline networks knocked out by the floods in much of Chennai.

Making cities smarter

In July, 2005, 944mm of rain fell on Mumbai in a single day, leading to the deaths of 500 people. Heavy development had destroyed green spaces and mangrove forests, its natural flood protection, leaving the financial metropolis of 18 million reliant on an inadequate drainage system.

The city set itself an ambitious plan then to install pumping stations, widen drains and clean waterways. But that has missed deadlines, seen significant cost overruns and is running nearly a decade behind schedule.

Bhartiya’s Pathak said that under India’s weak federal framework, Modi alone lacked the power to realise his smart cities initiative that promises a hygienic, networked life for a rising generation of urban Indians.

Better would be to empower major cities to determine their own fate, he said, as with the most successful urban projects in China.

It is quite usual for politicians and civic officials to blame so-called unprecedented rains for the civic and humanitarian crisis each monsoon brings, and decouple development from disaster. But unprecedented rains occur quite regularly in Chennai. As a city on the high-energy coast facing the Bay of Bengal, Chennai is no stranger to heavy rains and cyclonic storms. Chennai has experienced particularly heavy rains roughly once every 10 years—1969, 1976, 1985, 1996, 1998, 2005, 2015.

In fact, in 1976, Adyar river overflowed its banks and invaded first-floor houses. But those were the days when Chennai was derided for being an overgrown village, an underdeveloped aspirant to metropolitan status.

Today, Chennai has a host of expensive infrastructure aimed at ushering in a “Make in Chennai” boom—a brand-new (though leaky) airport built on the floodplains of the Adyar river, a sprawling bus terminal in flood-prone Koyambedu, a Mass Rapid Transit System constructed almost wholly over the Buckingham Canal and the Pallikaranai marshlands, expressways and bypass roads constructed with no mind to the tendency of water to flow, an IT corridor and a Knowledge Corridor consisting of engineering colleges constructed on waterbodies, and automobile, telecom special economic zones (SEZs) and gated residential areas built on important drainage courses and catchments.

With every invitation to Make in Chennai, the city is unmaking itself and eroding its resilience to perfectly normal monsoon weather events. The infrastructure of big commerce has replaced the infrastructure to withstand natural shocks.

The 2015 disaster was not just avoidable; it was a direct consequence of decisions pushed for by vested interests and conceded by town planners, bureaucrats and politicians in the face of wiser counsel.

The case of the Pallikaranai marshlands, which drains water from a 250 square kilometre catchment, is telling. Not long ago, it was a 50 sq km water sprawl in the southern suburbs of Chennai. Now, it is 4.3 sq km—less than a tenth of its original. The growing finger of a garbage dump sticks out like a cancerous tumour in the northern part of the marshland. Two major roads cut through the waterbody with few pitifully small culverts that are not up to the job of transferring the rain water flows from such a large catchment. The edges have been eaten into by institutes like the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT). Ironically, NIOT is an accredited consultant to prepare environmental impact assessments on various subjects, including on the implications of constructing on waterbodies.

Other portions of this wetland have been sacrificed to accommodate the IT corridor. But water offers no exemption to the elite industry. Unmindful of the lofty intellectuals at work in the glass and steel buildings of the software parks, rainwater goes by habit to occupy its old haunts, bringing the back-office work of American banks to a grinding halt.

The vast network of waterbodies that characterised Chennai can only be seen on revenue maps now. Of the 16 tanks belonging to the Vyasarpadi chain downstream of Retteri, none remains, according to professor M. Karmegam of Anna University.

Virtually every one of the flood-hit areas can be linked to ill-planned construction. The Chennai Bypass connecting NH45 to NH4 blocks the east flowing drainage causing flooding in Anna Nagar, Porur, Vanagaram, Maduravoyal, Mugappair and Ambattur. The Maduravoyal lake has shrunk from 120 acres to 25. Ditto with Ambattur, Kodungaiyur and Adambakkam tanks. The Koyambedu drain and the surplus channels from Korattur and Ambattur tanks are missing. Sections of the Veerangal Odai connecting Adambakkam tank to Pallikaranai are missing. The South Buckingham Canal from Adyar creek to Kovalam creek has been squeezed from its original width of 25 metres to 10 metres in many places due to the Mass Rapid Transit System railway stations. Important flood retention structures such as Virugambakkam, Padi and Villivakkam tanks are officially abandoned.

Capacity reduction

Before political rivalry between the two Dravidian parties brought it to a midway halt, an ill-advised Elevated Express freight corridor from Chennai harbour to Maduravoyal had already reclaimed a substantial portion of the Cooum’s southern bank drastically reducing the flood-carrying capacity of the river.

Remarkably, all these causes were listed out by the government’s own officials at a seminar on waterways organised by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority in 2010. But there seems to be many a slip between enlightened understanding and enlightened action.

The Second Masterplan prepared by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority glibly authorises built-up spaces with no regard to hydrology. In the Ennore region, the authority has reclassified waterbodies, intertidal zones and mangrove swamps as “Special and Hazardous Industries” and handed it over to the Kamarajar Port Ltd.

In Ponneri, a town in a rural part of Chennai Metropolitan Area, developers are executing Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority-approved plans with no regard to drainage. Last month, Ponneri received 370 mm of rain. While it suffered from flooding, damage to property and life was not high. Ponneri is slotted to be developed as a smart city.

But will our dumb engineers be able to build a smart city?

The recent heavy record deluge of rainfall over Chennai was due to above normal sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal, presence of monsoon trough close to Chennai, prevailing easterly waves and strong easterly winds. The 2015 El Nino phenomenon weakened South west monsoon winds which in turn led to less churning and upwelling in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea and resulted in higher sea surface temperatures due to less mixing of cold waters with warm surface waters. This had a warming effect in Bay of Bengal. During the post-NW monsoon withdrawal period (later part of October and November) a monsoon trough prevailed around 13N latitude (latitude of Chennai) over peninsular India and Bay of Bengal.

The monsoon trough is a large area of low pressure that can move in any direction and carry convective winds with it. The high SSTs moistened the boundary layer (the lowest layer of the atmosphere in touch with the ocean surface) by evaporation. This moist air was lifted high up in the atmosphere by easterly waves emanating some distance from the coast at Chennai. Easterly waves are an atmospheric phenomenon wherein the wind moves in a wave like motion with the distance from crest to crest being as much as 2000 km (with a forward and rear sections of 1000 km each) and the period about two to three days. “Therefore it can be believed that the phenomenon might have persisted for 3 -4 days with spatial scales of approximately 500-1000km,”said Dr. J.R. Kulkarni, Team Expert, World Meteorological Organization, Ex-Adviser, IITM, Pune, to this Correspondent with whom he was in telephone and email contact.

The upward motion of the winds in the wave is called divergence and the downward, convergence. The divergence lifted moisture bearing air with it and carried it high up into the atmosphere as rain bearing clouds, and the easterly winds drove these clouds towards Chennai where they precipitated as rain. The continuous formation of clouds over Bay of Bengal, their transformation into deep convective clouds, their movement towards land and to Chennai city provided continuous heavy rainfall over land and the Chennai area. These clouds provided very heavy rainfall of the order of 150 mm/hour. If the rainfall is more than 100 mm/hour, then it is termed as a cloud burst.

For converting water into vapour, energy is required to provide to the water molecules. This energy is called latent heat of vaporization. As the water vapor goes up it cools due to ambient cooler atmosphere. It becomes saturated. The water vapor turns into water droplets. In this process, the energy stored in the water vapor is released to the atmosphere. This heats the cloud air. The cloud air becomes warm and light. The cloud air gets acceleration in upward direction because of receiving of latent heat. Temperature in the atmosphere decreases with height. At about 5 km above the ground, temperature becomes 0°C. This is called freezing level. The cloud drops freeze and become ice above freezing level. In the freezing process heat is released which is called latent heat of freezing. The cloud droplets and ice particles get additional upward motion by getting this energy. This way the cloud grows to a very high altitude.

Studies have shown that south west and north east monsoons have negative correlation. North east monsoon during the 2009 El Nino year was stronger than normal. Rainfall in 2009 north east monsoon was 12 per cent more than long term normal (IMD Departmental website Chennai). This year’s high north east monsoon rainfall performance is consistent with earlier findings of negative correlation between the two monsoons in the El Nino years. The higher than normal sea surface temperatures are the real fuel of such deep convection. Climatologically these anomalies weaken in the December. Therefore it may be conjectured that heavy rainfall activity may weaken in December. “Radar data are required to check movement of clouds, their transformation into deep convective clouds, and their spatial and temporal scales. Modeling studies are required for examining various linkages in the proposed mechanism,” said Dr. Kulkarni.

“Extreme weather events are indeed increasing due to global warming. This is because a warmer climate can hold more moisture in the atmosphere, leading to heavier rainfall when it does occur. However, it’s difficult to say for certain that a particular extreme event – like the Chennai floods – is attributable to anthropogenic climate change,” says Dr. Roxy Mathew Koll of The Indian Institute of Tropical Maeteorology, Pune.",discussion,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city and suburbs,494 mm,"Rs. 10,000 crore",464,1.2 million people displaced,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including above-normal sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal, the presence of a monsoon trough close to Chennai, prevailing easterly waves, and strong easterly winds.

Most of these places, in north/south Chennai or the OMR stretch, were badly hit by flooding during the recent rains and residents have moved out.

Did you know that much of north Chennai has been actually built on flood plains and wet lands? Apartments that were sold as ‘lake view’ villas in some of these places, such as Perumbakkam, have been swallowed up by the lake. The OMR-ECR stretch is built on the Pallikaranai marsh. Villivakkam’s SIDCO Nagar, which has housing board and industrial complexes, is in the middle of a tank bed. Research by the Centre for Environmental and Water Resource Engineering of IIT Madras two decades ago showed that Chennai and adjoining areas had about 650 water bodies. Today, only a fraction of those exists.

Lalit Mohan Sharma, Director, Adaptive Technologies, SM Sehgal Foundation, who has been working on water-related issues for more than two decades, says it is the increase in real estate prices and the consequent increase in demand for land in metros which has resulted in encroachment of lake beds.

Many people BusinessLine spoke to seemed to be unaware that the area they reside in is close to a lake or is built on wetland. When buying an apartment, people tend to overlook safety aspects. While the harm has already been done, the insights shared by some of the affected people can be an important lesson for others.

Bose Muthu Kumaran, who works with a financial services company in Chennai, bought an apartment in CTO Colony, Tambaram, two years ago. During the recent rains, water entered his apartment. Within 10-15 minutes the water level increased substantially, and it almost reached the first floor. Though he and his family were evacuated from the apartment by boat, thanks to a rescue team, he couldn’t move his belongings.

Now he is staying with his friends. “I visited my house a few days ago. The water has receded, but the entire place looks deserted. Not many people are back, there is a lot of garbage on the road and there is no power. I will move back to the apartment in a few days, but it will be never be the same for me or my family in that house,” Bose says.

The apartment was bought on a loan. Though Bose now wants to move out of the house and shift to a safer place, he says he can’t afford it. “My EMI is running, I know I will end up paying almost ₹50/60 lakh for my loan of ₹35 lakh for this apartment. Now, thinking back, it seems like madness. I could have paid rent and stayed at a better place.”

But, didn’t Bose know that the place was close to Chembarambakkam lake and during heavy rains there is a flood risk?

“I come from Madurai. I didn’t know this place’s history. Before buying the house, I went around to see neighbouring areas. Sri Sai Nagar and Goodwill Nagar, which are just across where I stay, looked posh with many individual villas. So, I thought the place was safe. I was told by people already residing in the area that it was normal for water stagnation of up to one foot during rains. But because my building was built a good two feet above the road, I thought there would be no problem,” rues Bose.

Encroachment on flood plains is not limited to the Chennai metro alone.

Research by Sushmita Sen Gupta, Deputy Programme Manager with the Centre for Science and Environment, has thrown up some shocking revelations. She says, “in 1925, 60 per cent of the land area in Mumbai was used for agriculture and was covered by forest. But, by the beginning of 1990, the area had shrunk to half its original size.” The six basins of streams that criss-cross the city had been converted into roads, buildings and slums, she adds.

Similarly, in Hyderabad, between 1989 and 2001, 3,245 hectares of water bodies were lost.

Bengaluru’s 2005 floods which sank the entire city should also be blamed on choked drains, says Sushmita Sen Gupta. “The city had 262 lakes in 1960, but today only 10 of them hold water.”

Ganesan, who stays in a rented accommodation in Pazhavanthangal, Chennai, had to rush out of the house to get to a safer place in the middle of the night during the recent rains.

He owns an apartment in another part of the city, but had moved to this one because of its proximity to the railway station.

“I knew there was a lake over which this apartment was built, but, I still wanted to stay there because it was closer to the railway station, making it easy for me to commute to my office. It rains only a few days a year, when I have some difficulty. Otherwise I was happy with the place. For such a nominal rent, I may not get another apartment.”

Asked if he would buy an apartment in Pazhavanthangal, Ganesan says, “No, not anywhere in Chennai. But I will continue to live here because this is where I work.”

Muthiah, a calm and composed person in the mid-30s who stays in Manali New Town, was also a victim of the floods. He had to move his wife, children and aged mother out of his flooded house.

But he says that the roads and connectivity to the city from the area are good and wants to continue living in Manali. “I will take some precautions. Maybe next time I will build a room on the first-floor.”

Srikanth, who bought an apartment in Perumbakkam just a few months ago, is not a happy man. His car, kept in the basement parking, his house and all electronic goods and the furniture have been spoilt by the water that flooded his apartment on December 2. “I bought that apartment only in June. They said it’s a lake view apartment, but the entire place looks like a lake now. I don’t want to go back to that apartment; I have bad memories of it now. But if I sell it now, I don’t know if I will get my capital back,” says Srikanth.

After any natural disaster, property prices go down and they stay low for at least the short term, says Kanchana Krishnan, Director, Knight Frank. “People do not think about money or investments immediately, they generally postpone buying decisions after a calamity.”

Post the 2004 tsunami, prices had crashed in the ECR stretch. But today, after 10 years, prices stand much higher, Kanchana points out.

Many property consultants believe that over the next five-six years, real estate prices will skyrocket in Chennai because of better infrastructure facilities. By infrastructure they probably mean the roads, flyovers, SEZs, IT parks and smart cities and not a better water/drain management system; so watch out. In the north-Chennai region, Kolathur, Tondiarpet and Madhavaram are seeing builders sell projects for ₹4,000-4,500/sq ft.

The high-end apartments in these regions are priced at ₹5,000-6,995/sq ft. They are betting on the Ponneri ‘Smart City’ and phase 2 of the outer ring road connecting Nemmilechery and Minjur.

Some of the worst-hit areas in the recent rains are among the expensive addresses in Chennai. Take, for instance, Velachery, where the going rate is ₹9,000-10,000/sq ft, Saidapet about ₹9,000/sq ft and Kotturpuram about ₹20,000/22,000 per sq ft.

Sanity may return to pricing in some of these places, say a few people. But how long the memories of the flood will last, is not known. The only way to check floods in Chennai is to retrieve all major drains, says, Prof S Janakarajan, of MIDS. “Adyar, Buckingham, Kosasthalaiyar, Cooum…they should all be restored,” he adds.

Across India, city after city has experienced floods, while some others live with the fear of impending disasters. In Mumbai, flooding was caused by wrong developments at the Bandra estuary and negligence along the Mithi river, and in Uttarakhand the disaster was caused by unplanned regional development and the unholy nexus between the land mafia and politicians. The Srinagar valley suffers from an unfortunate geographical disadvantage of being the recipient of water from an enormous watershed above the valley. Water bodies in and around Chennai have been filled up, leaving no space for rainwater to escape when it pours. The deluge and the repercussions have lessons for us for future urban planning.(Reuters File)

Meanwhile, in Delhi, the two governments are merrily building on the city’s flood plains, ignoring the ministry of environment, which is supposed to protect the Delhi Ridge and the Yamuna river. Calcutta’s new growth is entirely in the wetland area, creating multiple infrastructure barriers for surface water flow from the mother city, which in any case has a lower elevation than the Hooghly river. In the past decades, Bangalore’s expansion had been at the cost of an elaborate pond system in the sub-region, a majority of the scattered ponds being built upon by land sharks. The Bruhat Bangalore Development Plan came too late, while artificial land values were created by project-driven infrastructure. In other words, all our metropolitan cities have ignored watershed management and environmental planning to their own peril. This is the juncture in India’s urbanisation when thousands of crores are being poured into the urban centres, coupled with a policy shift in the Environmental Impact Assessment in order to facilitate ‘growth’ for easing the sanction process. All these are also ‘Smart Cities’, ‘AMRUT Cities’ and investment destinations for ambitious metro projects and they are identified as new growth centres of our ‘surging’ economy. In the absence of a proper National Policy for Urbanisation, our metropolitan cities are sitting ducks for all sorts of natural disasters. Spineless local planning organisations, which are subservient to their administrative and political masters, are not willing to put their technical know-how on the table, for fear of punishment transfers and mafia-induced pressures.

The Chennai floods show all these problems can surface in other Indian cities. The geography of South India demonstrates how rivulets, ponds, streams and rivers emanating from the Western Ghats flow towards the East to the Tamil Nadu coast. On the other hand, this coast is also highly vulnerable to storms, depression, tsunami and floods. Chennai is one such area where an enormous watershed finally drains into the sea through its rivers and canals. Has any regional planning exercise recognised this primary natural layer on which urban development forms the secondary layer? No. On the contrary, the watershed on the west of Chennai has been the major venue for industrialisation in corridors going up to Kanchipuram further to the west.

Traditionally the sub-region surrounding Chennai had big and small ponds connected by a working overflow system. The water was allowed to spread into fields and thousands of smaller ponds, with the entire region acting as a ‘sponge’ to absorb the excess water, supporting paddy fields and fish farming. These overflow systems and multiple canals finally find their way to lakes that surround Chennai city. Finally the rivers in Chennai absorb this flow.

In Tamil Nadu’s hurry to industrialise, these watershed areas have been ravaged, with all the major industries, new educational institutions, housing estates, etc. coming up in the past two decades. Thousands of smaller ponds and streams have been filled up, increasing the surface water flow manifold. The major tanks are silted and the amount of water flowing into them has increased. This increased run-off has found its way into the city. Unprecedented rain, induced by climate change, has compounded the problem. While the disaster has been caused by nature, the impact would not have been so severe but for the man-made factors.

The second dimension of Chennai’s flood is another man-made (read planning-made) problem. The Adyar river in the south of the original city had a wide estuary and also a wide flood plain. Many areas south of the river have been marshy and low-lying, serviced by small rivulets and canals. Most submerged areas with floor-high water are on this part of the city, including the IT Park and many multinational corporate headquarters, paralysing business not only in Chennai but across the country and outside.

All the swamps, marsh lands, low-lying areas and streams that these big corporations, middle class housing and slums have built on are inundated as they are at the receiving end of overflowing large regional tanks.

The planned developments along the Adyar river that reduced its capacity as a water outlet are largely government-sponsored as the river bed was in government ownership. In the past three decades, massive housing, planned and unplanned, has cannibalised the river bed, leading to increased flooding, and damaged Chennai’s technology nerve centres and put millions of residents in danger. Chennai is indeed a sordid story of all the ills that plague India’s subservient planning system. Our inability to enforce environmental laws and insatiable greed for land grabbing by both national and international commercial interests are in full play in Chennai. The silver lining, however, is the enormous outflow of altruism, public mindedness and compassion Chennai’s citizens have displayed in the face of this calamity.

Pinning responsibility for faulty planning and political decisions, preparing a scientific watershed management plan, putting in place a disaster warning system, and addressing the immediate problems of the urban poor are the first steps forward. Chennai’s citizens have a resurgent spirit. That indeed is the human capital to build on.

NATURE’S FURY OR THE GREED OF MAN?

Though such floods are often officially referred to as natural disaster, there is always an element of human negligence behind them. Many so called natural disasters in India have been a result of mindless exploitation of our environment. Such disasters are a reminder that we have to care for our environment much more than what we are doing now.

The death and destruction caused in Chennai by torrential rains would have been much lesser if the lakes were not encroached upon and rivers not mined indiscriminately for quarrying.

Until few years, all the rivers and lakes in Chennai were connected by channels. Unfortunately, all those connections have been destroyed. The sand mafia and land grabbers have taken the land in between the canals, tanks and water channels. Owing to scanty rainfall in the recent past, there was no water in those canals. People have built homes in these areas, most of them low-lying.

Because of such encroachments, there is no outlet for water to flow when one tank is full and the city gets easily flooded. The recent floods around Chennai are not a natural disaster, but a man-made tragedy created by unrestrained construction.

FLOODGATES OF MISMANAGEMENT

I was told that the officials concerned delayed in opening the floodgates despite the reservoirs reaching their full capacity. By the time they opened the gates it was too late.

This is attributed to a delay in obtaining permission from the higher authorities. Despite having technical knowledge about what to do in such situations, the officials were scared to act without an order. During such situations when superiors or seniors are not available, one must use his or her common sense and act. One must have the courage to take responsibility and be ready to face the consequences for the larger good.

VOLUNTEERS IN ACTION

On the brighter side, the disaster has brought out the goodness in people. It is touching to see people from all backgrounds set aside their differences and come together to help the victims. Nature has strange ways of uniting people.

I deeply appreciate the work of our volunteers who were helping the people stuck in the floods. The Art of Living volunteers supplied cooked food in almost all flood-affected areas of Chennai and distributed over 700 tons of relief material. Many volunteers went into the flooded areas to provide help braving above-waist water-levels.

Let us all come together and help the people of Chennai, in whatever way we can. It’s time to remember that man-made disasters are easily preventable and take remedial actions.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The catastrophic flooding in Chennai is the result of the heaviest rain in several decades, which forced authorities to release a massive 30,000 cusecs from the Chembarambakkam reservoir into the Adyar river over two days, causing it to flood its banks and submerge neighbourhoods on both sides. It did not help that the Adyar’s stream is not very deep or wide, and its banks have been heavily encroached upon over the years.

Similar flooding triggers were in action at Poondi and Puzhal reservoirs, and the Cooum river that winds its way through the city.

While Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa said, during the earlier phase of heavy rain last month, that damage during the monsoon was “inevitable”, the fact remains that the mindless development of Chennai over the last two decades — the filling up of lowlands and choking of stormwater drains and other exits for water — has played a major part in the escalation of the crisis.

On the evidence of what is currently unfolding in Chennai, city authorities would appear to have the abandoned the concept of stormwater drains — the fundamental instrument of flood-fighting — altogether over the years. Experts at Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) pointed out that the key parameter of rain intensity measure — which ought to be at least 1 inch per hour — has been ignored while planning multicrore drainage projects.

While stormwater drains are supposed to be planned on the basis of detailed topographical data, their linkage with water bodies, construction along their course, and the design of roads have rarely been seen as part of a whole. As a result, drains constructed over the past decade have repeatedly proved inefficacious — and showed up problems of poor urban planning nearly every monsoon.

Planning officials said contractors are rarely briefed on the topography or the flood character of sites. A top civic official said even the water log data of the last 10 years are often not considered as officials “hurry to complete works” before the allocated funds lapse. A former CMDA planner said mandatory standards based on data on sea level and water flows are not followed, resulting in situations like Koyambedu, the neighbourhood that saw expensive stormwater drain projects, but has still gone under.

Across Chennai, illegal construction has been making neighbourhoods unrecognisable — what may have been a tank, lake, canal or river 20 years ago, is today the site of multistorey residential and industrial structures. There are over 1.5 lakh illegal structures in the city, according to a report submitted by CMDA to the Madras High Court. Despite several HC orders ordering their demolition, the buildings stand — often after appeals to the Supreme Court, and due to the inefficiency of the CMDA’s legal wing. Hundreds of stay orders against demolition orders have been obtained by both business houses and individuals.

As the illegal structures sprouted in the city and suburbs, over 300 water bodies disappeared. The irreversible destruction of the city’s natural water paths can be seen in the flooding in Mudichur, Velachery, and several other areas that have come up on wetlands or river basins.

After a major flood in 2005, Chennai had commissioned a project to prepare laser terrain maps, scanning the entire city from a helicopter, instead of depending on topographic maps. But this project remains unimplemented — just like the early warning system that was prepared by the Department of Remote Sensing at Anna University to understand the run-off pattern of rainwater.

El Niño to blame, other factors too

An exceptionally strong El Niño, along with a rare “coincidence of various factors”, has resulted in the heavy rain in Tamil Nadu this northeast monsoon season, officials at India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.

The El Niño phenomenon — an unusual warming of surface waters in the equatorial Pacific Ocean — is “intensely strong” at present, Additional Director-General of Meteorology (Research) at IMD, B Mukhopadhyay, said. “In a strong El Niño year like the present one, the summer (southwest) monsoon is adversely affected, while the northeast monsoon or the winter monsoon is favourably affected.”

However, Mukhopadhyay added, “the present very heavy rain is exceptional and not normal.”

The 2015-16 El Niño could turn out to be the strongest ever recorded — in fact, by one measure, it has already reached that milestone. In mid-November, the sea surface temperature in the central tropical Pacific was 3 degrees Celsius warmer than normal, the largest positive deviation in recorded history. To officially beat the 1997-98 El Niño as history’s worst, sea surface temperatures must stay at these levels for three months.

Other than the El Niño, a strong upper air divergence and high moisture content at lower levels, have contributed to the rain, Mukhopadhyay said. “These two factors, along with formation of low pressure systems have resulted in the heavy rainfall,” he said.

In the case of Chennai, there was one key cause: the Adyar river basin has been taken over for the new airport, just as other stretches have been used to develop residential spaces. Denied its natural path, excess water flooded the neighbourhood. Till nature unleashed its excess, planners ignored the risks; and, look what we got.

We have seen this pattern play out earlier in Mumbai and more recently in the devastating floods that gutted Srinagar. And almost in every instance, the central cause is easy to ascertain: unplanned urbanization inspired by an utter disregard for basic norms. Yet, every time the import of the tragedy fades along with public memory. Like in Chennai, a disaster is waiting to happen in Delhi, with authorities, in their wisdom, allowing some of the flood plains to accommodate the swanky Commonwealth Games village.

It is this business-as-usual approach that is worrying. This struck home with the passing of another dubious milestone last week: The 31st anniversary of the Bhopal gas tragedy—India’s worst industrial disaster. It passed by almost unnoticed (unlike its 30th anniversary). The tragedy, as in the case of Chennai, is that there is no evidence that any lessons have been learnt, leave alone the fact that the inadequately compensated people affected by the tragedy are still dealing with the deadly consequences of the methyl isocyanate gas leak.

It is not just the frequency of disasters—which is alarmingly on the rise—it is that the country is particularly risk-prone. Due to a combination of topography and high population density, India is particularly vulnerable to disasters, and the authorities are well aware of it. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the apex body for disaster management, provides us a risk profile on its website:

* More than 58.6% of the landmass is prone to earthquakes of moderate to very high intensity

* More than 40 million hectares (12%) of its land is prone to floods and river erosion

* Close to 5,700km, out of the 7,516km long coastline, is prone to cyclones and tsunamis

* 68% of its cultivable area is vulnerable to droughts (several states, particularly in central and north India, are suffering the ravages of back-to-back droughts in the past two years)

* Its hilly areas are at risk from landslides and avalanches (as the flash floods in Leh and Ladakh underlined in 2010).

The NDMA’s website has this humbling homily to add: “Disaster risks in India are further compounded by increasing vulnerabilities related to changing demographics and socioeconomic conditions, unplanned urbanization, development within high-risk zones, environmental degradation, climate change, geological hazards, epidemics and pandemics.""

And what it says next is what should serve as a wake-up call to all—governments as well as citizens. Clearly, all these “contribute to a situation where disasters seriously threaten India’s economy, its population and sustainable development"". If this is not enough to drive home the point, then check out a recent report by the World Resources Institute (WRI), which says that India tops the list of 163 nations affected by river floods in terms of the number of people. According to it, every year, the lives of 4.85 million Indians are disrupted by floods, risking $14.3 billion of gross domestic product.

It is apparent then that India is at risk from disasters. It is also obvious that urbanization and high-density population pockets are emerging as the new way of life. Take the two together and there is only one conclusion: without sustainability, India’s urbanization is a recipe for disaster.

Chennai is perhaps experiencing the worst impact of freak weather, but the city could have fared better had it protected and preserved its natural water bodies and drainage channels, experts at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said on Thursday.

The unprecedented deluge that Chennai has been subjected to is a reminder of increasing frequency of such freak weather events across the Indian sub-continent, they said.

Speaking on the subject, CSE director-general Sunita Narain said: “We have repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that our urban sprawls such as Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Srinagar etc. have not paid adequate attention to the natural water bodies that exist in them. In Chennai, each of its lakes has a natural flood discharge channel which drains the spillover. But we have built over many of these water bodies, blocking the smooth flow of water. We have forgotten the art of drainage. We only see land for buildings, not for water.”

Waterbodies

CSE’s research shows that Chennai had more than 600 waterbodies in the 1980s, but a master plan published in 2008 said that only a fraction of the lakes could be found in a healthy condition. According to records of the State’s Water Resources Department, the area of 19 major lakes has shrunk from a total of 1,130 hectares (ha) in the 1980s to around 645 ha in the early 2000s, reducing their storage capacity. The drains that carry surplus water from tanks to other wetlands have also been encroached upon.

Stormwater drains The analysis also shows that the stormwater drains constructed to drain flood waters are clogged and require immediate desiltation. Chennai has only 855 km of stormwater drains against 2,847 km of urban roads. Thus, even a marginally heavy rainfall causes havoc in the city.

A number of cities including Chennai are both water-scarce as well as prone to flooding. Both problems are related — excessive construction leads to poor recharge of groundwater aquifers and blocking of natural drainage systems.

Sushmita Sengupta, deputy programme manager with CSE’s water team, said: “While Chennai has been struggling to meet its water needs and has been even desalinating seawater at a huge expense, it allowed its aquifers to get depleted.”

Chennai’s human-made drainage is no replacement for its natural drainage systems — a CSE analysis shows that there are natural canals and drains that directly connect the city with wetlands, waterbodies and rivers such as the Cooum and the Adyar that run through Chennai. The Cooum is supposed to collect surplus water from 75 tanks in its catchment area within the Chennai Metropolitan Area, while the Adyar is supposed to carry the surplus water of about 450 tanks in its catchment area and also from the Chembarambakkam tank (which is not in its catchment).

The rains in Chennai have broken a 100-year record (374 mm in just 24 hours). In November, the city had received 1,218 mm of rain, which was almost three times more than the average the city receives (407 mm).

A 2006 study by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune had said that extreme precipitation events were increasing in frequency and intensity in India during the period from 1950 to the 2000s.

CSE’s climate change experts say that while detailed attribution studies needed to be done to find out more links between the Chennai catastrophe and climate change, existing scientific studies do establish the possibility of a connection.",issue,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city and suburbs,"1,218 mm",USD 1.5 billion,464,10 million people affected,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage, and encroachment on water bodies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

CHENNAI: Crippling floods in the city have caused huge losses to the IT industry. IT insiders have pegged the losses at $5-10 million for mid-size firms and $40-50 million for large companies. Cognizant TCS and other IT firms have been organizing buses every hour to send employees to Bangalore. Around 2000 employees of each of these companies have already left to work out of Bangalore. HR departments of IT companies are trying to contact each and every employee in Chennai to check their status. Many employees are still stranded in their homes.Apart from IT sector, automobile industry chamber have estimated the possible losses to be around Rs 15,000 crore. According to Assocham, small and medium enterprises, engineering, textiles and tourism sectors have also been badly hit by the flooding.Automakers like Hyundai, Renault-Nissan, Ashok Leyland and Royal Enfield remained closed on Thursday and industry sources said things are likely to remain ""at a standstill mode"" till Saturday. What's more Chennai is also a major auto parts hub. So, the floods could hobble production in automobile factories across the country, said industry experts. The seriousness of the situation can be gauged by the fact that top executives, like the CEO of Ashok Leyland, had to be evacuated and several companies said they were working to help out executives stuck in rain-ravaged areas.As Chennai continued to fight back unprecedented rain and floods, the death toll climbed to 450 since the onset of monsoon in October-end in the city and neighbouring districts. With the forecast of intermittent rain, sometimes heavy, for Chennai and heavy rain in the delta districts of Tamil Nadu, Army and NDRF teams speeded up rescue and relief operations.On day four of the latest round of rain onslaught, anger swept across the city as state departments fumbled with the key task of coordinating among central agencies and NGOs raining relief materials on the state and the virtual crumbling of Chennai's infrastructure.

On ordinary days, it is an anaemic rivulet contaminated with sewage that ekes its way to the estuary at the Bay of Bengal. The river cuts the city in half: Government and old Madras to the north, residential and tech Chennai to the south. The river bends a few times in the city—at Jafferkhanpet, Saidapet, Kotturpuram and Adyar—as it languorously makes its way to the sea. Near each of these locations is a major road bridge across the river.

Following weeks of steady rain in November and a deluge on 1 December, the Adyar flooded its banks and inundated its floodplain, bringing misery upon an entire city. The problem was compounded—some say caused—by the release of water from the Chembarambakkam (earlier called Puliyur) dam, about 40km upstream.

The reservoir was dangerously close to full capacity. The official estimate was that 30,000 cusecs were released from the dam into the Adyar during that fateful night, but unofficial estimates that include output from surrounding water bodies put that number at 100,000 cusecs.

In a tragic misjudgment, a usually parched city set about conserving its drinking water when instead it should have steadily released it in the days leading up to the deluge.

The Chennai airport and its runways—west of the city—are built right beside the Adyar and on its floodplain. The second runway was extended five years ago by building a bridge over the river—the bridge simply ladled the water straight into the airport. The entire airport complex was flooded and remained so for several days. Jafferkhanpet, Defence Colony, Saidapet, Kotturpuram, Nandanam and parts of Adyar were flooded to first-floor levels.

So, the sequence of catastrophe and failure goes like this: El Niño and global warming probably led to the unprecedented rain; mismanagement of the reservoir and haphazard urban planning and misuse of land through illegal construction exacerbated the problem; and the lack of early warning and preparedness sealed the city’s misery.

The armed forces—the army and navy in particular—and 50 teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) did a good job of mitigating the impact by rescuing stranded citizens and distributing essentials. The navy pressed its amphibious warship INS Airavat into service with supplies and used drones to locate the worst-hit areas. Chennai’s denizens supported each other through the crisis and the city is now slowly returning to normal.

So what are the lessons for India’s cities?

As one tweet had it, “before India sets about creating smart new cities, it should make its existing cities less dumb"". This profound observation has many facets.

The first is to assess which cities are prone to floods and in what manner. Coastal cities with rivers that also get heavy rainfall—Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai—are more prone to floods than non-coastal cities without rivers (Bengaluru for instance).

The cities of North India on the path of the great rivers—Yamuna and Ganga—such as Delhi, Allahabad and Patna are at risk. Garbage and silted storm water drains are a threat everywhere. Land subsidence—a gradual sinking of land often caused by ground water exploitation—results in a saucer-like capacity to draw floodwater.

Technology and data must form the basis to decide what measures of flood resilience are best suited for the city in question. Laser altimeter terrain mapping and high-resolution satellite imagery are required for the accurate measurement of low- and high-level areas in a city localized to neighbourhoods and streets. Images to determine palaeochannels (historical but not visible former paths of a river) can help define which parts of the river and its floodplain should be left alone.

Ironically, all of this was talked about in Chennai, but none of it practised.

In general, Europe has more useful lessons for riverine flood management than the US. The Netherlands has implemented an innovative new programme called Room for the River that mitigates flooding risks.

Bunds or dykes are located further inland allowing a broader floodplain, the perennial channel of the river is dredged to make it deeper, an explicit high-water channel is sometimes created and the reservoir is dredged to allow greater capacity. The need for better reservoir management is one crucial lesson from Chennai’s disaster.

Not only existing cities, but also two high-profile new ones are going to be built on or near riverbeds. Panvel, in New Mumbai, will house the new airport and will be surrounded by the Panvel Creek and the Kalundre River. The capital of Andhra Pradesh, named Amaravati, will come up on the southern banks of the River Krishna, in the vicinity of a village called Uddandarayunipalem.

The lessons from Chennai will need to be considered seriously in designing these cities.

P.S.: Sung in a different context, pop-singer Adele’s song Water Under the Bridge from Album 25 reflects Chennai’s plight:

If you are not the one for me

Then I’ll come back

And bring you to your knees!

Story highlights Sreedhar Potarazu: Even as climate change pact was being hammered out, flooding was devastating Chennai, India He says it's a wake-up call on what happens when climate changes meet poor urban planning

CNN —

On November 30, nearly 150 world leaders gathered in Paris to discuss the global impact of climate change and the responsibility that emerging nations like India and China have to help slow or reverse it. Nearly two weeks later, representatives of 196 nations reached a historic agreement to limit the rise in worldwide temperatures by reducing and ultimately eliminating greenhouse gas emissions.

What went largely unnoticed during that time was that just two days into the talks, on December 2, the city of Chennai, India – named one of the “hottest cities of 2015” by the BBC and one of the “52 places to go in 2014” by The New York Times – went underwater. A rainfall of epic proportions triggered the region’s worst flood in over 100 years, drowning a city of 4.8 million.

Three hundred people died, but they weren’t killed by ISIS and they weren’t the victims of a mass shooting. The headlines were buried along with the victims.

November was the rainiest month in Chennai’s history, so the land was saturated when the skies burst, pounding the city with 11 inches of rain, 34 times the daily average. Scientists say an El Nino of unprecedented strength dramatically raised temperatures in the Indian Ocean and was the cause of all the rain.

Millions were left without food and clean water and some of India’s largest industries were devastated – all while the leaders of the world were talking about climate change in Paris.

The countries that negotiated the deal now have a responsibility not only to talk about stemming climate change, but to help countries recover from the devastation it has already caused and will continue to cause.

They want India to step up. But who is stepping up for India?

As the waters recede in Chennai, the metropolitan area – the 36th largest in the world – risks epidemics of malaria, cholera, hepatitis and skin infections. And to complicate matters, Chennai hosts one of the largest artistic festivals in the world every December.

Millions of people from all over the world come to the city for a full month of cultural performances. They could be visiting a cesspool of diseases and bringing them back home. If an epidemic breaks out in Chennai over the next 30 days, it could easily become a pandemic.

If this is not a wake-up call to the world, then what is?

The Chennai disaster is being called a “perfect storm,” a shining example of what can happen when climate change meets poor urban planning.

Chennai allowed development near its waterways to go unchecked for decades, dooming the city when it confronted a 100-year storm, just as New Orleans failed to meet the challenge of Hurricane Katrina.

But everyone knows about Katrina. Chennai, on the other hand, has barely hit the global radar screen. The worst flooding in the world this year, the economic loss from which is expected to amount to $3 billion, has received remarkable inattention.

The Prime Minister has visited the city and declared it a major disaster area, and the Indian government has provided major funding, but you’d never know it here in the United States. You have to search very hard on the Indian Embassy’s website to find so much as a clue that something happened in Chennai. There’s nothing on the Embassy’s Facebook page, either, and the Indian ambassador hasn’t said a word. That’s astonishing. It’s inexcusable when help is needed.

Chennai has always been the cultural capital of India, and hundreds, if not thousands, of artists who live there have dedicated themselves to preserving and advancing the nation’s cultural heritage.

Many of them had to be airlifted from their homes when over 12 feet of water came in. Hundreds of musicians and talented artists lost their homes, their instruments, their paintings, their sculptures. Some lost their lives.

But Chennai is proving resilient – not because of assistance from other countries or international charitable organizations, but because of the spirit and character of the community itself. It is creative, determined and passionate. Hindu, Muslim and Christian. The people of Chennai have come together to help each other.

In the midst of global calamities where people are truly suffering, Chennai’s resilience demonstrates the power of the human spirit.

People in Mudichur, Tambaram, Saidapet, Jafferkhanpert and Velachery have lost their computers, cellphones besides cars and two-wheelers, while their TVs and refrigerators lay submerged, the official explained.

In just Tambaram 20,000 people suffered waterlogging after their basement and ground floor were flooded. Our revenue staff, who are now expediting relief, pointed out that at least 2,000 cars from Tambaram, Mudhichur, Lakhshmipuram, Manimangalam and Krishna Nagar have submerged. Similar is the situation with Velachery and Madipakkam, he said.

Villagers have lost their crops, cattle and their hutments in Tiruvallur, Cuddalore and Kanchee-puram districts, the official, now monitoring the relief work, told Deccan Chronicle.

The estimated revenue expenditure of Tamil Nadu for 2015 is around Rs 1,47,297 crores and the rain damage will push these expenses up to an alarming level, the official revealed.

Furthermore, industrial units, factories, hotels and shops have suffered severe waterlogging and this loss is yet to be evaluated. The state’s financial resources that may be spent first on relief and restoring the infrastructure would again run into crores of rupees, the official explained.",flood,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",12 November 2015,15 December 2015,"['Chennai', 'Tiruvallur', 'Cuddalore', 'Kancheepuram']","['12 November: 244 mm', '13 November: 210 mm', '14 November: 180 mm', '15 November: 150 mm']","['Rs 50,000 crore', 'Rs 1 lakh crore']",['280'],"['Loss of homes, property, and livelihoods', 'Disruption of transportation and communication', 'Water contamination and disease outbreaks']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

A senior official from the General Insurance Corporation, the sole domestic reinsurer, said that the company is still receiving estimates from insurers but cumulative losses are likely to be under ₹500 crore for the industry.

Most claims have come for automobiles and property and from small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Chennai-headquartered United India Insurance received the largest number of claims amounting to ₹130 crore, primarily for automobiles and from small-scale units.

G Srinivasan, Chairman and Managing Director of New India Assurance, said that the company has received claims amounting to ₹35 crore.

He said that the magnitude of lossfor general insurers may not be as big as that seen during Cyclone Hudhud which affected Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and the floods in Jammu and Kashmir as most claims have come from flooding in low-lying areas and there have been no major losses to industries, apart from small stock losses.

Last year, natural disasters such as the floods in Jammu and Kashmir and Cyclone Hudhud led to insured losses of around ₹1,500 crore and ₹4,000 crore, respectively.

Easwara Narayanan, Chief Operating Officer, Future Generali India Insurance, said that the company has received 45 claims till date with a total claim size of ₹8 crore mainly from affected areas like Chennai, Puducherry and Cuddalore.

Tata AIG General Insurance has received around 30 claims for motor and property so far.

“We don’t see a major trigger for large claims as it was not a cyclone and most of the claims will come from only flooding,” M Ravichandran, President - Insurance, TATA AIG General Insurance, said.

Bajaj Allianz General Insurance has received close to 240 claims primarily for high-end vehicles and property. Sasikumar Adidamu, Chief Technical Officer, Non-motor, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, said, “We have received many claims from the property segment pertaining to industrial and commercial units. The damages are mostly to stock, equipment and machineries in industrial units and warehouses due to inundation.”",flood,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",12 November 2015,17 November 2015,"Chennai, Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur, Cuddalore, Villupuram",494 mm,₹500 crore,46,"10 lakh people displaced, 50,000 houses damaged",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

As the recent deluge recedes and landmarks in the city become visible once again, sheets of water vanish to reveal the black tar on roads, and a battered population tries to get back to its feet, images of rains, floods and suffering from the past come to the mind.

Though cyclones, depressions and storms are an annual occurrence in Chennai, some years like 1985, when former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran was evacuated from his Ramapuram garden home, or 1976, when the Army stepped in to keep the Manali oil refinery running, are unforgettable.

1903- Rains bring floods

In 1903, the year the Indian National Congress session was held in Madras, the city faced heavy rains and floods. Historian V. Sriram says that leading lawyer and judge of the Madras High Court V. Krishnaswamy Iyer, who was the main force behind the session, had put up delegates at his bungalow on Luz Church Road. “After the session, his work was greatly appreciated by those in the welcoming committee and even by Dada Bhai Navroji, who was impressed by his shraddai ,” he says.

1918 - 'Cyclone of unusual fury'

The year 1918 too was bad. “A terrible cyclone of unusual fury passed through Madras. The Madras public was quite unprepared to meet the uncommon storm as the report was received yesterday and could not be published in the newspapers,” says a report in The Hindu on November 11, 1918.

1943: No trains to ride

Writer Ashokamitran, who came to Madras in 1943 to drop his sister at her husband’s home in Saidapet, recalls how trains wouldn’t ply to Saidapet due to the rain. “We had bought tickets for Saidapet but the train stopped at Mambalam. We took a jutka to Saidapet and dropped her,” he says. It was in 1943 that The Hindu ’s Srinivasan offered to print other newspapers when power supply was restored to The Hindu alone.

The 1985 floods bear a semblance to this year’s fury. The Kotturpuram slum clearance board tenements were flooded, with Ambattur and Madhavaram dairies flooded most of the city went without milk, water from Chembarambakkam was released and people residing on the banks were cautioned to move to safer places. It was this year too that Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran and his wife Janaki shifted to the Connemara Hotel after waters from the raging Adyar river surrounded their Ramavaram Garden house. He took a boat from his house to reach his car parked on higher ground on the Porur Road and then drove to the hotel.

In more recent times, in 2005, torrential rain, caused by a deep depression over the Bay of Bengal, disrupted life in Chennai and northern Tamil Nadu in October. At least 50,000 people were shifted to relief centres, as houses in several low-level areas were submerged. The rainstorm in northern Tamil Nadu came just as the Cauvery districts were slowly recovering from the heavy flooding that followed huge inflows into the river from Karnataka.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

City opens its doors

It’s early yet on Wednesday morning, but Dr. Sai Kishore from Paalavakkam is busy wading through water-logged streets, handing out packets of food to those in need. The medico who runs the K.L. Hospital in Neelankarai, threw open his hospital doors for those stranded in the rain. “As of last evening we had at least 10 families take shelter at the hospital. We went around picking up those stranded in the hospital ambulance. After a point though the ambulance could not ply on the water-logged streets. Now, my team and I are going around the area distributing packets of food that we cooked in the hospital mess to those in need,” he explains, adding, “The way the city has come together to help others in need is very encouraging. There is such a sense of unity at this time of crisis.”Help came from all corners as Sowmya Reddy put together a crowd-sourced Google doc encouraging people to open up their homes to those affected by the floods. With nearly 225 volunteers posting their contact details and offering to host people in their homes, the list has come as a boon for the city.

Naveen Kumar, an IT employee who lives in Kotturpuram, had people from the Mandaveli area seek refuge at his house. “I did the same last week and am more than willing to host people this time round too. The situation is pretty bad and it’s the one way I could extend help, so why not? I had two people come over last night and we provided them with food and shelter,” he says.

While Suresh Kumar, a volunteer from Medavakkam, didn’t receive any calls from people looking for shelter, he did receive calls from people wading through the flood waters and looking for some food. “A group of people got in touch with me through my listing. They had been walking from OMR to Kovilavakkam through water-logged streets and were looking for something to eat, before they could continue their walk home. I got food packed from a nearby restaurant and went and gave it to them. Anybody looking for shelter is most welcome to get in touch with me,” he says.

Help comes from New York

Krtgrphr, a New York-based Chennaiite spent 15 hours volunteering information on the Internet Kartik, who goes by @krtgrphr on Twitter, is managing many tabs on his laptop sitting in New York. On any other day, this would seem like a normal activity for someone who is online a lot, but Tuesday night and Wednesday morning were all about offering help to strangers stranded in Chennai due to the rain. Krtgrphr (who prefers to go by his Twitter handle) has been volunteering for 15 hours non-stop so far, and is still going strong. From contributing to the document on '#ChennaiRains Resource Center' (chennairains.org) to just as simply spreading the word by retweeting important information and sharing important numbers, the 29-year-old researcher for IBM is making a difference, just like many others on popular social networking sites.

“There’s so much to do behind the scenes; we’re all just a bunch of people who have time on our hands,” he says. On Twitter, trying to find information on what was going on in Chennai, krtgrphr admits that he was feeling helpless about not being able to “effect change on the ground. So you try to do anything you can.”

While a lot of people have opened up their homes, some have started distributing food packets, water and clothes in their areas. How can people sitting at home help? “They can help us right now by connecting those without connections or power or battery to rescue services, food, shelter etc.

And help anyone you see around,” he urges. As a former resident of Chennai, krtgrphr is one of the many who has used social media to effect change for the good. “It’s the participants that make Twitter what it really is.”

Fishermen sail in to help

The fishermen of Chennai are rowing their boats in the flooded streets of the city to rescue those who are stranded. Boats from places such as Kasimedu, Kottivakkam Kuppam, and Kovalam are being transported in trucks along with fishermen-volunteers to the flood-hit regions. “We rescued some 400 people since morning,” says Selvam, a fisherman from Kovalam. A trained life-guard and surfer, Selvam reached Pallikaranai early in the day along with 18 men from the fishing village.

“We’ve brought three fibre boats, each of which can carry 18 people,” he calls out on the phone from the rescue site over the sound of ambulance sirens. “Those we ferried to safety are all from settlements along the Pallikaranai marsh; they’ve lost everything.”

Selvam and team have put in place a well-planned rescue operation. “The moment we help people into our boats, we row towards safe zones that our men have identified. They wait there for us along with a local who guides us,” he explains. Fisherman Mohan from Kottivakkam also had an early start as he made his way in his fibre boat to rescue those who were stranded. “A lot of men from the kuppam have gone along with him,” says his wife Nithya. “They’ve taken several boats with them… I hope they’re all safe.”

M.D. Dayalan, president of the Indian Fishermen Association, says that Kasimedu alone has offered 40 boats for rescue work. “Our men are coordinating with the Fisheries Department. Boats from as far as Neelankarai and Kanathur are in the city, helping people in low-lying areas.”

Restaurants spring into action

With rescue efforts pouring in, some of the restaurants in the city have also sprung into action. On Tuesday night Japtej Ahluwalia and Nikesh Lamba of Double Roti offered complimentary meals at their outlets in Neelankarai and Cenotaph Road. “Quite a few families passing by stopped for a bite. A lot of cyclists and two-wheeler riders came in too for a quick hot meal,” says Japtej. With the inner roads of Neelankarai flooding, more people ended up in that outlet. Maggi was the most popular dish followed by burgers and sandwiches.

Old Madras Baking Company (OMBC) too welcomed wet stranded passersby for a hot cup of tea/coffee and some sandwiches at all their outlets. Sandy’s, Ox and Tomato and OMBC are open to accommodating people to spend the night there as well. “On Tuesday night about six people spent the night at Sandy’s in Ganapathy Colony,” says Mansi Sandesh Reddy. Tryst cafe put together food boxes to be dispatched to people in need.

VOICES

Anita Ratnam, classical and contemporary dancer-choreographer

Her house is full of people; just waking up to steaming cups of tea after a long, frightening night. “I was on my way to the airport with a group of ten dancers yesterday to catch a flight to Thailand for a contemporary dance festival. We got into the car at 8 p.m., and eventually gave up because we could not access the airport. We got home at midnight, and on the way I saw eight to nine people huddled under a big tree outside my house. It was terrible,” says Anita.

She responded by opening her home to as many people as she could house, a total of 18, including all the dancers. “I also handed out everything I could: towels, blankets, T-shirts… I completely cleaned out the fridge,” she says, “We slept on every available surface, just using cushions, quilts and all my shawls… I didn’t think about it, I just did it. And that’s how the city is responding to the rain.”

She adds, “We are part of a momentous disaster. Whatever we can do, we do. At least this rain has shown one thing about our city: we are extremely hospitable: warm, welcoming and trusting. I’m not surprised people are opening their homes. Remember in Tamil custom we never say goodbye – we say ‘vaanga’, please come.”

“I would have loved to see the glittering establishments of this city throw open their lobbies as well. When 9/11 happened in New York, all the five star hotels ran ads saying, ‘Please come in’. They opened soup kitchens. Here it is the individual citizens who are reflective of the spirit of the city. It is in crisis that character emerges.”

Sam Paul, lawyer and entrepreneur

On Tuesday, as flood waters rose in and around Chennai, Sam Paul rounded a group of friends and family members and started a rescue service. They split into teams and went about rescuing marooned families, supplying food, medicine and offering shelter. Sam’s house as of now is hosting four families. “We rescued a family from Perambur where the water level was 12 feet. Two grandparents and a grandson. We even rescued a dog. Our friends too have opened up their houses for those stranded,” he says.

Till about 7.30 am on Wednesday Sam, Lenin Paul, Ajit Sigamani and Jose Sigamani drove through Mudichur, Velachery, Guduvanchery, Madipakkam and Tambaram getting stranded people out.

Pleased with how people from the city are banding together to lend support, Sam says activist Abdul Ghani and his team too are doing good work. “They even rescued a pregnant woman, who was then admitted to SRM hospital where she delivered a baby,” he says.

In addition Sam’s restaurant chain of Jonah’s is cooking and supplying food for 300 people.

The initiative has grown with more people joining in as volunteers and shortly a Facebook page titled Chennai food, rescue and shelter will be up to spread the message and services.

“Our Covelong boys team helped the stranded during the floods by using whatever was available such as kayaks, catamarans and fishing boats.

There were, of course, hundreds of images, as everyone turned newsmen and captured the agony and pain of hundreds of Chennaities on their mobile phones. The story that each picture, be it of students of Satyabama University coming out on a boat or of buses submerged in a subway, is one that screams, “You asked for it!”

Now let’s look at this rationally. The North East monsoon which brings rain to Chennai during the winter months is not always bountiful. In fact, weathermen agree that it is only once is ten years that Chennai gets enough rain to flood the city. The rest of time, people pray for rain as ground water levels deplete and water trucks whizz around delivering water to apartment complexes, villas and tenements.

But last week it was different. In the first 24 hours the city received 246 mm of rainfall breaking the 1976 record when Madras (as the city was called then) received 452 mm of rain. On November 23, however, Chennaities had a really raw deal. The rain came down in buckets and brought the city to its knees. Commutes which normally take about 25 minutes took hours, mainly because the roads were flooded and people panicked because of the rumours spread by social media that a lake had breached. At 8.30 pm, the rain gauge at Meenambakkam recorded 97 mm of rain and Nungambakkam recorded 92 mm.

Those of us who loved the city see what a mess Chennai has become and are saddened. Some years ago, at seminars, wise men pontificated of the dangers of building the Mass Rapid Transit System on the Buckingham Canal, of constructions on the Pallikaranai marshlands and of locating the Information Technology corridor on a water body. But the constructions continued nevertheless. Gated communities as well as special economic zones have come up in areas which should have been catchments areas. Temple tanks which refueled the ground water through centuries have been concreted. Tenements and apartment complexes have come up on the flood plains of the rivers.

Take the case of Ponneri, a small town located in the Chennai Metropolitan Area and one designated to be a Smart City. Ponneri received 370 mm of rain, almost 100 mm more than Chennai city. Construction is on going with no particular attention paid to drainage. Pulicat and Ennore are sad stories. The unique eco system with mangroves and intertidal zones will all be a thing of the past. Pulicat is also of historical value. But who cares?

Residents of Chennai have experienced real misery as every suburb and subway turned into waterways. A disastrous cocktail of sewerage and rain water entered homes bringing with it promises of deadly disease, snakes and scorpions. In many parts of South Chennai, the water was almost five feet in depth, especially those which have been constructed on marshes and swamps. Experts point out the Second Master Plan by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority has paid no attention to hydrology.

The National Institute of Disaster Management reports that in Chennai, 650 water bodies, which include lakes, ponds, and storage tanks, have been destroyed. Today, sadly, there are just 27 water bodies. The worst news is that the city has only 855 km of storm drains for the 2,847 km of roads.

Another tragedy is the fact that there is no storage infrastructure to harvest the rain water. What makes this a tragedy is that Tamil Nadu is drought prone and has an ongoing quarrel with neigbouring states for water.

The main cause, however, for the flooding has been the blatant disregard for ecology by the caucus of politicians, civil servants and developers. Swamps and wet lands such as Pallikarani have been reclaimed to accommodate high rise buildings. The case in point is of Taramani and Velachery, two areas which are waterlogged in the event of rain. Phoenix Mall, the largest mall in Chennai, is on a lake bed!

More alarm bells are ringing. The Chennai floods could be the consequence of climate change, opines one expert. If it is so there is a need to make, not just Chennai, but all our cities more resilient to climate change.

Now what is done is done, will the city planners please wake up.

(Source: PTI)

With truck-loads of relief material reaching rain-ravaged Chennai, the city faced a problem — a lack of coordination between government agencies and independent relief teams.

Hundreds of volunteers working with different organisations, and even individuals offering help in Chennai, its suburbs and other northern districts — including Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur and Cuddalore — were found extending help with little clue about the locations that actually needed it the most.

“The government machinery remains inadequate in trying to figure out the ground situation. They need to tell us about the precise ground situation so that we can reach there. In many places, relief has already reached. In some cases, volunteers told me about incidents where they found people selling sanitary napkins they received in excess. When hundreds of independent volunteers are making their efforts to help people, we have no source of information on places without any flood as we have been depending on unverified information. It would have been great had the government shared their precise information on flood-affected people,” said a leading actor, who did not wish to be named.

The Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, which was serving as the government’s main relief centre, and hundreds of other independent centres collecting relief material remained disconnected.

“Had there been a media centre and frequent briefing from the government on the status of flood-hit areas and the relief work, it would have been great for hundreds of relief workers,” said a volunteer.

A top official admitted that the limited media briefing, meant to avoid spreading “bad news”, was eventually leading to rumours, which in turn impacted government efforts.

Also, truck-loads of relief material from other cities and states were left without any valid destination for delivery and distribution as the government had not opened any collection centre or taken any measures for coordinate their dispatch.

A senior official told The Indian Express that the government’s focus was on rescue operations till Saturday and all nodal offices across districts and nodal points would be ready by Monday to receive relief and help.

So far, more than 1.27 lakh people have been evacuated from the inundated areas, with over 10,000 being rescued in the last two days, according to official estimates.

While around 62,200 people have been sheltered at 97 government-run relief camps in Chennai city, the conditions posed a health threat because of a lack of adequate number of toilets.

While a shelter in Tambaram that housed over 3,000 people had around 20 mobile toilets, a camp in Pulianthope with some 800 people had seven toilets available inside the school premises that housed it.

Semmencherry, in the city’s suburb that houses over 15,000 people relocated from slums over several years, also faced serious threat of water contamination reportedly due to sewage lines getting mixed with storm water drains.

A top official monitoring relief operations said the government had so far distributed over 14.5 lakh food packets in Chennai alone.

By Sunday afternoon, over 40,000 people had been screened at 141 health camps and 99 mobile camps being run by the city corporation. According to the government’s assessment, nearly 436 areas in the city still remained inundated out of the total 859 identified during the past four days.

The last century have shown that there were several catastrophic flooding in Chennai in 1943, 1978, 1985, 2002 and 205 caused by heavy rain associated with cyclonic activity.

Flooding of lesser magnitude occurs regularly in low-lying areas of Chennai and its suburbs because of inoperativeness of the local drainage infrastructure

Chennai had been warned by the Met department in mid-October this year that it could see very heavy rainfall of the kind that could cause flooding.The India Meteorological Department or IMD had, on October 16, forecast a very wet last quarter, saying that the seasonal rainfall was likely to be more than 112 per cent of the long period average for Tamil Nadu, which it assessed at 43.82 centimetres.Any forecast of over 10 per cent extra rainfall over the normal is considered flooding.The ""forecast outlook for 2015 North East Monsoon Season"" was issued almost a month before unprecedented rains first lashed Chennai and adjoining areas, causing floods that seem to have caught the local authorities totally off-guard.""I am only a meteorologist and not a town planner,"" said IMD Director General LS Rathore, confirming that the weather office had indeed warned that there could be excess rain which could cause flooding.Mr Rathore said the region is ""super-saturated"" with water, with rain in catchments flowing down to the sea along the rivers, causing the floods in Chennai.Experts say town planners should follow up such forecasts by de-silting drains, cleaning storm water drains, ensuring there are no encroachments and putting in place emergency plans for communications and essential supplies.On December 2nd, the worst day of flooding in Chennai, the city received 34.5 cm of rainfall.

By the time Bijoy was taken to the ICU of the neighbouring Ramachandra Medical Institute, he was already dead, said doctors who coordinated the evacuation of patients marooned at MIOT Hospital in Manapakkam. “Around 18 patients from the critical care unit died due to the lack of an oxygen supply system following power failure,” said Dr Umesh Kumar, a physician who has been at MIOT Hospital for over seven years.

For patients, doctors and nurses at one of Chennai’s premier hospitals, life became hell for over 48 hours as flood water hit power, food supply, communication lines and road access.

Doctors and paramedical staff manually pumped oxygen (ambu bagging) for nearly 48 hours for critically ill patients after oxygen supply got cut off Tuesday night as flood water knocked off the back-up power generator located in the basement of one of three buildings that make up the hospital.

With the canteen located in the basement flooded as well, patients, attendants and hospital staff lived on biscuits and anything edible they could get their hands, said Dr Okorie, a paediatrician from Nigeria, whose seven-month-old son was on the mend at the hospital after he underwent an open heart surgery a few days ago.

While the patient count at the hospital stood at 575, spread over three buildings and nearly 20 floors, on Tuesday evening, it was down to around 60 patients — all on the third floor of the main building — by Friday morning. With power supply yet to be restored, the hospital wore a deserted look and the basement remained flooded with water from the Adyar river. A power generator rented by the hospital was being readied to supply power to remaining patients.

“Our patient strength was 575 on Tuesday but most of the patients have been moved out,” said Dr Kumar.

“We were on back-up power from Tuesday after the main power supply stopped. Late on Tuesday, water surged into the basement and the generator. This ruptured oxygen supply. For 48 hours, we manually ventilated critical patients like those with kidney failure,” said a visibly tired Dr Kumar. “I have been here for four days.”

The decision to move patients was taken only on Thursday afternoon, according to details provided by doctors with whom MIOT doctors coordinated. At the Ramachandra Medical Institute, where children from the MIOT cardio thoracic ICU were moved, the first patients arrived around 3.30 pm Thursday afternoon.

A total of 23 patients from MIOT were moved to Ramachandra Institute, while 11 infants of international origin, including Dr Okorie’s son, were moved to the Madras Medical Mission.

“It is an act of nature which they were not prepared for. I was at the hospital through the whole thing. Their power supply got blown off and, as a doctor, I know you cannot sustain ambu bagging for too long. Also, monitors providing vitals of patients were not working and this is disastrous in a modern hospital,” said Dr Okorie.

Many hospital staffers did not speak to their family for four days because phone lines were down. “I just got through to my family…they are safe,” said a young MIOT nurse, sobbing at the reception of the Madras Medical Mission hospital.

One of the decisions MIOT had to make was whether it wanted to move critical patients through flooded streets when the power back-up went kaput. “It is a tough call and sometimes it is better for a critical patient to stay put,” said a senior anaesthetist with a Chennai hospital where some patients from MIOT were taken.

“We tried to call for help and back-up power but phone lines were down. The roads to the hospital were also under six feet of water, making evacuation difficult,” said Dr Kumar.

With communication lines still down across Chennai, many hospitals have resorted to old-fashioned paging service on the hospital public address systems to reach out to doctors and staff when required.

Meanwhile, relatives of patients left behind at MIOT are unsure whether to move their kin out. “My 73-year-old father underwent an open heart surgery last Friday. He has stabilised and doctors at MIOT have said we don’t have to move him. We were supposed to visit him on Thursday but the roads were flooded and the hospital was cut off,” said Sujata, daughter of Radhakrishnan.

Among the heart-warming stories to have emerged from the Chennai floods is a cleaning drive undertaken by a Muslim organisation.

Around 50 members of Jammat E Islami Hind, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), have been quietly cleaning mosques as well as temples in the flood-hit areas of the city.

In the last two days, they meticulously cleaned two temples, in Kotturpuram and Saidapet. “We find Hindus are unable to worship at temples in some areas because they have been severely affected owing to floods. So, we cleaned the mosques and temples and the streets badly damaged in the two areas. In the coming week, we will do similar work in other areas of the city,” Peer Mohammed, postgraduate in engineering and a student wing secretary (social service) of Jammat E Islami Hind, said. “Throughout the process, people there helped us and were very happy that the cleaning was done,” he added.

Jalaludeen, secretary of the group, said they took utmost care while cleaning the temples in both areas.

Home to over 165 BSE-listed companies (registered in Chennai) with an aggregate market capitalisation of over Rs 285,000 crore, the city is one of the biggest business centres in the country and the floods have caused major loss for companies as they were forced to shut their production facilities and operations were halted at IT hubs. Initial estimates suggest that the financial losses from the torrential rains and floods in Tamil Nadu may exceed Rs 15,000 crore.

The well-established presence of the automobile industry around the city include factories of Hyundai, Ford, BMW, Nissan, TVS, Renault-Nissan and Ashok Leyland, most of which were forced to shut production.

Commercial vehicle manufacturer Ashok Leyland has a plant at Ennore near Chennai, which accounts for about 40 per cent of the company’s production that span 18-seater to 82-seater double-decker buses and 7.5 tonne to 49 tonne haulage vehicles.

Hyundai Motor India Ltd’s facility in Sriperumbudur near Chennai has two plants producing 680,000 units between them. “Hyundai Motor India decided not to operate all three shifts today (Wednesday) and the first shift tomorrow (Thursday). This is the situation as of December 2, 5 PM and we are monitoring the situation,” HMIL said.

Ford with an annual capacity of 3.4 lakh engines and 2 lakh vehicles has also shut its plant down. “Continued heavy rains in Chennai have resulted in significant flooding in the area with many roads impassable. For the safety of our employees, we have halted production at our Chennai assembly and engine plants on Wednesday. We are monitoring the situation and will return to normal operations as soon as conditions improve… Most employees come from some distance away and so our primary focus is their safety. In all, we’ve had about three and a half days of shutdown,” a Ford India executive said.

The BMW Group too shut down production at its Chennai plant. In its statement, the BMW Group said, “Heavy rainfall has severely affected employee transportation in Chennai since December 1, 2015. Due to which BMW Plant in Chennai will not be able to undertake any production activities during December 1-4, 2015.”

TVS Motor Company, which is based in Chennai, had reported that over the last three weeks, the company suffered sales loss of approximately 15,000 units due to inclement weather. Delhi-based dealer for Renault-Nissan said that dealerships have been forewarned of the possibility of disruptions in shipments in the coming weeks on account of the current disruption in production.

“The financial loss due to record-breaking rainfall in Chennai and several parts of Tamil Nadu may even exceed Rs 15,000 crore mark as Chennai has come to a virtual standstill and is in the grip of fear and panic,” Assocham said on Wednesday.

As the flood water recedes in Chennai, serious questions are being raised about reservoir management in the city. Much of the flooding and subsequent waterlogging was a consequence of the outflows from major reservoirs into swollen rivers and into the city following heavy rains. The release of waters from the Chembarambakkam reservoir in particular has received much attention.

Official data from the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board for the last 20 days suggest that the high precipitation and reservoir outflows on November 16 and December 1 respectively were primarily responsible for swelling the rivers. On November 17, 18,000 cusecs was released from the reservoir in Chembarambakkam.

However, from November 24 to November 30, when the city experienced minimal rainfall, the outflows from the reservoir were limited, even as the storage levels were maintained at almost 85-88% of the total capacity of 3645 mcft. When heavy rains to the tune of nearly 48 cm fell on the reservoir on December 1, 29,000 cusecs was released over 12 hours.

Experts raise the question as to why storage was set at such high levels. Professor Janakarajan of the Madras Institute of Development Studies also argues that the outflow management from the reservoir was improper. If storage levels were set at less than 75% and sluice gates were opened to allow for outflow from the reservoir in a way that it exceeded the inflows in the last week of November, the blow in the form of the high outflow on December 1 could have been softened, he asserts.

Officials formerly with the PWD say if the risk of releasing a particular volume prior to the heavy rainfall day had been taken, there would have been lesser floods in places like K.K.Nagar.

It is reliably learnt that the government is considering a move to further reduce the set storage level in the reservoir. Now the level is at two feet below the brim, and discussions are under way to change this to four feet.

Reservoir managers ignored warnings of heavy downpour

On November 17, 18,000 cusecs was released from the reservoir in Chembarambakkam, causing massive flooding in areas such as Mudichur, West Tambaram, and Manapakkam among others.

However, from November 24 to November 30, when the city experienced minimal rainfall, the outflows from the reservoir were limited. Officials in the Public Works Department asserted that the inflow of 31,000 cusecs (26,000 before 6:00 p.m. owing to the high rainfall) resulted in the high outflow of 29,000 cusecs from the reservoir on December 1 and that they couldn’t hold the reservoir beyond a point.

Former officials of the department, however, said if they had taken the risk of releasing a particular volume from the reservoir prior to the heavy rainfall day, water received from some tanks like Porur and Mudichur could have been stored.

The decision to conservatively hold storage despite early warnings from various meteorological agencies about heavy rainfall in the offing in late November and early December, clearly exacerbated the disaster that followed.

This was in addition to the structural issues in Chennai with floodplains and drainage systems being constrained by unplanned urbanisation.

Storage levels in Chembarambakkam and other reservoirs are decided based on drinking water requirements for the city and other areas in summer.

That the authorities should have hedged on the side of flood management over concerns on drinking water is now evident in hindsight.

As the waters begin to recede and the sun peeks out, doctors in the city are starting to see a huge number of skin infections, fevers and diarrhoea cases.

At hospitals across the city, fungal and bacterial skin infections, allergies, viral diseases and loose stools are filling up outpatient sections.

“We’ve seen a drastic increase in these cases. Most are allergies and viral infections caused by contaminated water. Boil-like lesions, abscesses on the head and fungal infections are also coming in, along with the usual number of dengue cases,” Padma Appaji, consultant paediatrician, Vijaya Group of Hospitals. She added that the hospital saw at least 25 cases of loose stools every day.

Medical college hospitals that have been conducting mobile health camps across the city from Sunday, are also seeing a lot of skin ailments. “Most of the patients have sores on their feet from having waded through water. We are seeing a lot of colds, coughs, fevers, vomiting and diarrhoea,” said T. Ravindran, professor of medicine, Government Kilpauk Hospital, which, along with Government Royapettah Hospital, is conducting 40 camps a day.

Respiratory infections too are doing the rounds, said doctors at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, which held 40 camps and saw over 6,000 people on Sunday, primarily in the southern suburbs.

Fever camps in these hospitals too were seeing between 80 and 150 patients a day, doctors said.

“Apart from the infections, there are also injuries — from sharp objects in the water that people cannot see. There is also a lot of concern about leptospirosis and other waterborne diseases, though as of now, we have not seen any cases.

The lack of warning of the impending floods in Chennai made it especially difficult for people with disabilities, who were left to fend for themselves. While some needed rescuing, others lost essential implements like hearing aids, crutches and calipers, leaving them more vulnerable than ever before.

The disaster, however, did bring to the fore incredible stories of courage and grit, where ordinary citizens became heroes as they helped save lives.

One such story is that of physically challenged teacher K.S. Mariappan, who rescued four mentally challenged students from a special school as water gushed into the campus.

December 1 seemed like just another rainy night to the students at the Annai Special School, located on the banks of the Adyar river in Saidapet. The inmates had retired to bed after dinner, as had Mariappan, who also lived on the school premises.

Around 9 p.m., Pratap, one of the students who noticed the water seeping into the school, rushed to Mr. Mariappan’s quarters to wake him up.

Jolted into action, Mr. Mariappan took a call to move the students out of the school to the home of a teacher who lived a kilometre away. By the time they had collected a few essentials and started out of the school on Mr. Mariappan’s retro-fitted bike, the water in the school campus was ankle-deep. Since he suffers from polio, and depends on his crutches to move about, the swirling waters posed a huge challenge for Mr. Marippan, especially as he had to escort others to safety.

“To reach the house, we walked around half a kilometre. Walking through the flooded streets on my crutches meant that the progress was slow, and I had to accompany each student individually,” he said.

After he escorted the last student, Subhash, to safety, Mr. Marippan went back to his bike to collect the certificates and other essentials that he had managed to save from the water. “By this time the flood waters had reached my chest, and I could no longer walk through the swirling waters. I somehow managed to hold on to my crutches, but I had to be carried by bystanders to prevent me from being washed away,” he explains.

For the next three days, the group was forced to live with one of the teachers, with very little food, almost no medical care, and two special instructors to manage four distressed students.

A similarly harrowing situation played out in Nandambakkam, where the students of MGR School for Hearing Impaired were stranded on their campus, and were rescued by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Many of the students lost their hearing aids and certificates.

Official figures state that 11.7 lakh persons with disabilities live in the State (around 1.7 per cent of the population). Estimates suggest that the Chennai metropolitan area alone has over 1.5 lakh disabled people. About two months ago, Vidyasagar, a city NGO working with the disabled, wrote a letter to the State Disaster Management Authority headed by the Chief Secretary, asking it to include the needs of people with disabilities when making a disaster management plan.

“The letter, which was sent in October, asked that persons with disabilities be included on the panel of the authority so that they could better explain the issues faced during natural disasters,” Smitha Sadasivam from Vidyasagar said. So far, there has been no response from the authority.

In a disturbing coincidence, the floods ravaged the city soon after the letter was sent, and seemed to only emphasise the need to include the disabled when coming up with a strategy for disaster management.

The case of Bhavana, who has cerebral palsy and lives in Sriram Nagar Colony with her parents and caregiver, is one example which highlights the crucial need for rescue teams to have adequate training to deal with people with special needs.

Bhavana is wheelchair-bound, and is unable to speak. When the river water started flooding her house, her caregiver managed to signal for a boat to rescue them. But when the team arrived, they realised that Bhavana would have to be transported in her wheelchair. One of the members of the rescue team says, “After trying several different methods, we had to ask her mother and her caregiver to wade through the water and help carry her on to the boat, since none of us had the training needed to undertake such an operation.” The fact that civilian-led rescue teams, even though they meant only good had no experience to anticipate such situations, compounded rescue efforts.

Amba Salelkar of Inclusive Planet Centre for Disability Law and Policy, emphasises the need for disaster management policies to ensure people who are visually or hearing impaired receive warning messages, and that people with mobility impediments are rescued. Only then will these policies be comprehensive, she says.

Trapped in the floods

While people in danger were rescued from their homes, a majority of the city remained indoors for a few days, with telephone lines failing, no electricity and the streets continuing to be flooded with water.

Many of the inmates of Vidyasagar were in a similar situation. With no electricity, and many of the people on wheelchairs, they were all forced to stay on the third floor of the school building. This dealt a blow especially to those who got around using electronic wheelchairs, which could not be charged, due to the prolonged blackout in the area. As a result, they were unable to even use the toilet without someone carrying them. Since there were very few caregivers, the situation became dire.

Medical care for people with special needs also became a problem during the floods. Ms. Sadasivam herself was stranded in her house with viral fever. “I have multiple sclerosis, and I am on immunosuppressants, which means that I cannot take many over-the-counter medicines,” she explains.

Attempts at rebuilding Now that much of the water has receded, the focus is on the city and its people trying to rebuild themselves. K. Manivasan, Commissioner, Disabilities, government of Tamil Nadu, says, “The government has ensured that all the camps have a special officer who is taking care of people with disabilities. Wherever possible, we are issuing certificates immediately.”

A disaster that was termed as a leveller, in terms of its effect on people of all social classes, was still a great deal harder on people with disabilities, who have, in the past, lobbied for better accessibility in the city. Activists and people with disabilities alike hope that the floods, disastrous as it was, would jolt the government into finally taking their cause more seriously.

They say that of late, the city has been witnessing floods even during medium rains, which is a cause for alarm as the city might go the Chennai way during heavy rainfall.

Geographically, the city of Pune lies in a valley with many small and medium streams meandering down its area to empty at the Mula-Mutha basin. In their study, researchers Tushar Shitole, principal of Mamasaheb Mohol college, and Shrikant Gabale, a PhD scholar, have identified six major basins that are active in and around the city – Ramnadi, Ambil Odha, Nandusi, Bhairoba nala, Wadki nala and Wagholi nala.

A natural water stream is the path rainwater takes to drain into bigger water bodies. Using topographical sheets and Google earth imagery, the researchers have studied almost all the basins and the results are disturbing.

Ramnadi Basin

Back in 2010, the tiny river of Ramnadi was in the news for the havoc its flash floods created in the Baner-Bavdhan area, leaving 11 people dead. The public outrage in its aftermath prompted authorities to say they would raze illegal encroachments as well as demarcate red and blue flood lines for the river. While majority of the encroachments were pulled down, the demarcation of red and blue flood lines (construction within these lines is not allowed) is yet to happen.

During the course of their research, Shitole and Gabale found that almost 20 per cent of the secondary streams draining in Ramnadi had vanished and the width of the stream had reduced by almost 15 per cent. Of the 416 streams draining into the Ramnadi, 106 have vanished while the rest are at threat of disappearing due to the construction boom in the area.

Along with Ramnadi, the tiny river of Devnadi in the neighbouring Baner area has also been under a lot of stress due to encroachment.

Local residents had even moved a PIL in the Bombay High Court the problem. Anupam Saraph of the Baner Balewadi Area Sabha said that although the High Court had asked for removal of sewage lines and debris from the area, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had failed to do so. “The rivers are the lifelines in maintaining the water cycle in the area. Since the civic body has taken up channelisation work which involves concretisation of Devnadi, the wells have dried up in the area. Incidents of heavy rains invariably leads to flooding as the water is neither able to seep into the ground nor able to flow along the body of the river,” Saraph said.

Ambil Odha basin

In June 2013, flash floods near Shindewadi on National Highway 4 washed away a woman and her child. According to Gabale, the flash floods in this region were caused due to the closure of the waterways in the upper reaches of the rivulet Ambil Odha, which happens to one of the most important tributaries of the Mutha river. With 40 per cent of the first-order streams of the Ambil Odha lost forever, the researchers say, danger of flash floods in this area remains real. “These are the waterways which the rainwater take for surface run-off and their disappearance is dangerous for the local hydrology of the area and can lead to flash floods,” says Gabale. The district administration had taken up the issue of removing unauthorised construction in the area but the threat of flash floods still remains.

Wagholi-Kharadi basin

The heavy rains which lashed the city towards November-end caused deep distress for residents of Lohegaon, Dhanori and nearby areas. Waterlogging was reported from numerous areas, causing severe damage to vehicles and property. This area, home to huge construction boom, has also seen some of the largest loss of water streams.

Local resident Sameer Patil talks about how they had to pull down a compound wall as the water level was fast accumulating there. “Even during moderate rains, water-logging is a problem in the area. However, when it started raining continuously, the water level was fast increasing. We had no other way but to pull down the wall to allow the water to flow through,” he says.

This, town planners and geographers say, was a clear sign of the vanishing water streams in the area. In the Wagholi basin area, 34.78 per cent of the streams have vanished due to unplanned growth. Similarly, the Bhairoba Nala and Wadki Nala, which traverse through Hadapsar and its neighbourhood areas, have lost 22.73 and 16.56 per cent of their streams. With construction boom continuing unchecked in these areas, locals fear a Chennai-like situation here.

“There is no space left for the water to drain out due to construction of embankment walls. The magnitude of flooding can be reduced by allowing channels for the water to pass through,” Shitole says.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

As the water level in several low lying areas have receded, the Central and state government agencies have undertaken relief measures on a war footing.

The Tamil Nadu government has taken steps to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential commodities. Milk supply, which had remained erratic last week, was almost restored completely.

For supply of vegetables the government has opened shops retailing vegetables at cheaper rates.

As there has been erratic supply of fuel and LPG cylinders in city and its neighbourhood, the country’s largest oil marketing company Indian Oil Corporation was operating its plants in full swing for meeting the demand.

Several NGOs and volunteers of various organisations have also taken relief efforts as the focus is now more on spread of epidemic.

Government doctors were visiting severely affected areas to distribute medicine for the residents to safeguard themselves against diarrhoea and other water-borne infections.

As piles of garbage lie in several low lying areas, authorities and various NGO were engaged in clearing it.

Corporation of Chennai and other civic bodies have deployed scores of workers to clear debris from the affected areas. The state government has brought in workers from other districts for this purpose.

Educational institutions in Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallore remained closed for today also.

The transport system was back to normal with public transport buses plying in all places while rail and air services have been restored since yesterday.

Health Secretary J Radhakrishnan said on Friday that an inquiry will be conducted into the tragedy at the MIOT International hospital, which took the official death toll in flood-related incidents to 280.

The announcement came as rains eased on Friday, raising hopes that rescue efforts could pick up in Chennai.

Parts of the flat, coastal city in the state of Tamil Nadu remained under as much as 2.5m of water for a fourth day.

Many residents have spent days stranded on rooftops since more than 345mm of rain fell over 24 hours on December 1.

Despite combined rescue efforts by the military and civilian emergency services, help has yet to reach many areas. Residents were angered by reports that authorities had released water from brimming lakes without much warning.

“The authorities didn’t give us adequate information about water being released from a nearby lake. Before we could take action my car had sunk and I had to move to the first floor of my apartment,” said V Raghunathan, 60, a manager at an interior design company living in southern Chennai.

The Tamil Nadu public works department said it did issue warnings, but the information apparently did not reach the public because of a breakdown in media and phone communications. The Chennai edition of The Hindu newspaper did not go to press on Thursday, apparently for the first time in 137 years.

Facing criticism for its handling of the crisis, senior Tamil Nadu officials defended the government at a press conference at the state’s water-logged headquarters on Friday evening.

They said authorities have so far evacuated 127,580 people. More than half of them from banks of rivers are now sheltered in relief camps and are being treated for fever and infections to prevent an epidemic.

Military helicopters dropped food to residents stranded on rooftops and the defence ministry doubled to 4,000 the number of soldiers deployed to help the rescue effort.

The heaviest downpour in a century has led to a never seen before outpouring of support on social media platforms for those battling the Chennai floods . From politicians to companies, ordinary netizens, celebrities, startup and ecommerce founders, people are doing their bit to help those in distress. With #ChennaiFloods trending on Twitter on Wednesday, companies like Airtel Zomato and Paytm announced relief efforts.Users responded by volunteering to help people recharge their numbers through their account balance. In a tweet, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi urged party workers to extend all possible assistance to those affected by rains and floods. Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: “Spoke to Jayalalithaa ji on the flood situation in parts of Tamil Nadu. Assured all possible support & cooperation in this unfortunate hour”.Google’s crisis response live feed, which had information on relief centres, crowd-sourced flood resources and emergency helpline numbers also generated a lot of conversations and discussions with netizens increasingly tweeting the Google crisis response link. Shankar, a user tweeted: “Great humanitarian work harnessing the power of technology. Thanks to Google too. Keep going!”. By Wednesday evening, Chennairains.org, a crowdsourced list of people and places offering shelter, had been updated with a form to input details of food being offered and more information to look at. While Airtel offered a minimum balance of Rs 30 to Chennai users, Zomato invited people to buy a meal for two for Chennai to help get food to areas affected by the floods. “For every Chennai flood relief meal you buy, we will buy one and have them delivered to those in need,” it said. Founder Deepinder Goyal updated users on Twitter, saying about 15,000 meals had been bought by users for Chennai till around 4pm.“Zomato adds to it to make it 30,000. Let’s all help get to 100k – we can do this”, he added on Twitter. Aishwarya Rao, a Twitter user from Sydney, has started a ‘Go-Fundme’ campaign to raise money for flood relief. Actor Siddharth took to the streets to help with on ground efforts and kept sharing updates and queries on requirements on social media.

For the third consecutive day power, transport and telephone facilities were affected due to the rains.

A one litre packet of milk was being sold for ₹100 in some places while vegetables like tomato and beans were being sold at ₹80 to ₹90 per kg.

As the state electricity board had suspended power as a precautionary measure, most of the residents of the city and its neighbourhoods, who had stocked on milk and vegetables were unable to preserve them for long.

Large queues were seen in places where milk was being sold while the famous Koyambedu vegetable market was cut off from the city, leading to the spiralling vegetable prices.

The price of mineral water also hit the roof with a 20 litre bottle normally available for ₹30 being sold for ₹150 per bottle.

Most of the supermarkets and hotels across the city were either shut or had run out of stocks.

Unprecedented heavy rains and flooding, triggered by north east monsoon and a low pressure in Bay of Bengal, during the last several days has heaped misery on several districts in Tamil Nadu, especially Chennai.

Many areas in Chennai and its suburbs have submerged, bringing life to a halt.

The heaviest rainfall recorded in a century wreaked havoc in Chennai, where the city’s natural drainage system has been impaired by unrestrained construction along river banks and wetlands.

Experts said problems of poor urban planning and rampant development are not unique to Chennai, and are a warning to other cities.

On December 1, Chennai recorded 345 millimeters (13.5 inches) of rain in a 24-hour period.

Prasanth Elango, 22, was fast asleep when water gushed into his ground-floor apartment. ""It was full of rubbish and sewage, and three to four dead bodies also came in my friend’s area. ... The water was coming from all the streets,” he said.

Lakes, wetlands filled

With such rainfall, experts said they are not surprised that India’s fourth-largest city turned into a series of islands.

Over the past 15 years, dozens of wetlands and lakes have been filled to build malls, residential areas and business parks in Chennai, a thriving industrial hub and information technology center that is home to more than 6 million people.

Nityanand Jayaraman, a Chennai-based social activist and writer, points out that one of the worst affected areas is Velachery, a thriving residential area that mushroomed on what was once a large lake area after the city’s technology industry boom.

“Between 2005 and 2015, this place has a mass rapid transit system, a railway station that has been constructed upon the marshland,"" Jayaraman said. ""There has been a vast profusion of buildings that have sprouted up over there to accommodate software workers in gated communities, and now we find that most of these things are under water, and most of the software workers have gone back home.""

He said the area did not suffer the same fate during heavy rains in 2005 because it was not as thickly populated.

Chennai is not the only city brought to its knees by a heavy deluge.

Ten years ago, the financial hub of Mumbai faced a similar catastrophe after being lashed by 944 millimeters (37 inches) of rain. Last year, Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir in the Himalayan mountains, found itself under meters (feet) of water after being deluged by heavy rains.

Unregulated construction

In both cases, urban planners pointed at silting, unregulated construction, and encroachments along lakes and water bodies, which pushed the water into city neighborhoods.

City planners warn that much of the urbanization of India is happening on areas not suitable for construction, such as in flood plains.

Kapil Gupta of the Indian Institute of Technology Mumbai convened India’s first panel on urban flooding, which was set up in the wake of the Mumbai floods.

“There has been unplanned construction and the drainage of these areas has not been planned. Our urban centers need to be protected. We are spending so much on infrastructure, but we need to spend on drainage also and, obviously, we need to leave sufficient path for the rainfall so that our activities are not paralyzed,” Gupta said.

Urban planners are ringing alarm bells as climate experts warn that global warming is likely to result in more extreme weather.

India’s mega cities are already home to millions of people. By 2050, 1 billion people are expected to live in urban areas.

This high-density population would put millions at risk when cities are devastated by flooding.

The Chennai floods have taken a heavy toll -- more than 280 people have died since November and industries have pegged losses at over $20 billion.

Drainage issue

Despite those figures, Shashidhar Reddy, former vice chairman of India’s National Disaster Management Authority, said stormwater drainage remains a low priority for city officials.

""Unlike the roads, which are getting widened to accommodate more traffic, the capacities of the drains have diminished because of encroachments, because of silting, and that is true to every city in India,"" Reddy said.

He said, on average, the capacity of stormwater drains need to be more than doubled.

After facing colossal losses, Chennai residents are taking action.

For a straight 15 hours on Tuesday, torrential rains pounded Chennai, causing the Chembarambakkam lake to overflow its banks, and leading to a deluge of near-Biblical proportions, the likes of which, say old-timers, hasn’t been seen in the past 100 years.Between 8.30 a.m. and 11.30 p.m., the city recorded 236 mm rainfall, the heaviest rainfall since 2005 October in a single day. And yet, the rains show little sign of easing up.The volume of rain is clearly way more than the city can handle, and way more than what the city has endured over the past fortnight, say reports.Making things worse was the inability of residents to access rescue teams provide by the state government, Ola Cabs, NTL, and others.Travellers are stranded as Chennai Airport has cancelled all flights for Wednesday due to flooding on the runway; a number of hotels are also refusing to extend guests’ stay.A senior official of an automobile company who was visiting from Mumbai said that he was supposed to take a Mumbai flight Wednesday afternoon. Now, not only has his flight been cancelled, but the hotel is also refusing to extend his stay.There are power outages in many parts of the city; mobile phone connectivity in various parts has also been hit, making it harder to residents to reach out for help.Business Standard also tried calling the numbers given by various departments, as well as those provided Ola Cabs, NTL and others, but all of them were continuously busy, suggesting that they, too, have been overwhelmed, either by callers or by the waters.In effect, the city has ground to a halt – schools, colleges, IT companies, factories and other commercial establishments are shut.And unlike the clouds, which have hung over the city for close to a fortnight now, there’s seems to be little good news on the horizon – weather forecasts say the rains are likely to continue for the next 24 hours at the least.Krishnan, an IT professional staying at Jaffarkhanpet, close to West Mambalam, in the heart of the city, told Business Standard that the water level in his house has increased since 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, forcing him to move to the second floor from the ground floor. His car, too, has been washed away by the floodwaters, and his attempts to reach rescue team have been unsuccessful so far.A number of people, especially those working in the city’s IT hub, remain stranded at their offices as roads have virtually turned into waterways. Similarly, at Mahindra World City, people are staying at guest houses inside the office complex. Even those who working and living within city limits have not been able to return home.Jaishankar, who works at Annasalai and stays about 5-6 km away at T. Nagar, said he had to stay back in office as all the connecting bridges and subways are inundated.

The worst floods in Jammu and Kashmir in the past 60 years and the subsequent devastation are due to a combination of unprecedented and intense rain, mismanagement, unplanned urbanisation and a lack of preparedness, Sunita Narain, director-general, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said on Wednesday.

A CSE analysis showed the floods were a manifestation of an extreme weather event linked to climate change. Ms. Narain said the changing rainfall pattern in India was part of extreme events which followed a trend. She called for a national action plan to forecast floods.

In an analysis of extreme events in India from 2005 to 2013, Chandra Bhushan, CSE deputy director-general, said the four events he studied — from the Mumbai floods in 2005 to the recent floods in Jammu and Kashmir — were either attributed to interaction between western disturbances and the monsoon system, excessive rain or freak unusual events; there was no mention of climate change.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests had expressed no opinion on the frequency of these extreme events, and there was complete silence on their link to climate change, Mr. Bhushan pointed out.

Extreme events In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fourth assessment report, said extreme rainfall events were set to increase over the Indian subcontinent. In its fifth assessment report, the IPCC said the intensity of rainfall in India would increase. A study by B.N. Goswami of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in 2006 had predicted changes in rainfall across India and especially over the Himalayan range, which would have a high impact in the region, apart from the west coast and central India.

The study of data between 1950 and 2000 showed that the incidence of heavy and very heavy rainfall (more than 100 mm and 150 mm/ a day) had increased and moderate rainfall decreased.

Jammu and Kashmir does not have a flood forecasting system, not even a separate disaster management plan, said Ms Narain. In 2004, a remote sensing data-based study of Jammu and Kashmir had shown that 55 per cent of wetlands, drainage channels and water bodies had been encroached upon. Ms Narain said Jammu and Kashmir had an intricate system of water management. The lake areas had diminished, the holding capacity of many water bodies had gone down, and houses were built in places they should never have been, she pointed out.

But encroachers need not worry. Both Chennai corporation and the public works department (PWD) vested with the powers to curb them have no action plan on clearing them this year prior to the monsoon, which is expected by next month.

The Chennai corporation last week conducted a pre-monsoon arrangement meet in which officials from the PWD, Chennai metro water and the police participated. Though the issue of encroachments was discussed, no detailed action plan was chalked out, a confidential source said.

“It is a fact that the width of Adyar river has narrowed down by more than 30 per cent and a few pockets like Ekattuthangal, Saidapet and Adyar are worse off. The drive by government officials over the past few years had only hit roadblocks due to political interventions,” said former chief engineer of Chennai corporation A. Swaminathan. Chennai has recorded floods once every five years, and only when there is flooding, the encroachments are cleared, not otherwise,” he added.

“According to the second master plan of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), several catastrophic floods were recorded in Chennai during 1978, 1985, 2002 and 2005, caused by heavy rain associated with cyclonic activities. Subsequently, many recommendations were made by the CMDA and environmentalists,” said former Chennai mayor M. Subramanian.

Further, he says during the previous DMK regime, encroachments were removed near Ekattuthangal and Saidapet, but at present, there is no such encroachment drive or initiatives to widen the Adyar river.

“The lack of required width to discharge flood waters due to the presence of patta lands within the flood plains of Adyar river has been a problem since the 1980s, particularly the stretch of the river between Nandambakkam and Manapakkam, which has several huge encroachments,” said Mr S. Thirunavukarasu, general secretary Neer Exnora. He added that recommendations like constructions of check dams, arrest of sewer lines and clearing of encroachments, were not done by the authorities for the past several years.

PWD sources confirmed that there were no major anti-encroachment drives planned along city water ways.

Bhubaneswar, Aug 7: With the situation continuing to remain grim in flood-hit Odisha, the toll in the inundation so far has risen to 34, an official said on Thursday. Seven more deaths were reported in the state taking the toll in rain- and flood-related incidents since July to 34, an official told IANS.

The water level in Mahanadi, Devi and Baitarani rivers continued to remain above the danger mark at some places, he said. Although flood waters had receded in some areas, the situation continued to remain grim in Bhadrak and Jajpur districts, among others, he added.

He said 241,658 residents of 398 villages were marooned. Also, 139,023 people were evacuated and 429 free kitchens were running to provide meals to those affected by the flood. As many as 11 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams and 30 Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) teams were assisting the administration in rescue and relief operations, he said.

Authorities were anticipating flooding of several coastal districts after 50 gates of the Hirakud dam on the Mahanadi river in Sambalpur district were opened Wednesday evening following heavy rain in the upper catchment area. The released dam water passed the delta head Mundali in Cuttack Wednesday night and it was well within the safe limit.

“Therefore, the possibility of high flood in the downstream area is ruled out,” the official said.

Devastating floods in Jammu and Kashmir have caused an immediate loss of Rs. 5,400-5,700 crore to the state’s economy, with heavy damages to trade, hotels, restaurants, horticulture and handicraft, according to initial estimates of industry body Assocham.

Jammu & Kashmir has been hit by the worst floods in over a century, throwing basic infrastructure like power, railways and communication in the state completely out of gear.

The initial estimated loss to hotels, trade, agriculture — horticulture, roads and bridges in the Jammu and Kashmir regions itself is Rs. 2,630 crore. Besides, high-cost infrastructure like Railways, power and communication in the hilly terrains would have suffered a loss of about Rs. 2,700-3,000 crore, the industry body said.

“These are only initial estimates of the loss. The real loss to the Jammu and Kashmir economy will be much higher since the impact of such calamities is long-drawn and it takes long time before the physical infrastructure is restored. The biggest worry is the shattering of confidence among the tourists and it will take long time and effort to win back the tourists to the state,” said Assocham Secretary General D.S. Rawat.

Mr. Rawat cited the example of Uttarakhand which also witnessed unprecedented floods last year, saying it was yet to recover from the shocks.

“J&K’s economy stood at Rs. 45,399 crore in 2013-14. The sectoral composition of state GDP indicates that agri & allied activities account for 20 per cent in the state GDP, industry and mining contribute to about 23.5 per cent and the services sector made up the remaining 56.5 per cent. Trade, hotels and restaurant services registered a turnover of close to Rs. 3,800 crore during 2013-2014. The tourism industry sources of J&K state roughly distribute the tourists among Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh region in the ratio of 40:40:20,” according to Assocham.

“The September-November season tourist inflow both from India and abroad is severely affected as is being witnessed by large scale cancellations.

At least 24 engineering college students from Hyderabad were feared washed away in river Beas in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh late on Sunday evening.

The students were reportedly washed away by the flash floods that occurred in the river after water was released from the upstream Larji Hydro electric project. The engineering students who had entered the river bank on the Mandi-Manali highway were apparently taking photographs at Thalot.

The sudden surge of water swept away at least 18 boys and 6 girls of VNR Institute of Engineering and Technology catching them completely unaware. The college is located in Bachupally on the outskirts of Hyderabad.

There were 61 tourists, including 48 students of the engineering college, who were travelling to the hill station of Manali. Out of 24 missing students, 6 were girls, police said.

The local administration said the gates at Pandoh dam in Mandi, about 15 kms downstream, have been shut to fish out the bodies. The vehicular traffic on the busy Mandi-Manali highway has also been closed to conduct the rescue operations.

The students were on an industrial tour and left Hyderabad on June 3. One of the students, Pratyusha who saved herself said that they were on their way to Kullu from Shimla and they were taking pictures on the river bed. Some students went a bit deep into the waters and they couldn’t rush back as the gushing waters swept them away.

“The project officials had sounded an alert but we did not hear it,” she said sobbing uncontrollably seeking the help of the media to bring them back. “There has been no assistance so far from the HP authorities except for the police grilling us about the number of students,” she lamented.

Andhra Pradesh Resident Commissioner Shashank Goel said that information given by the Mandi Deputy Commissioner Dwesh Kumar said: “The Deputy Commissioner has not confirmed any casualties.”

Himachal Pradesh officials said that the students who were feared washed away could surface in Pandoh dam, which is 15 kms downstream of the site of the tragedy. “Himachal Pradesh officials have requisitioned the services of divers and rafts to take up relief and rescue operations,” Mr. Goel said adding that a two-member team of AP Bhavan – P.Ravin Shankar (Assistant Commissioner) and M. V. S. Rama Rao (Protocol Officer) are leaving by the first flight to Kullu, which has an airport.

If roads across the city are giving public a harrowing time, Elcot Avenue road on Shollinganallur is blatantly harassing its inhabitants. Most of whom are IT employees, have not been able to leave their homes and are working from indoors for the last three days.This is because the Metro Water decided to dig up a perfectly laid concrete road right at the centre to lay a sewer line just last week before monsoon lashed the city. The locality of more than 2000 families is now miserably grid locked. It is a similar situation in adjoining Model School Road and Kumarasamy Main Road where a corporation garbage truck has been stuck in the middle of all the debris, trench and water for three days now.A crane that came to remove it just got stuck along with it. ""I have to spend ten thousand rupees to get the truck out now,"" the conservancy inspector said. The dug up concrete has left over bulky rocks have been mounted all along the centre of the road.A concrete road is three times more expensive to lay than a tar road.

In this locality, that does not hold good.""Metrowater sought permission in May to cut the road but they had problems digging it so they have just started work,"" a corporation official said.

Since the water receded on Tuesday, residents moved some of the debris in an attempt to make it less dangerous for road users. ""A pizza delivery boy fell into one of the trenches and was injured,"" he said.Before the road was dug up, residents protested and a 200m gap was left to get out of their houses.

The tamarind tree here that offered sanctuary and saved more than 150 lives during the Musi floods of 1908, would be protected and the past glory of its immediate environs at Afzal Park would be revived, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) Commissioner Somesh Kumar said here on Sunday.

At a meeting organised under the same saviour tree by Centre for Deccan Studies (CDS) and Forum For Better Hyderabad (FBH) to pay homage to the 1908 Musi flood victims, Mr. Somesh Kumar said experts would be roped to restore and maintain the historic tree. The availability of money was not an issue for the civic body, he said.

Responding to pleas to save the Musi, Mr. Somesh Kumar said the task involved departments such as revenue, water board, irrigation and also active involvement on part of the local populace.

“Transforming Musi into a live river and restoring its old glory is a herculean task. However, it can be done and I am hopeful we will do it,” he said.

Towards protecting the city’s heritage, the GHMC has been actively pursuing various works, including the Charminar Pedestrianisation Project and restoration works at the Quli Qutub Shahi Tombs, he said, adding that incentives for protection of heritage structures were also under consideration and orders could be expected soon.

“At least five to six monuments of Hyderabad should be on the UNESCO list but there are none. We need commitment to preserve heritage and maintain them,” the GHMC Commissioner added.

CDS secretary Sajjad Shahid recounted the accounts of havoc caused by the 1908 floods and said the ravaging Musi swept through colonies, destroyed properties and affected thousands of people.

“Hyderabad showed remarkable resilience and rebuilt,” he said, adding that more than 100 years later, the city was still facing similar problems. Mr. Shahid said the tamarind tree needed to be recognised, protected and respected.

FBH president M. Vedakumar called for steps to address issues related to dumping of pollutants and garbage and encroachments to save the Musi.

I have returned from the hell that Srinagar and much of the Kashmir Valley is today. I have returned with my parents only because of the Indian Army and the kindness of strangers. Everything else has collapsed in most of Srinagar.

I went to Srinagar on Saturday alarmed by reports of floods in the Kashmir Valley to reassure my parents who lived there, but not very concerned about their safety. Four generations of Mattoos had lived in our family home, in one of the most pleasant neighbourhoods of Srinagar: Gogji Bagh. My grandfather liked to tell his grandchildren that they should ensure that their spine was as strong as the foundations of our house! It had survived every vicissitude in the ups and downs of the Mattoo family and Kashmir: earthquakes, militancy (a bullet in my great grandfather’s portrait is a reminder of the violent 1990s), deaths and personal grief.

On Saturday evening, there was the first ominous sign: there was a power outage. We slept, however, comforted by the prediction of the local meteorology chief, Sonam Lotus, who has become a popular icon for the accuracy of his forecasts, that Sunday would be sunny. And indeed I woke to a radiant blue sky with not a cloud in sight. But the power outage had continued through the night, and I got a frightened phone call from a neighbour at about 9.30 a.m. that the bund on the bank of the Jhelum (near Lal Ded hospital, about a kilometre from our house) had been breached!

Within minutes the water was streaming ferociously into our garden. I calculated we had about an hour before our ground floor was submerged; actually we had just about 30 minutes.

In that frenzy, we could only really clear the kitchen: food and water to feed a staff of 12 — and moved to the upper storeys. The water had risen one- and-a-half storeys by the afternoon and we stayed up that night maintaining a vigil, not entirely sure what we would do if the water rose to the upper floors: we had no power, no phones (mobile or landline), no contact with anyone, and just a couple of messages that we were not sure had been delivered. The night echoed with cries of ‘bachao bachao’ from the nearby Gujjar and Bakerwal hostel in Amar Singh college and other places!

On Monday morning, we were finally rescued by the brave jawans of the Indian Army in a paddle boat and taken to a safer point at the bund – with just one small bag each.

There was no sign of relief or help.

The only option was to rush to the airport. We did so with the kindness of good Samaritans, and after walking kilometres in waist-deep water. Many who helped had never met us, some were friends from Facebook, including Ashraf Bhat – a distinguished lawyer, who walked with us and dropped us near the airport, young Suhail who helped us find a short cut and helped my parents traverse the wall that led us to a dryer route. And Dr. Khan and Sherwani Sahib for finally dropping us to the airport!

We are back in Delhi’s safety, but deeply concerned about those in the valley who are still marooned. Today, Prime Minister, rescue Kashmir, and Kashmiris will respect you forever!

Malti and Bhagwati Devi are just two of the thousands of people who have had to abandon their homes to take shelter on an embankment in flood-affected Bihar’s Supaul district. Their main worry, however, is not hunger but the difficulties they face in going through their ablutions unlike men. “Poor women like us face more problems to relieve ourselves when floods force us to flee our villages. It is our fate. No one can imagine this except those like us,” said Bhagwati, in her late 30s, who along with her family have taken shelter on the eastern Kosi embankment.

Malti, in her early 50s and the mother of three young daughters, spoke of her ignominy. “We have no option but to relieve ourselves in the open by closing our eyes and minds to the hell-like situation,” she said.

With major rivers including the Kosi, Gandak, Bagmati and Ganga rising and posing a serious threat, Malti and Bhagwati are two of thousands of women in flood—affected districts in the state living with shame and fighting to relieve themselves. “Flood-hit poor women face more problems than men as more than for food, they have to fight shame and shock to relieve themselves either on the crowded embankment or nearby. There is no other place as there is life—threatening water all around,” said Ranjeev, a flood expert who works in the Kosi region.

Mahender Yadav, an activist working in the same regiion, told IANS: “It is beyond imagination how women trapped by the rising rivers go through their ablutions.”

A much sought—after item by these women is polythene sheets or bags with which they can wrap around themselves and stand in the water to relieve themselves. “Even polythene sheets are in short supply as the authorities have failed to provide them,” Mr. Yadav said.

Ranjeev said neither the men of their families nor the government pay proper attention to this big problem of women in the flood—hit district.

He said that there is no plan to erect makeshift toilets on the embankments for women. “A few years ago, a British woman researcher was with me on a visit to an embankment during floods. She was stunned to know that women have been forced to relieve themselves in the open as there was no arrangement made for them,” Ranjeev recalled.

It is over 10 days that rivers continued to flow above the danger mark in Saharsa, Supaul, Madhepura, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Khagaria, Sitamarhi, Nalanda and other districts, affecting 1.6 million people in more than 850 villages.

Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, after an aerial survey of the flood—affected 15 districts last week said the situation is grim but under control. He ordered the district officials to provide relief and rescue on a priority basis to people living in inundated areas.

The floods have so far claimed 17 lives in the state.

The state government has evacuated 116,000 people till date from flooded areas and around 50,000 people have taken shelter in 133 relief camps set up by the government at different places. The government had earlier sounded a high alert as the water level of major rivers in north Bihar rose following heavy rain in their catchment areas in Nepal.

Soon, MRTS commuters will have a view of a cleaner Central Buckingham Canal.

After a decade, the stretch of the canal running along the MRTS line is witnessing a major desilting exercise. Earlier this week, the Water Resources Department (WRD) of the PWD began desilting a few portions of the 7.1-km-long stretch at a cost of Rs. 20 crore.

The waterway between Chepauk and Greenways Road railway stations has remained a difficult portion to improve due to encroachments. Once in a year, the WRD removes floating garbage from the canal to ensure free flow before the onset of the northeast monsoon. With many of the city’s major waterways getting a facelift, the WRD has initiated the work in portions of the canal that do not suffer from encroachments.

“A biometric survey of the 5,100 families living along the canal is in progress before relocation can be taken up. Only 1,000 families have been covered so far,” a WRD official said.

Instead of waiting till the encroachments are removed, the WRD has now decided to desilt the canal and also construct a flood protection wall for a distance of 1.1 km near Swami Sivananda Salai, Wallajah Road and Greenways Road.

The Rs. 20.47-crore project will be taken up under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.

At present, the canal has shrunk in some portions. “We want to widen the canal by a minimum of 15 metres. Some of the stretches identified are near Greenways Road railway station and near Dr. Radhakrishnan Salai,” said the official.

Originally, the canal had a capacity to carry up to 5,600 cubic feet per second (cusecs). “Now, it can carry only 600 cusecs during rains. We want to improve the capacity to at least 1,000 cusecs,” the official added.

Two bridges on Kutchery Road and near Ice House will also be widened as part of the work. Constructing a flood protection wall would be a challenge as a pile foundation would have to be laid two metres below the canal bed, an official said. However, the department is planning to complete the work by October.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

As a fortunate survivor of one of India’s deadliest railway disasters, the Ariyalur train accident, it is time to lay my story and the nightmarish ghosts to rest, by putting my experiences down in writing.

It occurred on November 23, 1956, leaving 142 passengers dead and 110 injured. An estimated 200 people were buried in the debris. Many were missing, their bodies never to be recovered.

Torrential rains had swollen the river Maruthaiyar to a level where the waters almost touched the rails on a bridge between the Ariyalur and Kallagam stations, breaking the embankment to a length of nearly 20 feet, causing flash floods.

Off the rails About 2 miles after leaving Ariyalur station and 20 miles away from Trichinopoly (Tiruchirapalli), the train slipped off the rails. Its steam engine and seven timber-built carriages including the parcel van telescoped and fell into the river. The eighth coach derailed and four carriages in the rear remained intact.

Then aged 21, I had boarded the Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) Express at Madras (Chennai) at 9.50 the night before, with my aunt. Like Santa in his gift-filled sleigh, we were laden with our Christmas shopping from Moore Market, an old-fashioned steam engine deputising for the reindeer for our journey to Trichinopoly. We were the only occupants of a bay of the eighth compartment of the 13-coach train, one having been detached at Virudhachalam to go on to Salem separately. After a light meal, we settled down for the night and soon fell into deep sleep.

Our terrifying ordeal began with a tremendous jolt and bang. There was a sizzling hiss of steam and, then, ear-piercing screams. After being left sprawling across the floor of the compartment, my first urge after regaining my composure was to jump out of the train. My aunt grabbed me on time: “Don’t jump! We are on a river,” she screamed. She saved me from a watery grave.

Like a puppet on a string, I ran around the compartment in circles. My watch showed it was 5.30 a.m. Peering out of the window, the first crack of daylight revealed a mighty river that roared eerily as it frothed and rushed furiously, taking everything in its path — trees, train wreckage and bodies of men, women and infants. Perched on a platform on the bridge, the guard yelled, “Get out, your compartment has derailed.” In response, my aunt, in her overpowering voice, shouted: “follow me.” “I can’t,” I cried, clinging to her. Wrenching herself off, she bravely unlatched the door and lowered herself to the step of the compartment precariously. She then clambered along, holding on window to window and heading towards the rear of the train.

In an incredible act of heroism, we were walking back to Ariyalur station to seek help.

Prayer for deliverance Turning my eye heavenward, I prayed for deliverance. Mustering my courage and leaving the precious parcels behind, I followed my aunt in utter terror along with other passengers who had vacated the eighth coach. I remembered the lines from Tennyson’s ‘The Charge of the Light Brigade’: “...into the valley of death rode...”

My heart pounded, my teeth chattered and I trembled with fear and cold as I gripped the window bars of the compartments. Loosening my grip would mean certain death. Using every ounce of my strength and with unswerving determination I struggled to save my life. With bruised palms I swayed across four compartments and eventually reached the last compartment in the reassuring presence of my aunt. She was a heroine.

Frightening hours Being stranded there, waiting to be rescued with floodwaters on either side of the track, were the most frightening hours of my life, observing a scene a human eye could never have seen. It has haunted me all my life. The river bank was bathed in blood with human pulp, headless corpses, severed limbs, torsos and heaps of bodies wrecked of life’s esteem.

After an anxious wait of about four hours, the floodwaters gradually abated. Finally, as the river meekly meandered in its course and corpses bobbed in and out of water, we were rescued. A locomotive arrived to tow us safely back to the Ariyalur station.

There were triumphant screams mingled with sadness for those lost in one of the worst disasters that gripped a nation.

( At the time of the accident, young Joyce Philomena was a clerk at the Golden Rock Railway School in Tiruchi, newly recruited by Southern Railway. Two years later, she was tranferred to the Divisional Railway Superintendent's office in Tiruchi. She married Clarence Vernem, a Guard with Southern Railway, and moved to Madurai where she continued to work for the Railways until opting for voluntary retirement from service in 1982.

The following year, Mr. Vernem passed away. She migrated to Australia in 1996 to join her two children and their families. She now lives in Melbourne (right). Upon being contacted by The Hindu on the phone on March 1 after she sent in her account to Open Page, Ms. Vernem (who provided the details given here of herself) said she remained terrified of trains for years. She later mustered the courage if only to watch passing trains, and would marvel at “how brave the passengers were” !

After suffering nightmares and sleep-walking disorders, she eventually overcame her dread, and often passed Ariyalur by train. A year shy of 80, she still occasionally takes the train in Australia, and lives a “very active life.”

No review of Aindhaam Thalaimurai Sidha Vaidhiya Sigamani can begin without acknowledging that title, which seems to have been devised solely as a means to rag students from Mumbai and Delhi who’ve just stepped into a Chennai college. “Pronounce this without pausing.” They’re done for.

The film, on the other hand, seems to have been devised as a hazing session for the audience. “Try sitting through this without looking at your watch every five minutes.”

The story is something that appears to have been scraped up from the reject pile of K. Bhagyaraj’s scripts, circa the 1980s. An unschooled youth (Sigamani, played by Bharath) dreams of marrying an educated woman (Nandita) and pretends to be an MBBS-wielding doctor — although he is really a naturopath, which, in director L.G. Ravichandhran’s eyes, is a lesser accomplishment.

Genre: Comedy Director: LG Ravichandhran Cast: Bharath, Nandita, Karunakaran Storyline: An unschooled man pretends to be a doctor to woo an educated girl Bottomline: A drag with some scattered laughs

The sticky situations Sigamani finds himself in should have been a riot, but the laughs are few — a joke about a half-boiled egg and an omelette tickled my inner six-year-old — and we are thrown at the mercy of melodramatic plot elements (villains, infidelity) that quickly become a drag.

Vellala Street off Purasawalkam High Road mirrors the metamorphosis that the once quaint neighbourhood has undergone over the past three decades.

Remnants of old houses on the street tell tales of the town that existed before Purasawalkam turned into Chennai’s commercial hub.

Eminent author R.K. Narayan was born here, and veteran politician K. Anbazhagan lived here.

Dates in History DID YOU KNOW! The Perumalpet 24-hour hospital run by the Chennai Corporation on Kariappa Street was built in the early 1900s. A single-storeyed residential building was converted into the hospital

“There were only a handful of textile shops earlier. Over time, several old cinema theatres like Roxy, Mekala and Uma have given way to textile showrooms and shopping complexes,” he says.

With an amalgamation of politicians, musicians, potters and the Anglo-Indian community living there, Purasawalkam housed centuries-old temples like Gangadeeswarar temple and schools like E.L.M. Fabricius Higher Secondary School.

Seventy-five-year-old N. Paramasivam says, Tana Street, now a hub of jewellery business, was a desolate stretch with dense tree cover in the 60s.

“I would walk home alone, watching out for drunkards on the pitch-dark stretch. During floods in 1971, there was waist-deep water in the bylanes of Tana Street,” he says.

Apartment complexes have slowly replaced independent bungalows and tile-roof houses in the area. P. Satyanarayanan, resident of New Manickam Street, says: “I used to play on Tana Street with my Anglo-Indian friends in the 70s. A small ‘dhobi khana’ near Kosapet serves as a reminder of a waterbody in Purasawalkam.”

The locality, once thickly-populated with Anglo-Indians who worked in government offices, has only around 200 families now.

Kenneth Reinhardt of Letangs Road, says: “Our community lived near the churches and schools of Doveton. Many bakeries I used to frequent for baking of Christmas cakes have closed down now. This place was also home to hockey stalwarts like Jimmy Carr.”",discussion,Chennai Floods 1971,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",1971,1971,Chennai,1000 mm,100s of crores,100s,"Major disruption to daily life, loss of property and livelihoods",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Leveraging the popularity of cinema stars in Tamil Nadu looks to be a priority for BJP’s Prime Ministerial candidate, Narendra Modi, going by his recent bonhomie with celebrities from the tinsel world.

While on Sunday, Mr. Modi hit the headlines following his tete-a-tete with ‘Superstar’ Rajinikanth, on Wednesday, actor Vijay called on the Gujarat Chief Minister in Coimbatore.

BJP sources said, at the meeting, which the Twitter account of Mr. Vijay described as ‘non-political’, Mr. Modi enquired after the actor’s recent and upcoming film projects.

Mr. Vijay expressed his appreciation for the work Mr. Modi had done in Gujarat and wished him luck in the upcoming elections, said sources.

Like his meeting with Mr. Rajinikanth, his interaction on Wednesday too resulted in a tsunami of activity online, with pictures of them together flooding Facebook and Twitter.

In fact, Mr. Modi himself tweeted a picture of them chatting, which was then retweeted by more than 1,100 persons, within an hour.

A BJP leader said, while other parties in Tamil Nadu were using small-time celebrities to campaign for them, Mr. Modi had struck the right chord with people of the State by meeting the ‘stars who matter’.

“Mr. Vijay has a huge following. We are certainly happy about the meeting,” said the senior leader.

In fact, meeting the ‘bigger stars’ has been Mr. Modi’s style. In January, he flew kites with Bollywood superstar Salman Khan.

Mr. Vijay too seems to be inclined to meeting important leaders of political parties. In 2009, Mr. Vijay met Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi, who apparently extended an invitation to the actor to join the party.

The rain brought down the temperature by 14C. The day began bright but saw intermittent showers from evening. The temperature dropped to 27. 4C after reaching a maximum of 38C.Weathermen said these short thunderstorms occur during evening and night, triggered by the heat and sea breeze.“The thunderstorms happened because of a combination of three factors — heat, unstable atmosphere and moisture,” said Met department director S R Ramanan.Nungambakkam recorded 6.7mm of rain while Meenambakkam recorded 26mm. Duty officers at weather observatories said that the northern and southern parts of the city experienced a lot of rain while central Chennai received little. On Saturday too there was a vast difference with Nungambakkam getting 2.4mm and Meenambakkam 61.88mm.“The changes in rainfall are because the winds take the thunderclouds in different directions. So some places get showers while others get only drizzles,” Ramanan said.Heavy spells in short intervals may be good news, but the infrastructure cannot handle the excess water. Most roads, especially in Velachery, Besant Nagar and Santhome, were flooded as storm water drains are unable to carry the excess water.“It was the first time I experienced hail and I collected a bunch of it in my hands,” said S K Manikandan, a commuter near Porur.Rains are expected during the next few days too. “There was a heat wave-like situation in the city in the last ten days that caused concern and it was predicted that there would be a thunderstorm during the weekend,” said R Suresh, director, Airport Meteorological Office.“Night temperatures were 30C while it should have been around 22C.

These original stones will be reused during restoration of the temple complex,” Culture Ministry sources told Deccan Herald.



As of now, the work force has been deployed in removing debris at the site. The temple restoration team, which resumed the work after reopening of the Himalayan shrine in May this year, has so far managed to remove nearly 10,417 cubic feet debris from the western side, despite bad weather.



Removal of debris is on from the northern side and the rear of the temple, sources added. The ASI has also brought 25 stone carvers from Rajasthan for cutting and carving to size locally available gneiss stone, the material used in the construction of the temple.



“Carving and cutting of these locally available stones are a tough task because of its hardness. Sometimes chisels don’t work on them,” sources said. The major works that the ASI has targeted to complete by October 20 this year includes packing of the stones, matching their original profile and design wherever it is missing and furnishing wooden flooring within Mandapa inside the temple.



Cleaning the temple’s interior and exterior, preserving its stone surfaces as well as repairing its steps and stone plinth are other works the ASI would undertake. Once the rain is over, the ASI will start work to stop seepage from the temple walls.



A systematic scanning of roof joints will be conducted to plug all holes and loose joints to ensure that there is no leakage inside the temple.



“The ASI will start sealing of the joints at the temple to stop seepage once the rain is over. We have to complete this task by October 20 as the temple will then be closed,” sources said.



Scientific cleaning of the walls, columns and ceiling inside Garbhagriha of the temple, which is almost complete, has revealed 16 donatory inscriptions on the walls and columns inside the temple.



A team of Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Chennai, is conducting a scientific probe at the Kedarnath temple to assess the impact of the flash floods on the temple’s foundation.



The ASI would begin work on strengthening the foundation based on the team’s observations and recommendations.

465,1004,chennai,2014,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/mar/26/india-brahmaputra-river-floods-land,26 Mar 2014,India's Brahmaputra river: 'The flood waters are eating away at our land',"Man Maya Bhujel stands on the banks of the Brahmaputra river. The small village of Laupani is nearby. In the distance, a pink evening light shines on the snowy ridges of the eastern Himalayas.

""When I came to the village to marry, 42 years ago, it took an hour to walk to the river,"" says Bhujel. ""Now the river's waters are here, eating away at our land, heaping sand on our paddy fields.""

The Brahmaputra is one of the world's mightiest rivers, 10km wide in places. Its waters rise more than 5,000 metres up the Tibetan Plateau and flow for about 3,000km through China, India and Bangladesh before joining the Ganges and emptying into the Bay of Bengal.

The river is a lifeline to millions, delivering vital nutrients to the plains of Assam and other areas, but its fast flowing waters also cause widespread misery. In 2012, more than 1.5 million people in Assam were displaced by floods, with many lives lost and whole villages washed away.

Bhujel is 70. Her calloused hands and lined face are testament to a lifetime of hard work on the land. She is dressed in a widow's white sari: her husband died last year.

""We once had three bighas of land [one bigha is about a third of an acre], but most of it has been eaten away by the river. The last thing my husband did before he died was sell our cattle.""

In part the flooding and land erosion is a natural phenomenon. The Brahmaputra carries a vast volume of water, an amount only exceeded by the Amazon and Congo rivers.

As the Brahmaputra's waters cascade down from the mountains on to the soft alluvial soils of Assam, they eat away at the river's banks and deposit tons of sand on nearby lands, turning once verdant areas into what looks like an enormous beach.

North-eastern India is a highly seismic zone. An earthquake in 1950 was one of the most violent recorded, altering the geology of the entire Brahmaputra river basin and raising the river level by eight to 10 metres in places.

But rampant deforestation, particularly in areas further upstream, is another factor driving land loss.

""Over time different rivers in the Brahmaputra basin have merged, braiding over a very wide area, and thousands of square kilometres of paddy fields have been lost,"" says Professor Jogendra Nath Sarma, a local geologist who has been studying the Brahmaputra for years.

""Population growth and immigration from Bangladesh and other areas has put a big strain on Assam's land resources. In the past people would migrate to higher ground during the monsoon and flooding season, but now there is nowhere for them to go."".

Laupani is almost entirely populated by Nepalis, whose ancestors migrated from their mountain homes to the plains of Assam in search of a better life more than a century ago.

Subhakar Subedi, the village chief, says farmers are experimenting with more flood resistant rice strains. Others are turning what land they have left into small tea gardens or vegetable plots.

There are pools of stagnant water, left behind by last year's floods. They provide ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes; malaria, says Subedi, is on the rise.

The government has erected flood defences in some areas. Aaranyak, a locally based NGO, has joined forces with the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development – the only transboundary organisation looking at development issues across the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region – to install a number of flood early warning devices along the Brahmaputra's banks.

Subedi says the government in New Delhi should be doing more.

""Our ancestors were poor but we are poorer. The politicians come – especially now, at election time – and say they will help us. But little happens – it's all wada, wada [promises, promises].""

India's north-east is a tribal area. With its tea plantations and plentiful natural resources, including oil and coal, it was once one of the country's richest regions. Now it is one of the poorest.

Many people in the area feel cut off from the rest of India and neglected by central government. There have been frequent violent clashes between indigenous groups and central government authorities.

There are few young men in Laupani. With little land left to farm, many have migrated in search of work, mainly to cities such as Chennai and Bangalore in southern India.

People in Laupani and elsewhere along the Brahmaputra face other challenges. Many glaciers in the eastern Himalayas and on the Tibetan Plateau that feed into the Brahmaputra are melting due to higher temperatures.

Accumulations of soot-like black carbon pollutants on the snowy peaks cause more heat to be absorbed, hastening glacial melt. In the short term this could lead to larger and more volatile river water flows.

Both India and China, its northerly neighbour, are involved in a large-scale dam building programme on upstream areas of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries. The consequences for downstream communities are uncertain.

Bhujel is concerned with the day to day. One of her grandsons is using bamboo poles to build a new, temporary dwelling for the extended family.

""With every monsoon season, we fear we will have to move again. The river is always hungry for more land,"" she says.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

CHENNAI: Army chiefs are decorated for the wars they lead, but when Sundarajan Padmanabhan retired he came to be known as the general who got the Army together for a war that was not waged.When his more controversial successors have penned their lives, Padmanabhan, who chose to retire to a quiet colony in Adyar, has chosen to write books on India’s relations with other countries.“A book on what happened when I was chief would be controversial and I’m too old for that now,” said the 74-year-old former General, who is known for mobilizing the Army during Operation Parakram.Operation Parakram involved India’s military standoff with Pakistan in response to the 2001 terror attack on the Parliament. The operation — which involved massive army build-up along the LoC — was however called off, leaving many questions unanswered. “We were well placed. Pakistan had problems on its Baloch front and Afghanistan, and if at that time war had taken place, the outcome would have been decisive,” said Padmnabhan, who earned a reputation as a tough, aggressive commander in Kashmir. He said the Indian government had a lot of inhibitions. “We stayed put for 11 months and eventually withdrew. It’s an old story I may write about some day, but I’m not ready now,” he said.Twelve years later, it isn’t Pakistan that he sees as the biggest foe to India, but China. In his latest venture, ‘China-India War – World’s First Water War – 2029’, he predicts a conflict between the two countries over the Brahmaputra. The seeds for this conflict have already been sown: China recently announced that it has completed a major dam on the Brahmaputra, which it calls Yarlung Zangbo, in Tibet. India has raised concerns that the dam could cause flash floods and landslides downstream.But Padmnabhan’s ‘futuristic fiction’ is based on the friction between the two countries over China diverting the Brahmaputra, which flows south into India and Bangladesh, to north to Northwest China. “We could be in serious trouble if that happens. War should be the last option, and tact the first,” he said, “My book is based on the year 2029, when hopefully India’s growth is far ahead of China. Even if a conflict on these lines turns out to be a reality, what India needs to do now is to garner support from its neighbours like China is doing now with Pakistan, Myanmmar and to some extent Sri Lanka”.Although he has penned two other books on military and diplomacy, it is children’s books that Padmanbhan hopes to write some day. “People are usually surprised when I say I have a penchant for writing children’s books. I think catering for them will be more challenging than anything I’ve taken on,” said the septuagenarian.He may have retired, but Padmanabhan’s link to the Army is still strong. Former Army chiefs still drop into his apartment, where idols of deities share space with vestiges from his days in the Army.An idol of Lord Ganesha sits atop a polished empty shell, a framed picture of a battle scene painted by a colonel shares the same space on the same wall as another deity.Padmanabhan begins his day by reading five newspapers and poring over a crossword puzzle.“People ask me how I have been spending my retired life. They expect me to say I exercise and try to be fit and attend lots of functions. The truth is I don’t do any of that. I prefer sitting with a paper and pencil and writing whatever inspires me,” he said.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The south-west monsoon for the year 2014 officially ended on September 30. Overall the monsoon has been a mixed bag with many areas of India having a deficit but some areas having a surplus. In the city of Bangalore we were confronted with heavy rains in September; on one particular day it rained more than 120 mm in a short span of a few hours, causing flooding. This will be the pattern in cities, floods at certain times and shortage of piped water at the same time.

As cities get paved, creating hard impenetrable surfaces, the ability of rainwater to percolate into the soil and thence to the aquifer reduces to almost zero. Surface run-off increases dramatically and can go up by a factor of 9. The garbage-choked drains have to cope with a high intensity of rainfall and substantially increased run-off, not to mention buildings in valleys and low lying areas, causing urban floods. At the root of this phenomenon is lack of planning, and building in the wrong places. Not respecting drainage lines and flood plains exacerbates the situation. What can be done about it?

One remedy is to design and plan for every urban micro-watershed by reducing run-off and increasing infiltration into the soil and aquifers. A recharge well is a good way of doing this.

What is a recharge well? Usually a precast concrete ring lined structure, typically a metre or 1.5 metres in diameter and going to a depth of 3 to 8 metres, a recharge well takes water run-off from rooftops, paved areas and roads, filters it and sends it underground to increase the water table. Unlike a conventional well which taps into the aquifer, the recharge well sends water into the aquifer. By changing the flow of rainwater into the ground it is possible to mitigate the impact of floods.

A well-designed recharge well, depending on the soil profile of a place, can send a million litres of water annually into the ground. By coordinating a given catchment area, the coefficient of runoff and the infiltration rate at a place, appropriate recharge wells can be made and the numbers required can be arrived at. They can be linked to the stormwater drains present and placed within the drains itself.

Layouts, apartments and institutions have found that they become zero storm-water discharge zones and have had the added benefit of increased water availability in their borewells and open wells.

It is time that we use the recharge well as an important tool in the sustainable management of water in our cities and in preventing or mitigating floods. October is one of the rainiest months in the city of Bangalore and it would be best that October rains are directed into our wells. The time is now.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

By Keith Schneider

Circle of Blue

Ten months after a brutal flood killed thousands of people, leveled riverbank communities, and battered hydroelectric projects across the northern state of Uttarakhand in India’s Himalayan region, a panel of experts has concluded that hydropower development significantly amplified the damage.

The committee found that existing oversight practices do not adequately account for how significantly power dams affect the Himalayan gorges where they are being built, and called on India to overhaul its policies and practices for approving new hydropower projects. The 11-member committee recommended the cancellation of 23 hydroelectric projects proposed in Uttarakhand because of the ecological damage they would cause.

The report, ‘Assessment of Environmental Degradation and Impact of Hydroelectric Projects During the June 2013 Disaster in Uttarakhand’, was submitted to the Ministry of Environment and Forests on April 16, and made public on April 29. The expert panel was appointed in October 2013 at the direction of the Indian Supreme Court to determine whether Uttarakhand’s hydropower projects influenced the causes and consequences of the flooding that occurred on June 16 and June 17, 2013. Last summer, weeks after the flood, the Supreme Court also ordered a stay on construction and other activities to brng new hydropower projects on line in Uttarakhand.

“It is an honest report prepared by expert professionals wherein even the voices of dissent are recorded in a democratic way,” said Dr. Ravi Chopra, director of the People’s Science Institute, a non-profit public interest research organization based in Dehradun, Uttarkhand’s capital, and the committee’s chairman. “We hope that the court will accept the report in its entirety with all its recommendations.”

The committee’s findings this week prompted a flurry of legal and political responses. The Court ordered work to stop on 23 of the 24 hydropower projects identified in Uttarakhand in a study two years ago for the Ministry of Environment and Forests. That study recommended cancelling those projects due to the excessive damage to rivers, fish, and land they would cause.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests, on May 7, asked the Supreme Court to appoint a new study committee on hydropower and the Uttarakhand flood. The Court responded that they needed more information from the Environment Ministry on why such an appointment was necessary.

Government Agencies Oppose Report Findings

The findings of Dr. Chopra’s committee also were condemned by the Central Electric Authority and the Central Water Commission, two influential energy development agencies that have helped lead India’s ambitious program to develop hydropower in Uttarakhand and four other Himalayan states.

The two agencies issued a joint report that criticized the methodology and science of the report and said “hydro projects had no role in the Uttarakhand flash floods.”

The two agencies added that accepting the study commission’s findings would grievously hamper Indian hydropower development. India is counting on hydropower to produce 150,000 megawatts of electrical generating capacity – comparable to 150 big coal-fired power plants. Only 40,000 megawatts of hydropower generating capacity exists in India today.

“Blaming hydro projects for an unprecedented catastrophe and halting construction without any technical or scientific basis will seriously impact energy security,” the agencies said.

Since 2003, when India launched a national program to develop more megawatts of electrical generating capacity from hydropower, Uttarakhand has been the most active Indian state for building big and small hydro projects. Fifteen big hydropower projects have been commissioned in the state, 14 others are under construction. Some 39 projects, big and small, are proposed in just two river basins, the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi, according to the Central Electric Authority.

On June 16 and June 17, 2013, following days of torrential monsoon rains, a torrent of water, mud, and boulders roared down the narrow gorges of both river basins. More than 6,000 people died, according to the Indian government, though unofficial estimates put the death toll much higher. The damage to roads, buildings, water systems and hydroelectric infrastructure was so extensive much of it has still not been adequately repaired. The flood washed away 25 small hydro projects, and seriously damaged 10 big projects in both river basins.

Dams Amplify Damage

The Supreme Court-sanctioned study commission concluded that existing hydropower projects aggravated the damage. The major reasons, said the commission, were the mountains of silt, sand, and boulders that construction crews excavated to make room for at least 30 big and small hydropower projects, and left unmanaged along the riverbanks. The rushing high water scoured the banks, dissolved the mountains of construction spoils, and pushed the mud and boulders downstream, burying low lying communities.

Over the years, community leaders and environmental organizations have worried about the proximity of the spoils piles to Himalayan rivers, warning about the catastrophic consequences of a big flood. This study is the first official Indian government assessment to confirm that spoils piles are hazardous in high water.

“The damage was due to a combination of the quantity of flood water and the sediment loads carried by the rivers,” the report said.

The authors added, “Muck (sediment) management is a crucial issue. Current practices need to be reviewed and technically sound and ecologically sustainable ways of muck management in Uttarakhand have to be proposed to protect the people and the terrain from a June 2013 type of situation.”

The study commission also scrutinized and confirmed other serious risks from Himalayan hydropower construction. Such dams, said the commission, change river flows, damage fisheries, and can ruin riverine ecosystems. The panel also noted, as did a United Nations climate change study seven years ago, that ponds and lakes formed behind big dams are important sources of methane, a climate-changing air pollutant.

New Problems for India’s Energy Development

The committee recommended that India take a much more comprehensive approach to evaluating hydropower projects.

“The cumulative impact of multiple hydroelectric projects along the same river basin and the threat of a cascading chain of catastrophes in the case of structural failure or even from purely natural causes such as the floods of June 2013 suggest that there is an urgent need for a region or entire basin-based strategic environment assessment rather than individual project-oriented environmental impact assessments that neglect the summation effect,” said the report’s authors.

The committee’s report has raised new challenges for India’s hydropower development program, which has slowed dramatically in recent years. Many of the 23 projects that the committee recommended for permanent dismissal have already been awarded permits and developed contracts for construction with the Uttarakhand government. A senior executive at Jindal Power, a private hydro development company, told The Economic Times, an Indian daily newspaper, that the committee’s recommendations would significantly affect many companies, banks and “the nation’s dream of self-sufficiency.”

India’s insurance companies also are responding to the June 2013 flood. Insurers earlier this year raised the premium for hydropower plants across the Himalayas and other regions of the country. Companies like National Insurance Co. Ltd., United India Insurance Co Ltd., and Oriental Insurance Co. raised premium rates two to fourfold for hydroelectric projects after receiving huge damage claims from hydropower companies like NHPC and Jaiprakash Associates, which operate power plants in Uttarakhand that were seriously damaged by the floods.

“Last year’s Uttarakhand tragedy completely changed the risk perception of hydro power plants for insurance companies. In response to tenders of power companies seeking quotation for re-insurance, insurers have asked for double or triple the earlier rates for power projects,” a senior power ministry official told Indian reporters.

Higher Insurance Rates a New Barrier to Hydro Development

An executive with National Insurance Co. said it was forced to hike premium rates because building and operating hydro projects in the Himalayas has become riskier. “The projects get damaged every year during monsoons. But damage claims during last two years have risen sharply. Last year’s Uttarakhand episode has compelled us to change our assessment,” a company executive told reporters.

One of the projects, NHPC’s 280-megawatt Dhualiganga hydro station, suffered $US 50 million in damage when its turbines and other equipment in the project’s powerhouse were submerged by the flood. The company recovered a major chunk of the loss through insurance claims. Other hydropower projects sustained higher levels of damage.

The study commission’s report received generally high marks from the South Asia Network on Dams, River, and People, an Indian environmental organization. “The lessons from Uttarakhand are relevant for all Himalayan states of India from Kashmir to all the North East states,” wrote Himanshu Thakkar, the group’s coordinator, on the SANDRP Web site. “We hope the Supreme Court will ask the follow up committee to ensure that these lessons are taken note of, and necessary steps flowing from there are implemented in these Himalayan states. These will also provide guidance to our Himalayan neighboring countries.”

Now, they face another problem - ramps extending from properties on to roads.While newer complexes are increasingly constructing railings, steps and ramps on footpaths from the entrance to their properties, older buildings, too, are following suit, say corporation officials.""With the concept of 'raising' the levels of buildings catching on, it is not just new buildings that have ramps protruding onto the road,"" said one official. With roads being re-laid, residents are increasingly looking to raise foundation levels of building to avoid flooding during the rains. ""Many a time, it is raised beyond the road level and the ramps extend outside the property by at least a metre.""The encroachments are also throwing a spanner in the corporation's plan to put up pedestrian-friendly footpaths. ""In some places, we found ramps built from footpaths extending to the road. Every time we remove them, property owners kick up a row,"" said a corporation official. While the risks for pedestrians are obvious, the ramps are also shrinking roads, slowing traffic. Corporation officials say residents rarely mention levels at which houses will be built before getting building designs approved.A visit by TOI to T Nagar, Kodambakkam, Royapettah and Anna Nagar found many such private properties across the footpaths. According to rules, no structure should be built on footpaths or roads.Residents say the road level is higher that the house after it is re-laid and so they raise the level of the house and then build ramps. While corporation officials suggest putting up temporary structures that can be moved, residents say it is too cumbersome.Unlike other encroachments on footpaths, experts say, it is hard to crack down on these ramps. ""It is too rampant and the corporation does not have the machinery or the manpower,"" said road expert Roshan Toshniwal.Corporation officials are gearing to remove ramps extending from properties in some Nungambakkam pockets - which have a number of such structures - using earthmovers. ""They are built on public property and that is clearly a violation. If they want to build ramps they should do it within their property,"" said an official.Pedestrians say some ramps are steep, long and slippery, forcing them on to the road. ""It gets even more difficult during the rain. We have to wade through the water, while at the same time avoid traffic,"" said S Dhivya, a polio-affected student.Experts say ""depressing"" footpaths in front of properties can help.

S. Balasubramanian, the chairman of the Vikatan group of publications, died here on Friday night.

He was 78 and is survived by his wife, a son and six daughters.

Son of film producer and owner of Gemini Studios S.S. Vasan, who founded the magazine, Mr. Balasubramanian made many revolutionary changes in the content of Ananda Vikatan and persuaded Tamil writer Jayakanthan, who had been writing till then only in smaller magazines, to contribute to Vikatan .

Junior Vikatan , a pioneer in the field of investigative journalism, is his brainchild. He also introduced a scheme to identify talent among college students in Tamil Nadu and many journalists now dominating the field are actually the products of the ‘student journalists scheme.’

Mr. Balasubramanian was arrested and lodged in jail for three days for a privilege issue in the Tamil Nadu Assembly in 1987 after he refused to apologise for a cartoon on legislators published on the cover of the magazine. “He was not averse to the idea of apologising. But wondered why he should do it after the Privileges Committee decided everything without giving adequate opportunity to explain his position,” said S. Ashokan, Editor, The Hindu in Tamil and a former editor and publisher of Ananda Vikatan .

He was released after protests across the country. He later filed a suit in the court against his wrongful arrest.

The Madras High Court decided in favour of Mr. Balasubramanian and even awarded compensation. “After encashing the cheque, he framed it and kept it as a memento along with the cartoon drawn by R.K. Laxman, in support of the Vikatan cartoon,” said Mr. Ashokan.

According to his son B. Srinivasan, his body will be donated to the Sri Ramachandra Medical College as per his father’s wishes.

Mr. Balasubramanian was also known for his serious hobbies. He was an expert farmer with a special interest in the cultivation of high-yielding winter vegetable crops. He also had notable success in the breeding of high-quality German Shepherd dogs. But the hobby that made him the leading Indian name was the breeding of rare and new varieties of parrots.

It is unbelievable that the clean-up of the pesticides factory and its surroundings was not done in all these years. I don’t think there can be any country so callous and lethargic as to not clean up such poisonous wastes that continue to be the source of suffering and deaths.

It’s not easy to tell exactly how old he is, because he still bustles about like he’s in his 20s, lifting piano stools, attempting to move grand pianos by himself and juggling back-to-back piano tuning appointments every day. He’s not sure how old he is either, owing to a flood that washed his birth certificate away.

S. Venkateswara Rao, a piano tuner for over 50 years, says, “I don’t celebrate my birthday, I only celebrate music.” Active and agile, he is keen to talk about himself and the glamorous cine world that surrounds him. He states dates and incidents with accuracy and yet, struggles to remember the name of people who walk up to greet him. “I’m surprised at how much trouble comes at this age,” he says, laughing.

He was born in Rajamundhry. His father died when he was five and his mother fell prey to tuberculosis by the time he turned 12. His uncle, who brought him up, was a harmonist for street theatre, which kept him in the art circle during his childhood. At 14, he was taken in by Ratna Varma in Machilipatnam, whose shop he worked and often slept in, learning to tune and make instruments. In two years, he’d mastered the art of making and repairing many string instruments like veenas, violins and harmoniums.

He moved to Madras when we was 16, at a time when trams still traversed the streets. He worked in many musical shops in the city, where he learned the technical aspects of making and tuning bigger, professional instruments.

Four years on, he got the opportunity to be a piano repairing technical assistant at Musee Musical, for a monthly salary of Rs. 60. He still works there today, as a freelance tuner, making about Rs. 1,000 for two hours of work.

To learn international tuning, he started training under Master Dhanraj, even before Ilaiyaraaja could learn from the famous music teacher. “I’m Ilaiyaraaja’s senior,” he says, smiling proudly.

Rao says there are about 3-4 other tuners in the city who he has heard about, but never met, making him quite a rarity. “You know the pianos Rajnikanth and Sri Devi play on screen? I’ve tuned those,” he says proudly, yet matter-of-factly. He emphasises that he hasn’t missed a single Ilaiyaraaja composition; he’s always the piano tuner on the job.

In 1967, Rao joined Max Mueller Bhavan and the first ever piano he tuned, was for the legendary Handel Manuel.

He has tuned for the programmes of many big names since then, including musicians Roman Rudnytsky, Billy Taylor and Chico Freeman; music directors A.R. Rahman, Yuvan Shankar Raja, and Harris Jeyaraj; and singers Unni Krishnan, Srinivas and Karthik.

He continues to tune pianos for many in the city, even as he divides his time between tuning appointments for The Music Academy, Taj hotels, The Leela Palace, Chennai, the programme Vijay Super Singers , weddings, receptions and just about any stage with a piano that requires his attention. Typically, he tunes around 15-20 pianos a month.

For the hour-and-a-half he takes to tune a piano, everything is in his control. He tunes in accordance with Bach’s technique and that has been a constant since the day he started. “Till the world ends, the technique will be the same,” he states. Everything else, however, changes.

When his wife of 50 years fell ill, it was a struggle for him and his family of five children. She suffered from diabetes for years and he spent lakhs for the treatment. And then, she died suddenly of a heart attack. “I’m alright,” he says when asked how he came to terms with her death. “Life is as it is. I give full attention only to music; nothing else matters.”

His love for music and his work takes up every inch of his life, including the time he could spend with his seven-year-old grandson. “Fine tuning isn’t possible if you have avocations,” he states plainly.

Rao does not pause to rest because the happiness he derives from work, he gets from nothing else. Yet, his work is done well before the curtain goes up.

While a guitarist plays with six strings on stage, he works with the 220 strings of a piano backstage, knowing them like the back of his hand. “This is a special technique. One town has one man,” says Rao, who for the longest time, has been tuning for this city.",others,Chennai Floods 2015,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city and suburbs,"1,000 mm (39 in)","Rs. 10,000 crore (US$1.4 billion)",464,10 million people displaced,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage, and inadequate flood control measures.

The rivers Manimala, Pampa and Achenkovil continued to be in spate with no respite in the spell of rain on Sunday.

Flood situation in the Upper Kuttanad region of Thiruvalla taluk is getting grim with the flood waters inundating the paddy fields, rural roads and many settlement colonies in this low-lying part of Pathanamthitta district on Sunday.

Vehicular traffic on many rural roads in the Upper Kuttanad villages of Peringara, Niranom, Kadapra, and Nedumpram has been disrupted owing to flooding. The Mepral-Kidangara Road, Alamthuruthy-Vengal Road, Kombankeri Road, Mepral-Kidangara Road, Peringara-Karackal Road, Azhiyidathuchira-Mepral Road, and Kavumbhagom-Mepral Road had been flooded by Sunday afternoon.

Local people taking their children and other family members in small country boats along the flooded rural roads and across the inundated paddy fields, braving the rains, were common scenes in Upper Kuttanad on Sunday.

The flood waters breached protection walls (bunds) of many paddy fields in the Peringara village.

People did not go out of their houses as flood threat loomed large over the low-lying Upper Kuttanad on Sunday.

Many colonies, that include the Ambedkar colony in Niranom, Kazhuppil colony, Mundappally colony and Alamthuruthy colony in Peringara, have been isolated with the flood waters surrounding these settlements.

District Collector, S.Harikishore, has declared Monday a holiday for all educational institutions, except professional colleges, in Thiruvalla taluk in view of the growing flood threat.

Scarcity of potable water is a major problem facing the flood-hit areas. A good number of wells in Upper Kuttanad have been reportedly inundated contaminating the well water.

The people of Upper Kuttanad have to depend solely on the water supplied by the Kerala Water Authority for their domestic chores.

Ironically, the waterlines of KWA have been remaining dry in many parts of the affected area, leaving the hapless people in distress.

As many as 110 people have been shifted to three flood relief camps opened in Thiruvalla taluk on Sunday. According to official sources, 28 families have been shifted to the relief camp opened at the Community Centre at Thirumoolapuram.

The administration has shifted 20 families to the relief camp opened at KV Upper Primary School at Pulikeezhu and five families to the St. Behenan’s School at Puramattom.",flood,2014 Kerala floods,"Pathanamthitta district, Kerala, India","August 4, 2014","August 5, 2014",Upper Kuttanad region of Thiruvalla taluk,Heavy,"Inundation of paddy fields, rural roads and many settlement colonies",0,"Scarcity of potable water, disruption of vehicular traffic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Its municipal corporation, the oldest in India, is creating a network of footpaths, cycle tracks and greenways to encourage residents to walk or cycle and to ease the passage of human-powered transport like cycle rickshaws and pushcarts.The civic body’s new non-motorised transport policy introduced at the end of September recognises that Chennai has enough paved space for public transport and private vehicles. So, by 2018, it wants to increase the transport mode share of pedestrians and cyclists by 40%, reduce pedestrian and cyclist fatality to zero, create footpaths along 80% of streets, and make sure that most streets with a right-of-way of more than 30 metres have an unobstructed cycle track. In addition to this, it wants to raise the share of public transport in kilometres travelled by 60%.Critically, the new policy promises not to construct flyovers that could prevent parallel pedestrian infrastructure from meeting the right standards.Backing up this wish list with resources, the city is willing to spend 60% of its transport budget on non-motorised transport. Each year, the new policy is estimated to cost about Rs 400 crore.This allocation shows the administration is taking the shift seriously, said Shreya Gadepalli, India director of the Institute of Transportation and Development Policy, which helped the Corporation of Chennai design the policy. “This is a quantum leap,” Gadepalli said. “A civic body is adopting a plan that says walking and cycling are our priorities because they are important for quality of life, transportation and equity.”Sameera Kumar agreed. A transport researcher with Clean Air Asia, Kumar pointed out that big Indian cities typically allocate about 2% of their budget to non-motorised transport.To improve access to public transport, the municipal body’s footpath plan will focus on 471 major bus routes. The pavements will include space for shop frontages, a two-metre pedestrian zone, and space for landscaping and street furniture. The municipality has already spent about Rs 30 crore to widen footpaths on 26 roads and shift obstructing electrical and telephone junction boxes.Though perhaps the first effort in India to find concerted official support, Chennai’s new policy is not the first to recognise the need for pedestrian-friendly roads in cities.In 2010, the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning & Engineering) Centre of the Delhi government had drawn up comprehensive guidelines for pedestrian-friendly road design. In that year, nearly all the road space in the capital was occupied by the 14% of Delhi that drove. Cars, motorcycles and auto rickshaws made up 23% of all trips, while 44% of the trips were by foot. Yet, 40% of Delhi’s road length had no footpaths.In its guidelines, the Delhi centre laid out the minutest details, including the ideal width to be left in front of stores so that people slowing down to window-shop do not obstruct other pedestrians.Still, little attention was paid to its sound advice. “The guidelines for Delhi are excellent, world-class and highly implementable,” said Kanthimatti Kannan, founder of the Right2Walk campaign in Hyderabad. “But because they are guidelines and not mandatory, they do not work. Policies need teeth. Nothing will happen unless it is made into a law.”The main hurdle in implementing a change in road use policy is people’s mind-set, said Kumar. “By prioritising motorists over everyone else, we move vehicles, not people,” he said.This mind-set is on display in Bangalore, where the government is focusing on signal-free road corridors. “The corridors are anti-people because they cut people off on both sides of the road,” Kumar said. Though it does not have a serious non-motorised transport policy, Bangalore does have Tender SURE (Specifications for Urban Road Execution), a move towards widening footpaths and creating proper parking zones at 12 important connecting roads.In Hyderabad, many new and widened footpaths fell into disrepair from lack of maintenance, Kannan said. At other places in the city, they were usurped for parking vehicles. In Mumbai, over 50 million walking trips are made every day. Yet, pedestrians do not get commensurate infrastructure – whether junctions to cross roads, footpaths or road markings, noted Rishi Agarwal of The Walking Project in Mumbai.Chennai aims to deal with the problem of footpath parking by including design elements like knee-high bollards on the edge of pavements. It simultaneously wants to introduce a new IT-based parking management system for private vehicles, whereby parking slots could be rented for a fee. This, it expects, will free up the 40%-50% of footpaths currently occupied by parked vehicles.Agarwal hoped that the Chennai policy will set a precedent, helping residents of other cities pressure their representatives to draft and implement similar schemes.",solution,Chennai floods,"Chennai, India",December 2015,January 2016,Chennai city and suburbs,"1,000 mm","Rs 10,000 crore",400,10 million people displaced,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage, and encroachment of water bodies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Currently GM only exports auto components and Tavera MPVs to neighbouring markets like Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. It has now been revealed that the American manufacturer is chalking up plans to commence exports to the markets in Latin America, starting with the Beat hatchback.

The exports are expected to start from the second half of this year, with the volumes expected to be around 18 to 20 per cent of the total capacity of the Talegaon facility. GM will start by exporting around 2,000 units of the Chevrolet Beat to Chile and will add Mexico, Peru and Central American and Caribbean countries by 2015.

GM has been restructuring its operations around the world, which included separating China from its Consolidated International Operations. In this restructuring, the company’s Indian subsidiary is being given a key role for sourcing the company’s small cars for its global markets.

Speaking to ET, an anonymous source said, ""For the first year, the exports volumes will be small at about 2,000, and then the company intends to export almost 30,000 to 33,000 units of Beat per annum to Latin America in the next two to three years. Mexico will be its largest contributor at around 12,000 to 24,000 units going ahead.""

General Motors currently has manufacturing facilities at Talegaon, Maharashtra and Halol, Gujarat, which have a combined capacity of 2.82 lakh units per annum. The Indian auto industry has been facing a negative growth for some time now and Chevrolet is one of the hardest hit companies. Hence despite the high capacity, the plants are churning out less than 40 per cent of the total volume. In such a condition, it only seems logical that the company puts the idle or surplus capacity to some use.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

The first ever action thriller launched by Yash Raj Films, back in 2004, Dhoom is one of the most promisingly entertaining film franchise in Bollywood. Till date three instalments of the movie have been released , the latest being Dhoom 3, starring megastar Aamir Khan.

All three Dhoom movies featured stories that mainly revolve around an Assistant Commissioner of Police Jai Dixit (played by Abhishek Bachchan), and his associate Ali Akbar (played by Uday Chopra) attempting to capture professional thieves, who are on the lose with their innovative strategies to pull off heists.

John Abraham played the role of a professional thief, expert at his job, in the first instalment. The adrenaline pumping venture grossed almost 290 million at the box office with unbelievable bike stunts and robbery attempts.

Next up was Dhoom 2 that hit the big screens in 2006 with Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai replacing John Abraham and Esha Deol as the antagonists. Hrithik- the unquestionable Greek God of B-town- impressed his legions of fans with his effortless dance moves and incredible action sequences. Hrithik-Aishwarya’s was lava-hot, and the duo’s lip-lock grabbed headlines in a jiffy. No wonder, the movie grossed whopping amount of Rs. 803 million.

The latest offering Dhoom 3 was much in the news before its launch. Since it was an Aamir Khan starrer, the expectations from the movie were much higher as compared to the news made by its prequels. Aamir and Katrina sizzled the silver-screen with their explosive chemistry. Unfortunately, the movie did not quite live up to the hype. No doubt the 2013 movie earned 2.61 billion, but this is not what we expected from the country’s thinking actor!

The Dhoom Series has a significant impact on Indian Youth. There was a steep rise in incidents of street racing and bike stunts by the younger generation. Moreover, there was also a frenzy of youth modifying their bikes post the movie release.

Known for his courageous outbursts, the former Union Minister, E.V.K.S. Elangovan, will take over the reins of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee on Sunday at a time of a serious crisis and political churning in the State.

Even before his appointment, the party looked to be heading towards a split: there were indications the former Shipping Minister, G.K. Vasan, might revive the Tamil Manila Congress, which his father G.K. Moopanar floated in 1996.

The last time Mr. Elangovan was at the helm in 2000, he had to face a revolt from senior leaders K.V. Thangkabalu and Tindivanam K. Ramamurthy. As it is the case now, he had the backing of the high command, which put down dissent.

Congress sources said Mr. Elangovan’s appointment had come down like a “lightning bolt” on other leaders. Many of them did not even consider him to be in the race.

“We are told Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi met him a few days ago. He has been appointed at Mr. Gandhi’s intervention,” said a senior leader.

The sources said Mr. Elangovan’s name was put forward by the former Defence Minister, A.K. Antony, who headed a committee to analyse the party’s dismal performance nationwide in the Lok Sabha elections.

After the TMC was merged with the Congress in 2002 under the leadership of Mr.Vasan at a huge rally in Madurai presided by party president Sonia Gandhi, Mr. Elangovan became the working president, and the late Kadaladi MLA, S. Balakrishnan, a Kamaraj acolyte, was appointed president of the State unit.

During his previous tenure, Mr. Elangovan, son of Dravidian stalwart E.V.K. Sampath, shot to fame with his bitter criticism of the AIADMK.

In the run-up to the 2001 Assembly polls, he accused the party of aligning with outfits with LTTE sympathies and expressed his uneasiness when Moopanar struck a chord with Ms. Jayalalithaa to keep the communal forces at bay after the DMK joined the BJP government at the Centre.

In 2006, he ruffled the feathers of DMK president M. Karunanidhi by demanding a share of power for the Congress in the State, just like the DMK was part of the Union government as a constituent of the UPA. In fact, during 2006-11, the DMK was in a minority in the Assembly and survived with the support of the Congress.

A senior TNCC leader said that at a time when the party was at its weakest in Tamil Nadu, a candid speaker and bold campaigner like Mr. Elangovan, always identified as a Nehru family loyalist, would enthuse the workers. “The workers should have the confidence that the party is alive. In his last stint, he kept the party vibrant,” he said.

Appropriate choice

With the BJP making swift moves to project itself as an alternative to both the DMK and the AIADMK in the run-up to the 2016 Assembly polls, an effective speaker like Mr. Elangovan is seen as an appropriate choice to lead the party.

Mr. Elangovan has also been keen on taking all sections of the TNCC with him. In fact, even on Saturday morning, he met the outgoing TNCC president, B.S. Gnanadesikan, and requested him to talk Mr. Vasan out of any drastic step at this stage. Later in the evening, Mr. Elangovan met the former Union Finance Minister, Mr. P. Chidambaram here.",discussion,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

In some parallel dimension we aren’t aware of, there must be theatre chains screening Mysskinin Jai Hind 2 and Mani Ratnamin Jai Hind 2 and Selvaraghavanin Jai Hind 2 , and, to avoid confusion, star and director Arjun appends his name to his movie: it’s called Arjunin Jai Hind 2 . Not that there’s much doubt. There’s a scene featuring the national flag, and the plot itself is a rehash of Gentleman , one of Arjun’s biggest hits. The crux is quality education, which the poor don’t have access to. Also from that film are the two heroines — one nice, one naughty. For a while, I was pleasantly surprised by Nandini (Surveen Chawla), a demure Brahmin girl who isn’t draped in a chiffon sari, positioned near industrial fans and asked to sing songs about ants that have invaded her body, like Ranjitha in the original Jai Hind .

The romance between Nandini and Abhimanyu (Arjun) is mature, and when we first glimpse Nandini, we see a thaali . How wonderful, I thought, for this kind of mass- masala entertainer to telegraph, so early on, the unavailability of its heroine. And then we get the second half where a twenty-something student falls for Abhimanyu and imagines a dream duet where he circles around her in a fancy bike as she sways in a miniskirt. It’s a marvel one of our filmmakers hasn’t yet written that best seller How to Have It All .

Genre: Action Director: Arjun Cast: Arjun, Surveen Chawla Storyline: One man's fight to give the poor access to good education Bottomline: Forget coherence or plausibility, but the action's not bad

Arjunin Jai Hind 2 is the kind of film about which you shrug and say, “Well, if you liked Jai Hind …” This isn’t exactly a sequel (the characters are different) but it’s suffused with the same vibe: how to do your bit for the nation while demonstrating your prowess in the martial arts. Don’t laugh. At least I didn’t during the action sequences, which are pretty well done. Arjun looks amazingly fit, and he actually seems to be executing these gravity-defying moves, without the help of wires.

The narrative, too, is spry — at least up to a point — leaping back and forth, thanks to a series of flashbacks used to advance the plot. And then, perhaps realising that his core audience isn’t after education-oriented message-mongering, Arjun unleashes the rocket launchers. The film suddenly (one might say randomly) switches gears — it becomes a prison drama, and then we get a hostage-rescue scenario. But is there any point complaining about coherence or plausibility? If you have to watch a film about a one-man army, you could do worse than watch one with Arjun in it. He totally pulls it off. Of how many fifty-plus leading men can you say that?

What it is about…

Cuckoo , written and directed by Raju Murugan, deals with the romance between two visually challenged persons and the problems they face in life. Produced by Fox Star Studios and The Next Big Film Productions, the film features Dinesh and Malavika Nair in the lead. The music is scored by Santosh Narayanan and the lyrics are by Yugabharathi. The audio of the film was released by actor-director Kamal Haasan and received by actor Suriya.

What they say…

Director Raju Murugan: I started out as a journalist. Then I joined as an assistant under director N. Lingusamy and worked with him on films such as Bheema and Paiya . When I narrated the Cuckoo script to Fox Star Studios, they showed keen interest and gave me creative freedom to make my dream a reality.

Hero Dinesh: I played character roles in films such as Aadukalam and Mounaguru . My first break as hero came through Attakathi and since then I have been called “Attakathi” Dinesh. But I am sure all that will change post- Cuckoo ’s release. In Cuckoo , I play Tamizh, a visually challenged person. I had to attend many workshops to get into the skin of the character. Cuckoo is going to be an important film in my career.

Music director Santosh Narayanan: I began my career with Attakathi . Since then I have scored the music for Pizza and Soodhu Kavvum . Cuckoo is a breezy film, a totally different experience for me. I enjoyed working with Raju Murugan who came up with this superb script. My favourite songs in the album are ‘Aagasathe’ and ‘Manasila Soora Kathey’. I travelled to Australia, worked with some of the world’s top musicians for the music of the movie.

Music highlights: Among the new generation of music directors, Santosh Narayanan occupies a special place as he seems to know the pulse of the audience.

There are six numbers. ‘Manasula Soora Kaathey’ sung by RR and Divya Ramani is the best. ‘Potta Pulla’ sung by RR is an interesting track, while ‘Agasatha’ sung by Kalyani Nair and Pradeep Kumar will make the listeners reach for the rewind button. ‘Kalyanamam Kalyanam’ sung by Antony Dasan with backing vocals by Hema is beautiful, while ‘Kodayila’ sung by Vaikom Vijayalakshmi (a visually challenged singer), Kalyani Nair and Pradeep Kumar is touching. ‘Enda Mapla,’ sung by Gana Bala, Sathish and Dhee, has inspiring lines aimed at youngsters.",discussion,Cuckoo,Chennai,"March 12, 2014","May 19, 2016",Tamil Nadu,100 mm,Rs. 100 crore,10,Thousands of people were displaced from their homes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

His brother, Wing Commander K M Raghuraman, has been selected for the Vayu Sena Medal (Gallantry) for rescuing flood-hit people in Uttarakhand during Operation Rahat.



Arun Kumar was commissioned in the Navy in January 1994 and attended the Staff College in 2009, while Raghuraman joined the Indian Air Force in 1991 as an airman and went on to become an officer in 1996. Later, Raghuraman became a qualified flying instructor from the Flying Instructor School in Tambaram, and served in a UN peacekeeping mission in Congo.



On June 14, 2013, ICGS Varuna was on patrol duty 50 nautical miles south of Minicoy when it was informed about the SOS call given by the MV Asian Express.



The engines, power and communication systems of the merchant vessel with a Maldives flag had failed. As water was gushing into the ship through cracks, the captain of the Asian Express panicked.



Kumar and his men rescued all 22 crew on board the vessel, including four Indians, in an operation that lasted for few hours. “By 7 pm, all of them were safe, but the ship ultimately sank,” the Navy officer, currently associated with the Maritime Warfare Centre in Kochi, told Deccan Herald.



Three days later, his brother Raghuraman, who flies the advanced light-weight helicopter Dhruv, was tasked to position three helicopters at Dehradun to undertake relief operations as a part of Operation Rahat, the massive relief and rescue operation launched by the armed forces in the wake of the devastating floods in Uttarakhand.



Raghuraman, who has been performing the duties of a flying commander since August 2011, and his team flew vigorously in the flood-hit areas, averaging 15 sorties a day, and rescued 490 stranded pilgrims and locals, besides dropping over 50 tons of relief material in the Kedarnath Valley.



They completed the arduous task without an accident or any untoward incident, which is indicative of his meticulous planning and exceptional courage, said an IAF spokesperson.



Anil and Raghu are the eldest of four brothers. Their father, a former accounts officer at Chennai Port Trust, wished four different government jobs for his sons. But only the elders joined the services. The younger brothers preferred the corporate world.

By Keith Schneider, Circle of Blue

SRINAGAR, Uttarakhand, India – On May 24, 2003, as part a national plan to generate more electricity from sources other than coal, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee directed India to pursue one of the most daring energy production campaigns in history.

Vajpayee called on his nation of more than 1 billion people to break through corruption, bureaucracy, and its own doubts and build 162 big hydroelectric power projects by 2025. The dams and power stations would be capable of generating 50,000 megawatts of electricity, the equivalent of 50 big coal or nuclear-fired power plants.

At the time, India’s utility sector had the capacity to generate 108,000 megawatts – one-tenth as much as the electrical sector in the United States. Some 27,000 megawatts, or a quarter of India’s total energy production, came from hydropower.

Vajpayee’s announcement was robed in the formality and national determination comparable to U.S. President John Kennedy’s 1960s plan to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely within a decade. Energy sourced from moving water, Vajpayee said, was desperately needed in a country demoralized by hourly supply disruptions, daily brownouts and regular blackouts.

“Power is a critical input for any economic activity,” the prime minister said. “Its sufficiency is a prerequisite for speeding up India’s economic growth and improving the living standards of all our citizens. Without power, we cannot empower our people in the economic dimension of their lives. It is a major determinant of the quality of life.”

And just like the American space program, not much was discussed in public by the government about the extraordinary risks. Meeting the prime minister’s vision would be technically challenging and extremely dangerous.

Almost all of the new projects — 113 dams and power stations capable of generating 40,000 megawatts of electricity —- were planned for five Himalayan states. Of those, 33 of the new hydropower schemes were targeted for the high mountain valleys in Uttarakhand.

A Himalayan state north of New Delhi that 9 million people call home, Uttarakhand shares borders with China and Nepal. The state, a little smaller than West Virginia, is rich in perpendicular slopes, ample water, turbulent rivers and a history of ecological chaos.

The Mountains Respond

The Himalayas are still forming, still rising — producing one of the most active earthquake zones in the world. The fierce drenching from annual summer monsoons erupt in regular flash floods that undermine the soils of vertical slopes, cause monstrous landslides, and episodically lay waste to big stretches of the region’s serpentine one-way-in, one-way-out highways. In a typical year, dozens of people drown, are buried, or swept away by floods in India’s Himalayan states.

Hubris, Climate Change Magnify A Flood’s Rampage The Uttarakhand flood, according to the Wadia Institute for Himalayan Geology and other scientific agencies, was caused by a convergence of hydrological events, several of them linked to the region’s changing climate. First was the early arrival of the annual monsoon that accelerated snow melting, produced higher than normal rainfall, and then unleashed a cloudburst that dumped at least 300 millimeters (12 inches) of rain on June 16 on the Himalayan ridges that fed the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi river basins. The second event, a direct result of the cloudburst, was the collapse of the banks that retained the waters of Chorabari Lake, a glacial lake fed by rain and snowmelt that was located at 3,960 meters (13,000 feet) and two kilometers (1.2 miles) upsteam of Kedarnath, in the Mandakini River floodplain. Chorabari Lake, 400 meters long by 200 meters wide and up to 20 meters deep (1,300 feet long, 660 feet wide and 60 feet deep) released all of its water in 10 minutes. Like packs of wild dogs clamoring for blood, floodwaters tore down the steep valleys, bounded out of the river channels, and lashed at everything in their path. Kedarnath, Rambara, Gaurikund, much of Sonprayag, and other villages disappeared under the deluge of water, boulders and mud. The rivers clawed at the banks and bluffs, causing over 100 landslides that brought down or damaged more than 1,000 kilometers of highways and caused an unknown number of hotels, homes, shops, and government buildings to fall into the torrent. The estimated death toll ranged from 6,000 (Government of Uttarakhand) to 30,000 (residents and the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology). The Indian Army and emergency and rescue crews transported tens of thousands of stranded people to safety, many by helicopter. Under rolling masses of clouds, it was dangerous work. Twenty rescuers died when one of the choppers crashed. The torrent produced consequences that no engineer anticipated and no Uttarakhand resident had ever seen. A joint study by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank estimated that damage to public infrastructure — roads, water transport, buildings — amounted to nearly $700 million. There has been no formal estimate of the financial damage to the state’s hydropower projects.

Despite the inherent risks, India’s hydro-entranced prime minister and his aides were determined to join China, Bhutan, Nepal, and Pakistan in turning the Himalayas into the Saudi Arabia of hydroelectric energy. In the decade since 2003, India’s hydropower ambitions magnified: 292 big hydro projects are under construction or planned for India’s Himalayan region, according to the Central Electric Authority.

The most turbulent stretches of many Himalayan rivers are scheduled to support five or six new dams, one every 10 kilometers or so. That’s more utility-scale installations than are planned for the world’s other new hydropower production zones – the Rocky Mountains in British Columbia, the Amazon Basin, and the Andes mountains, according to assessments by power authorities in those regions.

“The government wants to put dams on every river in the Himalayas,” said Prakash Nautiyal, a fisheries biologist and for decades a professor of zoology at the Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna Garhwal University in this Alaknanda River city of 150,000 residents. “You know the car culture of Delhi and Mumbai? Bumper to bumper. That’s what they want to do in the Himalayas with dams. Bumper to bumper.”

The unavoidable challenge that India’s engineers and contractors recognized but largely ignored, according to a flurry of government and university studies dating to the early 1990s, was whether the truculent mountain range would accept such intensive industrial intrusion. Late last spring, at the start of the heaviest monsoon season in memory, the Himalayas answered that question.

On June 16 and June 17, 2013 the mountains unleashed two days of monstrous floods that killed about 6,000 people, according to estimates from the Uttarakhand government. Survivors and researchers at the Wadia Institute for Himalayan Geology put the death toll at 30,000. Some 800 battered bodies were recovered and 5,200 others were declared missing.

India defends the estimated death toll of 6,000 based on the applications it reviewed and approved for compensation to families that lost loved ones.

Residents of the Mandakini River Valley interviewed by Circle of Blue said the number of people who died was much higher, perhaps 30,000. That figure is supported by Kapil Kesarwani, a senior research fellow at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, a prestigious government-supported research center in Dehradun, Uttarakhand’s capital.

The flooding wiped away at least six villages, buried dozens of others in mud, wrecked over 1,000 kilometers of highways, and dumped hundreds of buildings into the furious waters.

Maharaj Pandit, a professor in the Department of Environmental Studies at the University of Delhi, and one of India’s independent authorities on hydropower development, was on a field research trip in mid-June when the rains intensified along the Bhagirathi River near Gangotri, a Hindu sacred site high up in a Himalayan pass.

Pandit heard the grind and crash of boulders knocking against each other in the boiling water. It was a new sound, an alarm signaling urgent danger. He gathered his team, terminated the trip, and descended as quickly as he dared out of the mountains where bridges were washing away and roads were vanishing in landslides.

“I had never seen the river in such a rage,” Pandit said. “The river didn’t feel well that day.”

Flood’s Effects on Dam Construction

The June flood also may have drowned India’s long campaign to diversify its energy production with big Himalayan hydropower projects. Circle of Blue was able to document that the flood seriously damaged at least 10 big projects in operation and under construction in Uttarakhand. Another 19 small hydropower projects that generate under 25 megawatts were destroyed.

The findings are based on Circle of Blue’s field reporting in December and January, state and national media dispatches, independent news services, and trade journal notices. We were assisted by the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, a non-profit advocacy group, and reports posted on Down to Earth, an online New Delhi-based environmental news site affiliated with the Centre for Science and Environment.

The Central and state government authorities, and private dam developers, have said next to nothing about the extent of the damage in news releases, on their Web sites, or in public statements. Repeated efforts by Circle of Blue to reach business executives and government regulators by email and phone calls were ignored.

The most heavily damaged projects, according to our findings, include:

The 400-megawatt Vishnuprayag Hydroelectric Project, upriver from Srinagar along the Alaknanda River, was buried beneath 20 meters of rubble that also filled its water storage lake and likely wrecked the mouth of the penstock, the pipe that transports water to the powerhouse downstream.

A second dam under construction on the Mandakini River, the 76-megawatt Phata-Byung Hydroelectric Project, washed away.

The 99-megawatt Singoli-Bhatwari Hydroelectric Project downstream on the Mandakini, a major tributary of the Alaknanda, was so aggressively pummeled by boulders that big chunks of concrete were gouged out of its base and the patches of steel reinforcing rods of two support towers were bent like broken fingers.

The powerhouse and turbines of the 330-megawatt Alaknanda Hydro Power Project in Srinagar were inundated with mud and silt just weeks before it was scheduled to begin operating.

A landslide blocked the end of the water discharge tunnel at the 280-megawatt Dhauliganga project near the border with Nepal. The plug caused a backup that submerged the entire turbine room constructed deep inside the hill near the dam, causing at least $50 million in damage and a shutdown that has still not ended, said dam operators. (See sidebar for more damaged hydropower projects.)

The Uttarakhand flood surprised India with its fury. Energy authorities in Asia and in North America have said the flood caused the most damage to a nation’s hydropower infrastructure since 1975, when rains from a typhoon overwhelmed the Banqiao Dam and 61 smaller dams in central China, killing 171,000 people.

In the history of energy disasters, the Uttarakhand flood struck the global hydropower industry with the same force that the reactor meltdowns at Three Mile Island (U.S. 1979), Chernobyl (Soviet Union, 1986), and Fukushima (Japan, 2011) battered the nuclear power sector.

Uttarakhand: India’ s holy land Uttarakhand is a land of religious pilgrimage. The Ganges River, India’s most sacred, forms where the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi rivers tumble off the snowy peaks of the Himalayas and meet in Devaprayag, 35 kilometers (22 miles) downriver from Srinagar, a university and tourist city of 150,000 residents. Upriver, at elevations that are snow-covered and frozen most of the year, are the 1,000-year-old Badrinath and Kedarnath temples. They are situated in the headwater floodplains of the Alaknanda and Mandakini rivers. Both shrines are as holy to Hindus as the Wailing Wall is to Jews and the Dome of the Rock is to Muslims. The high mountain temples, difficult to reach on dangerous roads and open just a few months a year, serve as sentinels to the magnificence and the treachery of Uttarakhand’s vertical geography. Tens of thousands of people were in the Mandakini flood plain at the height of the annual pilgrimage to Kedarnath temple. The hotels and shops in the villages leading up to the shrine were filled with Hindu pilgrims. Pilgrims also jammed Rambara, and the long footpath from that Mandakini River town to Kedarnath. In addition, some 7,000 to 10,000 workers were in the area carrying pilgrims to the shrine on their mules, serving in the restaurants and hotels, working in the hundreds of religious stalls along the way. Many of those workers were from Nepal or neighboring countries, said residents, and had no documentation. They were in the direct path of the floodwaters. The destruction unfolded quickly, and was catastrophic. Photo © Dhruv Malhotra / Contact Press Images for Circle of Blue Posters of missing Hindu pilgrims are grim ornaments on the walls of buildings that still stand in Sonprayag, downriver on the Mandkini River from the Kedarnath temple. The Uttarakhand government counts almost 600 bodies recovered after the flood and more than 5,000 missing. Residents of the region and a researcher at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology assert that 30,000 people perished in the June flood. Click image to enlarge. Sonprayag, a tourist village just downstream from the Kedarnath shrine, was swept nearly clean away by floodwaters and boulders. Vicky Bhatt, the 22-year-old owner and manager of a guesthouse, said 500 cars were carried into the Mandakini River. At least 25 people who were hiking down from Kedarnath and crossing a hillside just upriver were buried when it slipped into the river. What’s left of Sonprayag now sits directly on the Mandakini’s banks. The riverbed is a new geography of immense boulders. Before the flood, Sonprayag perched on a high bluff, and the river lay so far below — 75 meters (250 feet) by Bhatt’s estimate — that it took half an hour to reach the river’s waters by foot on a narrow and steep path. The tourist trade that supports Sonprayag has essentially dissolved to nothing. “It’s going to take three, four, five years to get back to normal,” Bhatt said. “We can’t believe what happened here. All these stones around us. The river is right there. We’re still stunned by it.” Residents of the Alaknanda basin said there was a religious dimension to the June flood. The Hindu gods, they said, were angry with the tourist trade, intense and growing, in a region of such splendid spiritualism. The case for the religious connection also is strengthened, they said, by two events involving sacred shrines. North of Srinagar, the lake filling up behind the new Alaknanda hydropower dam required the owners to build a concrete platform high enough to keep Dhari, the goddess of power, dry. Dhari is named for an Alaknanda River village and is a noted Hindu shrine. On the day that Dhari was placed on the new platform, June 16, the cloudburst opened on the Himalayan ridges above the Alaknanda and Mandakini rivers, setting off the calamitous flood. The same day, the torrent of water pushed a huge boulder down the Mandakini valley toward Kedarnath. The rock, as big as a truck trailer, slipped sideways and stopped mere feet from the rear of the Kedarnath shrine. The boulder was long enough and heavy enough to serve as a floodwall, diverting the water and debris around the shrine; it saved one of Hinduism’s most sacred sites and dozens of people inside who’d sought shelter.

“The disaster is a costly wake-up call,” said Peter Bosshard, the policy director at International Rivers, a California based non-profit research and river protection group that primarily operates in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. “It shows that nature will strike back if we disregard the ecological limits of fragile regions like the Himalayas through reckless dam building and other infrastructure development. We can only expect such disasters to happen more frequently under a changing climate.”

Court Intervention

India’s Supreme Court reached essentially the same conclusion. Last August 13, eight weeks after the flood, two Supreme Court judges, ruling in a case involving the 330-megawatt Alaknanda Hydro Power Project, issued an order that indefinitely prohibited the Central and state governments from granting any more permits for hydroelectric projects in Uttarakhand. The order essentially shut down new hydropower development in India’s 27th state.

“We are very much concerned about the mushrooming of a large number of hydroelectric projects in Uttarakhand and its impact on the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi river basins,” wrote Justices K.S. Radhakrishnan and Dipak Misra. “Various studies also indicate that in the upper Ganga area, there are large and small hydropower projects. The cumulative impact of those project components like dams, tunnels, blasting, muck disposal, mining, deforestation, etc. on the ecosystem has yet to be scientifically examined.”

The Supreme Court’s intervention also came with a directive to the Ministry of Environment and Forests, the principal regulatory agency, to form a special commission to study the safety and merits of continuing with constructing dams in India’s most important hydropower state.

The commission, appointed last year, is unlikely to issue its conclusions until after the national election results are announced in mid-May. Those findings, and their implementation, also are likely to be overseen by the National Green Tribunal, a four-year-old panel of senior jurists that rules on India’s big environmental cases.

In August, two weeks after the Supreme Court order, the Tribunal said it would hear a case involving flood damage that citizens in Srinagar said was amplified by the Alaknanda hydropower dam. The Tribunal also is monitoring repairs and construction at the damaged Vishnuprayag dam. The Tribunal’s presence is a clear indication that its jurists will closely follow other legal and regulatory aspects of the disaster.

“The Uttarakhand disaster has shown how operating and under construction hydropower projects can increase the vulnerability of the already disaster-vulnerable area,” said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People. “That hydropower projects are not clean, green, cheap and renewable source of energy was known to any discerning observer. The disaster has only strengthened that case. It has shown how much more careful we need to be before taking up any more such projects. If we do not learn these lessons, the price is going to keep climbing. These lessons, incidentally, are valid across the Himalayas, not just for Uttarakhand.”

A Long History of Water-Powered Electricity

India’s experience with hydroelectric energy is among the longest in the world. In 1897, just two years after the world’s first hydroelectric power station opened at Niagara Falls, in the United States, British engineers built the 130-kilowatt Sidrapong Power Station near Darjeeling, in northeast India near the border with Bhutan. It was India’s first water-powered electrical generating plant.

In 1947, when India gained its independence, 508 megawatts of the country’s 1,362 megawatts of electrical generating capacity were gained from hydropower, or 37 percent. Most of the remaining 756 megawatts of generating capacity, or 55 percent, came from coal combustion.

Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s prime minster from 1947 to 1964, encouraged dam construction as a symbol of modernization and rapid industrialization. The Hirakud Dam, completed in 1957 along the Mahanadi River in eastern India, has 307.5 megawatts of generating capacity and is one of the longest dams in the world.

Other Damaged Dams Along with the operational hydropower projects damaged by the 2013 flood, a number of big projects under construction were bullied by the furious waters, some so badly they may never be built.The 520-megawatt Tapovan-Vishnugad dam, under construction on an Alaknanda River tributary and seriously damaged last year by a flash flood, was hit again. The tunnel carrying water to the powerhouse, finished in April 2013, was washed away in June, according to a report in a hydropower trade magazine. Just upriver, the 171-megawatt Lata Tapovan project, under construction and approaching its 2017 opening, was overrun by floodwaters that damaged concrete work and forced at least a year-long delay in its commissioning. The delay could grow longer because the highway network is so broken and unstable it is unsafe to transport heavy equipment that is needed for repairs. Both of the Maneri Bhali projects on the Bhagirathi River were damaged. The 25-year-old Maneri I dam, with a 99-megwatt generating capacity, and the 304-megawatt dam that opened in 2008, were hit hard enough for walls to collapse. Heavy rains also affected dams in other regions of Uttarakhand including the Banbasa project on the Sarda River in eastern Uttrakhand near Nepal. Devandra Singh, an assistant engineer with the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, told reporters that dam operators opened the floodgates after water upstream swelled to 544,000 cubic feet per second, higher than the previous record of 522,000 cubic feet per second. Officials said 48 people died in villages in Nepal and in Uttar Pradesh, an Indian state that shares a border with Uttarakhand. Half a million people in Uttar Pradesh also were driven from their homes by the flood.

Nehru was enthralled by the 225.5-meter (740 feet) Bhakra Nangal dam in Himachal Pradesh, for decades India’s tallest dam. During a visit to the dam in 1956, one of 10 he made to view construction and to dedicate the dam in 1963, Nehru declared, “Bhakra, the new temple of resurgent India, is the symbol of India’s progress.”

Yet building dams at the pace India’s government long sought proved elusive. It wasn’t that India’s leadership lacked resolve. In the 1970s, India established the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation to focus the national government’s technical and financial attention on building hydroelectric dams. Between 1975, when the agency was founded, and 1985, water-generated electricity capacity grew to 14,460 megawatts, almost 7,500 megawatts more than when the new agency was formed. Still, hydropower fell to less than 30 percent of the country’s generating capacity.

Not satisfied, India’s energy and finance authorities approved a more aggressive hydropower development policy, approving a new Electricity Act in 1998 that led in 2003 to an updated law and Prime Minister Vajpayee’s hydropower initiative. Both were established as India was opening its economy to foreign investors and as its leaders eyed the energy-sucking whirlwind in neighboring China as an economic growth model to emulate.

The Central Electric Authority estimated that 50,000 new megawatts was just a third of India’s potential hydropower generating capacity of 150,000 megawatts, more than all but three other nations – China, Brazil and Canada.

New financing, subsidies, and permitting protocols were established to encourage the construction. India’s prime minister and The Ministry of Power, the energy development agency, promoted the idea that hydropower would account for 40 percent of India’s total generating capacity. On paper, and in the glare of intense media attention, the development plan seemed ambitious but achievable.

Uttarakhand – Land of Big Water Projects

More than half of the hydropower generating capacity announced in 2003 was to come from just two states. Uttarakhand, then named Uttaranchal until it became India’s 27th state, was the focus of 33 projects and 5,282 megawatts of generating capacity. Arunachal Pradesh, which borders China, Bhutan, and Myanmar in India’s Northeast region, was set for 42 projects and 27,293 megawatts.

The first four years of the hydropower expansion, 2003 through 2006, went well. Generating capacity nationally jumped sharply to 34,654 megawatts, an increase of 7,654 megawatts in capacity. That was close to the 11,000 megawatts of new generating capacity from coal-fired power plants during the same period.

Global Confrontation Over Water and Energy Intense national programs designed to meet growing global demand for energy are creating a number of mammoth and dangerous energy production zones. As Circle of Blue and the Wilson Center have reported since 2010 in our Global Choke Point Project, tapping those zones yields urgent contests over fresh water supplies, environmental and economic security, and public safety. India is a player in the swirl of these new global energy, water, and food trends. Last year, in our first reports from the Choke Point: India project, Circle of Blue described how India’s policy of providing free energy and water to farmers produced massive grain surpluses that rot in storage facilities in the northwest Punjab region. Meanwhile, so much energy is wasted moving water with electric pumps that the country is unable to mine enough coal in its eastern states, causing fuel shortages in thermal electrical power industry. India’s response to that is not to ask farmers to pay for water and electricity, a change that would temper demand for energy and for water, and ease food surpluses. Rather, India is building highly complex hydroelectric production facilities in the treacherous alpine valleys of the world’s tallest and most perilous mountains. Circle of Blue and the Wilson Center, its Global Choke Point research partner, also have reported on the fierce global contest for energy and water in these production zones: Tar sands mining in Alberta, Canada, and fracking deep shales in the U.S. to produce new streams of oil and natural gas come with manifest evidence of serious damage to land and to water. So much oil-fueled power is needed to convert seawater to fresh water in the Arabian Gulf that several studies, including one by the Qatar Foundation, predict that desalination is a factor in the enormously unsettling economic prospect that Saudi Arabia will cease to be an oil exporter by the early 2030s. A serious contest for scarce water between livestock herders and mining companies has developed in Mongolia’s energy-rich South Gobi desert. China’s Yellow River Basin, a desert region that produces most of the nation’s coal and a fifth of its grain, will run out of water by the early 2020s unless energy and farm production practices undergo formative changes. Australia was gripped by a 12-year drought in the Murray-Darling Basin, its primary food production region, that started in the late 1990s. While the big dry unfolded Australia installed courageous, expensive, and pioneering water conservation equipment, farm production practices, and policy designed to limit the consequences of the next big episode of water scarcity. In the United States, a severe drought in Texas prompted voters last November to approve a $2 billion bond to support water conservation and water supply measures. The federal and California state governments this year agreed to spend $2 billion in relief to aid farmers and cities affected by a three-year drought, and state lawmakers are proposing a $7 billion to $9 billion bond for equipment and construction to improve how the state stores, transports, and conserves fresh water.

Uttarakhand emerged as the most important state for new dams and power stations. In 2005 and 2006, three big hydropower facilities opened, with generating capacity of 1,680 megawatts, or more than a fifth of the country’s new hydro capacity.

But the years from 2007 to 2013 were much more difficult for India’s hydroelectric construction sector. Generating capacity rose to 39,941 megawatts by the end of March 2013, an increase of 5,287 megawatts in six years, or less than 1,000 megawatts of new generating capacity annually. During the same six-year period, India’s overall generating capacity from utilities grew to 223,343 megawatts — a 90,000-megawatt jump, driven principally by 60,000 megawatts of new coal-fired generating capacity.

The causes of the slowdown in hydropower development are numerous, according to assessments by the Central Electric Authority, the Ministry of Power, engineering studies and hydro trade association journals. The difficulty in securing financing for projects that typically range from a low end of $500 million to well over $1 billion, and to move proposals through India’s suffocating permitting bureaucracy, added time and expense. The size of the projects, the extent of land needed for water storage, the numbers of people to be moved, along with the considerable harm to fisheries and local ecology, generated a fierce civic opposition movement, particularly in Uttarakhand and in Arunachal Pradesh.

Then came the forbidding technical difficulties of building and operating big hydroelectric schemes in the Himalayas. They baffled engineers and managers. Constructing a big dam in the Himalayas, it turned out, was as difficult a feat of engineering, design, construction, and industrial management as exists on the planet.

Flash floods wrecked construction schedules and added costs. Landslides buried equipment. It has taken years for engineers and designers to fully understand and deal with the exceptionally high concentrations of mud, silt, and grit carried by Himalayan rivers. The load of ragged-edged grains of quartz and feldspar constantly overwhelm settling basins, and chew up pipes and turbines.

Stories of epic episodes of engineering and construction have become part of the Himalayan narrative. In Himachal Pradesh, west of Uttarakhand, the owners of the 1500-megawatt Nathpa Jhakri Power scheme on the Satluj River finally opened six generating turbines in 2004 after 11 years of construction.

The project was a study in Job-like calamity and persistence. In 1993, just as construction began, a rockslide caused by the monsoon demolished the construction site. Flash floods struck in 2000. In its first years of operation so much silt clogged the dam’s power turbines that the plant was shut down for weeks at a time. New coatings on metal parts, an increase in the height of the dam, and revised operating procedures have helped since.

India’s power authorities and engineers insist they recognize and can manage the risks. Hydropower sector executives say opponents of dam construction are exaggerating the potential harm.

“There has been considerable environmental awakening in India during the past 25 or so years,” wrote Chetan Pandit, a hydropower specialist and former official in India’s Central Water Commission, in an email to Circle of Blue. “We did realize that there was a need and scope to improve the performance of our river valley projects on environmental and social counts. India responded to this requirement by enacting several laws and rules that stipulated an exacting scrutiny of the project design before it was granted environmental clearance. This was a welcome move. But the downside of it was, some enterprising young people saw in this an opportunity to earn a livelihood by opposing all infrastructure, and that includes river valley projects.”

Warnings Ignored

Concern about the safety of the new Himalayan dams didn’t come just from uninformed opponents. In 1996, a report on the Himalaya’s changing ecology by the Center for Science and Environment, the New Delhi-based research group, said: “The Himalayan mountains constitute an ecological system naturally primed for disaster. The deep gorges through which the Himalayan rivers flow convey the impression that the Himalayan valleys would never face floods. Yet these very channels often fail to contain the fury of disastrous floods. Among the most affected valleys are the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi valleys of the Garhwal Himalaya.”

In 2007, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted that the Himalayas were among the regions most affected by the warming atmosphere, a point supported two years later by India’s Ministry of Environment and Forests.

A 2009 report on the risk of floods in Uttarakhand by India’s Comptroller and Auditor General warned that “audit scrutiny of project records revealed that no speciﬁc measures had been planned/designed in any project to cope with the risk of ﬂash ﬂoods. The adverse consequences of such ﬂoods are acute as they cannot only damage the project structures, but can cause loss of life in low-lying downstream areas.”

In 2012, a study commissioned by the Ministry of Environment and Forests recommended that 24 of 39 hydropower projects proposed for Uttarakhand be suspended because of the havoc they would cause for fisheries, and the region’s environment. The Ministry did not act on the recommendation.

Run-of-River Water Diversion Projects Most, but not all of the new dams built and planned in Uttarakhand, are compact in design and meant to be built in high mountain locations. They are based on an old and familiar technology called “run-of-river.”In such projects, a dam – known in India as a barrage – diverts a portion of a river’s flow to a headpond created by the dam. A canal or pipe (known as a head race tunnel) directs the stored water through mountains to turbines in the powerhouse, which is often many kilometers downstream and much lower in elevation. The kinetic energy that develops from the falling water and the pressure in the pipe turns turbines and produces substantial energy. The water then flows back to the river. The commission appointed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests was directed by the Supreme Court to study whether the run-of-river projects amplified the flood’s damage, as critics of Himalayan dams assert. The blasting associated with building dams and the long water transport tunnels, say residents interviewed by Circle of Blue, caused cracks in the foundations of their homes and destabilized already unstable hillsides. Indian environmental groups say that the flood scoured riverbanks where dam construction companies stored huge piles of dirt, mud, and stones – the spoils of excavation. The National Green Tribunal is reviewing whether flood damage in Srinagar was heightened by spoils piles that washed downriver from the Alaknanda hydropower station.

That same year, Uttarakhand’s own Disaster Management Department finished a report that documented the causes and aftermath of a flash flood in the upper reaches of the Bhagirathi River. The disaster, on August 3-4, 2012, was a virtual dress rehearsal for the much bigger flood 10 months later.

Like the 2013 flood, the Bhagirathi flood was triggered by a big monsoon cloudburst. The raging waters and landslides killed 35 people. The highway and mountain road network in the Bhagirathi basin was heavily damaged and thousands of people were stranded for weeks.

The authors of the government report found “widespread devastation in the district and even the district headquarters was not spared by the fury of nature. Heavy precipitation and ensuing flash flood resulted in washing off of a number of vehicular and pedestrian bridges.”

No official heed was paid to these and other studies that clarified hazards from floods and landslides. Instead, the Central Government and Uttarakhand authorities ardently pursued construction of big dams with generating capacity above 25 megawatts, and of many more small dams that generated less than 25 megawatts.

In 2008, the 304-megawatt Maneri Bhalli II project opened on the Bhagarithi River, more than halfway up the turbulent course to its source in the Himalayas.

In 2012, the 400-megawatt Koteshwar project, featuring a 97-meter tall (318 feet) concrete dam, opened on the Bhagarithi River, 22 kilometers (14 miles) downstream from the 1,000-megawatt Tehri Dam, which opened in 2006 and, at 260 meters (855 feet), is India’s tallest dam.

Of the 7,200 megawatts of new hydro generating capacity that India developed from 2006 to 2013, 2,384 megawatts was opened in Uttarakhand, or 32 percent. Of the 21 big hydropower stations commissioned in India since 2006, five opened in Uttarakhand. A sixth big project, the 330-megawatt Alaknanda Hydro Power Project here opened on March 5, 2014, six months after its scheduled start. The June 2013 flood inundated its power station and jammed the turbines with muck.

Uttarakhand also is the site of India’s most aggressive plan for future hydropower development. Five other big dams and 35 projects fewer than 25 megawatts each are under construction. If completed, they’ll add 1,866 megawatts of capacity from large dams, and 180 megawatts from small projects. Moreover, India’s newest Five-Year plan (2012 – 2017) for energy development urges Uttarakhand to build 24 more big dams by 2017 to generate 6,858 megawatts of electricity.

In short, before the flood, Uttarakhand’s hydroelectric development program was rivaled in Asia only by China’s Himalayan provinces.

Whether that remains the state of hydro affairs is not at all secure. There are five big dams under construction in Uttarakhand. It’s unclear if those facilities will be commissioned. A storm of bureaucratic decision making, financial shortfalls, engineering challenges, and the Supreme Court’s expert commission findings can be drawn into a convincing case that India won’t meet its ambitious timeline in Uttarakhand, or in the other Himalayan states.

“The Supreme Court of India ordered the Ministry of Environment and Forests to constitute an expert committee to re-examine certain environmental aspects of the hydro power projects in Uttarakhand, including to examine whether the hydro power projects in any way contributed to the floods,” said Chetan Pandit in an email. “Pending the report by this committee, the court has put a ban on giving further environmental clearances, which has affected 24 ongoing projects. Whether these projects will survive, or whether these will be terminated, will depend to a great extent on the report this committee submits.”

The Supreme Court’s intervention exemplifies the intensifying and conflicting response to the Uttarakhand disaster by India’s political infrastructure. On January 31, 2014, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahugunah resigned at the insistence of his Congress Party leadership, who said his inept management of the rescue and relief operations was unacceptable.

A month before, in December 2013, Jayanthi Natarajan resigned under pressure as head of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. India’s senior leadership, according to press accounts, were dismayed by the slow pace for reviewing and approving permits for big industrial projects, including for hydroelectric schemes. She was replaced by Veerappa Moily, a senior leader of the Oil and Petroleum Ministry, and a proponent of hydroelectric development.

In interviews, high government officials said they anticipated that neither the Uttarakhand disaster, nor the findings of the Ministry of Environment and Forests study commission, would significantly alter India’s strategy of aggressive Himalayan hydropower development. H.L. Bajaj, the former chairman of the Central Electric Authority, said the risks of India’s hydropower strategy are worth the gain of securing more electricity. “Perhaps we will make adjustments to designing hydro schemes,” Bajaj said in an interview in his New Delhi office. “I don’t foresee that India will stop building these projects.”

Produced by South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People

Ram Prasad Lal, a director in the India Meteorological Department, asserted that until the June flood — what he called a “100-year event” — hydro schemes had proved resilient to heavy Himalayan rainfall. Opponents to Himalayan hydropower dams questioned that view. They said that the numbers of dams being washed out of high Himalayan valleys is increasing. Floods in Nepal in 1981 and 1985 destroyed new hydroelectric projects. Two dams were lost in a 1982 flood in Bhutan. Two more dams washed away in Arunachal Pradesh in the last decade, according to Partha Jyoti Das, programme head at Aaaranyak, a science research organization in Guwahati, and co-author of an influential report on the hazards of Himalayan hydropower projects. “It’s becoming more common in this region. People just don’t hear about these disasters,” said Das.

Nine months after the Uttarakhand disaster, India’s regulatory and power development agencies ardently pursue construction, permits, and financing for more big hydro projects in four other Himalayan states, and for at least two projects in Bhutan. One hydro scheme under construction since 2007, the 330-megawatt Kishanganga Hydroelectric Project on the Kishanganga River in Jammu and Kashmir, prompted a dispute with Pakistan, which is concerned about the water diverted from the river for generating power.

Pakistan brought a case to the Hague’s Permanent Court of Arbitration, which ruled last year that India was entitled to just a minimal flow for electricity. How that ruling affects India’s relationship with Pakistan, or the generating capacity of a project due to be completed in 2016, is a new facet of the ecological and diplomatic tumult India’s hydropower strategy is now generating.

More Seasons of Menace

In December and January, the dry season in Uttarakhand, the Alaknanda and Mandakini Rivers are clear and blue with no angry crest at all. Yet both rivers, and several more affected by the June flood, reflect the grimness of what happened, and the strain of what could easily happen again later this year.

The road transport network is not fully repaired. Transportation is so difficult, newspapers reported in December, that 1,200 tons of food could not be distributed and rotted in place. Hundreds of people are homeless.

The gathering danger is not close to being lifted from Uttarakhand’s magnificent and hardened Himalayan valleys. So much silt and mud and boulders washed off the hillsides during the June 2013 flood that they filled the riverbeds. The rivers of the Alaknanda and Bhaghirati basin run now on new bottoms that are 5 to 35 meters higher than they were before the flood, according to residents and the Geological Survey of India.

That means that unless rubble is removed, which amounts to a monumental and costly excavation project that has not started, the approaching 2014 monsoon this summer will easily overflow river banks and could cause more terrible flood damage to dams and to communities. The Himalayas, like a daredevil avenger, is exacting its vengeance with lingering seasons of menace.

Residents of Ayapakkam near Ambattur live in constant fear of flooding during every spell of rains.

The reason for the fear is the refusal by authorities to take action against encroachments in the vicinity of the lake. These encroachments block the weir, a structure that allows the surplus water to escape the catchment areas and cause the flooding of several residential communities after every heavy spell of rain, they said.

Like many other waterbodies around the city, the Ayapakkam lake too is a picture of neglect as it is covered with overgrown vegetation.

B. Vignesh, a resident of Ayapakkam, said that whenever the lake gets full, the surplus water inundates several areas, including Bhavani Nagar, Sivasakthi Nagar, TNHB quarters, Kalaivanar Nagar and Kulasekaran Nagar. Residents alleged that two ponds that were part of the chain of tanks that received water from the Ayapakkam lake had been closed. This also led to more areas getting covered in water.

Uma Kannan, former councillor of the erstwhile Ambattur municipality, said that at least 15,000 families would be affected due to flooding. Streets get slushy as most of them lack blacktopping. The problem has not occurred so far in low-lying areas as the lake has less water. As the area lacks a proper underground drainage network, residents of some houses and TNHB quarters let their sewage into the lake and the nearby canals.

Some encroachments that were removed three years ago along the bund have returned now, she said.

A.M. Durai Veeramani, president of federation of residents’ welfare association said that the lake had to be desilted and its bund strengthened. It is a major source of groundwater recharge to the locality. The water level dips to 100 feet-150 feet during peak summer.

According to Ayapakkam panchayat, nearly 14 borewells depend on the lake for street supply. About 50,000 people are supplied with two lakh litres of water daily from these borewells.

The panchayat does not have enough funds to desilt or deepen the big lake and depends on the Water Resources Department to improve the lake.

Officials of the Water Resources Department said that they have sought the details of encroachments from the Tiruvallur collectorate.

The horsemen refused to take them downhill. So did the porters. They had seen rains in the hills, but this downpour was something else. With no other choice, 16-year-old Libni Garg and family decided to trek down to base camp Gauri Kund from Kedarnath in the state of Uttarakhand. A peaceful pilgrimage suddenly took a different turn on the morning of June 16, 2013. “It was freezing…it rained so much that raincoats were pointless,” says Libni, speaking over phone from Dehradun. “We finally managed to hire two porters.” Libni’s story of struggle and survival will be featured in Himalayan Tsunami , a documentary that will be aired on the Discovery Channel.

Boulders cracked and trundled past them; bridges collapsed and rains beat against them with a vengeance. Libni and family moved on, desperate to reach safe ground. Once at Rambada, located 7 km from the base, they decided to rest for the night. Little did they know of the danger that awaited them the next morning.

Rains poured all night while they slept fitfully. Libni’s family was stranded. “The owner of the lodge in which we stayed was over 70 years old. He told us that not once in his lifetime had he seen floods rise over the first step of the building. But that day, water had reached the fifth step,” she recalls. The locals had never experienced such rains — there was chaos everywhere. “We were compelled to walk against the stream back to Kedarnath,” says Libni.

It was during this trek that Libni was witness to something she would never forget. A wall of water thundered past them, dragging along houses, utensils, cattle… As thousands lost their lives and everything they held close to the floods, Libni and her family walked on, forcing themselves not to look back. For it was the best they could do for their survival. “I asked my dad where we were going. And he said ‘I don’t know’,” says Libni. “That was when I got really scared.”

They reached level ground at last and rested their tired feet when suddenly — “A local shouted ‘Run, water!’” They did so without second thought. What followed were long hours of starvation; sleepless nights; and journeys that seemed to have no end or purpose. “Even the food packets the Government dropped from helicopters did not reach us,” says Libni. For, they were stranded in the remotest of corners. Help arrived at last on the morning of June 20 — they were airlifted by the Army along with other survivors. For Libni, who studies in a boarding school in Dehradun, the experience taught her the value of life. “I won’t take anything for granted,” she says. “Problems that seemed big before appear trivial now.” Will she be going to Uttarakhand again? “No,” she says. “I don’t think I’m going back.” Himalayan Tsunami, to be aired at 9 p.m. on December 23, looks at “what really happened” during the Uttarakhand disaster and “why”.",flood,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 20, 2013","['Kedarnath', 'Rudraprayag', 'Chamoli', 'Pithoragarh', 'Uttarkashi']","['Kedarnath: 300 mm', 'Rudraprayag: 250 mm', 'Chamoli: 200 mm', 'Pithoragarh: 150 mm', 'Uttarkashi: 100 mm']","['1,000+ people killed', '100,000+ people displaced', 'Rudraprayag bridge destroyed', 'Kedarnath temple damaged', 'Infrastructure damaged']",,"['Loss of lives', 'Loss of property', 'Disruption of livelihoods', 'Environmental damage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe.

Bitter memories of December 26, 2004, were relived in the coastal villages of Chennai, Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Kanyakumari and Tuticorin districts when the ninth anniversary of tsunami was observed on Thursday.

In Nagapattinam, the town which lost the largest number of people, next of kin were still grappling with the loss of their loved ones. For 38-year-old Anbarasi, who had lost her young son to the killer waves, time is yet to play the healer. The fishing hamlets were littered with hoardings bearing eulogies of the dead and commemorated memories of loved ones. Occasional wails, solemn silences, and choked tears punctuated the sordid atmosphere.

And for the children of Annai Sathya Home for tsunami orphans, who were too young to cope with a loss so intense, this annual floral tribute stoked emotions forcing them to relive those times and come to terms with their loss.

Earlier, tributes were paid at the Tsunami memorial erected in memory of 6,045 victims. Similar tributes were paid at the Keechankuppam memorial.

Fishermen – from Arockiapuram to Neerodi in Kanyakumari and Periyathalai to Vembar in Tuticorin - stayed away from sea as a mark of respect to the hundreds of people swallowed by killer waves.

As many as 43,804 families, comprising 1.88 lakh people, were affected in the coastal areas of Kanyakumari district.

People offered floral homage at the ‘Tsunami Stupi’ at Triveni Sangamam Park in Kanyakumari. Special prayers were offered at the Anthirayas Church at Manakudi, St. Alex Church in Kottilpadu and Kanikkai Matha Church in Colachel, places of mass burials.

Fishermen, along with their family members, offered flowers to the ‘Tsunami Stupi’ at Colachel, Kottilpadu and Manakudi. Residents of Kottilpadu took out a silent procession and lit candles.

In Tuticorin, fisher folk, mostly clad in black, took out a silent procession towards Threspuram coast and paid floral homage in the shore. The mourners carried candles and flowers.

Children of a special school run by National Child Labour Programme at Inigo Nagar conducted a candle light prayer.

“Nine years after the tragedy, coastal families are slowly returning to the mainstream. Their social status has also improved, post-tsunami, due to mechanisation of fishing craft. In future, the focus should be on education, health and hygiene,” says Rev. Fr.

The Tambaram Sanatorium, to most people, is a railway station, the sanatorium having long ago made way for a hospital. But its story, or that of its founder Dr. David Jacob Aaron Chowry-Muthu, is interesting.

Savarimuthu was born in 1864 and of his early life there are no details. He proceeded to England to qualify in medicine and was, by the 1890s, an MD and an MRCS. Fighting the colour bias and being one of the earliest commoners from India to settle in England must have been a challenge. But he was more than successful. By 1891, he was Chowry-Muthu and had courted and married a British woman – Margaret Fox.

In medicine, Dr. Chowry-Muthu specialised in pulmonary tuberculosis. In an era when BCG was yet unknown, he was a strong advocate of the open air and clean surroundings cure for the dreaded disease, which meant the sequestering of patients in sanatoria. By the early 1900s, he was physician-in-charge of the Inglewood Sanatorium at the Isle of Wight. By 1910 or so, Dr. Chowry-Muthu had established the Hill Grove sanatorium at Mendip Hills, Somerset. One of his high profile patients, albeit for a brief while in 1917, was Srinivasa Ramanujan, the mathematician.

Another of Dr. Chowry-Muthu’s friends was Mahatma Gandhi, who shared his views on nature cures. Perhaps due to the latter’s influence, Dr. Chowry-Muthu began spending increasing amounts of time in India from 1920 onwards. It was then that he hit upon the idea of beginning a sanatorium for tubercular patients. He acquired 250 acres of land in Tambaram and on April 9 1928, the sanatorium, with 12 beds was inaugurated by Sir C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar.

Unfortunately, the doctor’s wife died in England the same year. By 1930, he was keen to go back and requested the government to acquire the sanatorium. In 1937, with a sympathetic Congress ministry in place, this was done. Among the first patients post the government acquisition was a student at the Law College. Recovering, he went on to have a stellar career in law and politics; I allude to former Supreme Court judge V.R. Krishna Iyer, happily with us at 98.

The government upgraded the sanatorium in 1946 to 750 beds. BCG rendered sanatoria superfluous in the 1960s, and the Tambaram facility became a hospital for terminally ill TB patients. In 1986, it was renamed the Government Hospital of Thoracic Medicine. In 1993, it became the first facility to admit patients with HIV.",discussion,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

At least 130 people have been killed and 70,000 others left stranded in devastating flash floods to hit northern India, private television channel NDTV has reported.

The channel said on Wednesday that thousands of houses in the states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh had been swept away in the floods and authorities were using helicopters to evacuate people and drop essential food supplies.

Northern India has witnessed torrential rains at least three times more than usual over the past week ever since the annual monsoon broke a fortnight ahead of schedule, leaving thousands of pilgrims and tourists stranded, officials said.

“The state government and the army are trying to rescue thousands of tourists who are stranded near the submerged valleys and Hindu shrines,” said Jaspal Arya, the disaster relief minister of Uttarakhand.

Arya said portions of the famous Hindu temple, Kedarnath, were washed away on Tuesday and about 10,000 pilgrims were in need of rescuing.

But many are still stuck and it could take us three more days to rescue all of them by Jaspal Arya

“The Kedarnath temple is submerged in mud and slush. We just hope that it does not collapse,” Arya told the AFP news agency.

Authorities have cancelled pilgrimage trips, fearing further rains and landslides in the state, often referred to as the “Land of the Gods” because of its many Hindu temples and Hindu religious sites.

Officials in Uttarakhand, the worst-hit state, said about 200 cars, two earthmoving equipment and even a parked helicopter had been swept away by floods.

The torrential rains began lashing the region on Saturday and local officials said 40 relief camps had been set up to provide food and water to locals and tourists.

On Tuesday, 250 people were rescued by air force helicopters from different parts of the state and many were moved to the relief camps.

“But many are still stuck and it could take us three more days to rescue all of them,” Arya added.

The monsoon, which India’s farming sector depends on, covers the subcontinent from June to September, usually bringing some flooding.

I am standing inside a temple in Rameshwaram that is built in the middle of the sea, linked to land by a short stretch of road.

There is no deity in this temple. Inside the small inner sanctum, two footprints carved in stone are etched on a chakra. Lord Ram had paused here in his journey to Sri Lanka to rescue Sita, and left his footprints here. This is why the temple is called Ramar Padam (Rama’s footprints).

I climb a flight of steps to the temple’s terrace. The sea spreads out in front of me. The white flecks of its waves lick the shore. This was where Ram had his first glimpse of Sri Lanka, says the priest, pointing to the far horizon.

Crumbled remains of homes and buildings

Dhanushkodi, located barely 20km from Rameshwaram town, is neither an ordinary beach nor a tourist hang-out.

Like every other town located in and around Rameshwaram, Dhanushkodi too has a mythical connect to Ramayan. Ram broke the bridge to Lanka (Ramar Sethu) with a single stroke from his bow after the war, so that no other army could reach Lanka to invade it. That’s why the town is called Dhanushkodi, from Ram’s bow.

View Full Image The remains of the church’s entrance

I decide to head out to this deserted town to see what remains of it today. Despite the short distance, getting to Dhanushkodi from Rameshwaram isn’t easy. I take an auto to Moonram Chathiram, a few kilometres outside Rameshwaram town. From here, I climb onto one of the small trucks parked by the beach that ferries the few tourists who do visit the ruins.

During the 10km drive to Dhanushkodi, the bumpy road takes us through wastelands layered with sand. Thorny shrubs are scattered about. Suddenly the road’s tar surface disappears from beneath us. We are now driving on an unpaved surface.

The path is filled with huge puddles of water that splash as our tyres wade through. We are soon driving along the Indian Ocean, and through marshlands that form backwaters of the sea.

There isn’t a vehicle or house for miles around—and scarily for me, neither is there a road to be seen. Slowly, to my relief, the waters subside, and patches of land emerge. Shrubs and the trees sprout again from this waste land.

We are soon on a muddy road. Some broken monuments pop up by the sea shore. There are no signboards, but perhaps these abandoned ruins are a rather apt way for a town like Dhanushkodi to introduce me to its story.

Floating stones were used in building the Ram Setu bridge in the Ramayan

Dhanushkodi used to connect India and Sri Lanka with a railway and ferry service. A train used to leave Madras (now Chennai) and reach a pier near Dhanushkodi, from where passengers boarded a ferry to Sri Lanka. This arrangement was called the Boat Mail. On the night the storm struck the town, this fateful train had been devoured by the water, along with all the passengers on board.

I see broken bricks scattered everywhere. I walk to the most photographed monument in Dhanushkodi—the ruins of a church. It stands tall and roofless. I can still see the outline of the spire. This church is the only ruin in Dhanushkodi which still preserves some traces of its former appearance.

I spot a few fishermen heading out into the ocean. They live in makeshift huts here at times, although their hometowns are the villages around Rameshwaram town.

Pichimuthu is one of the fishermen. He is in his late 60s with a white flowing beard, and his skin tanned by the sea. Born in Dhanushkodi, he was eight years old when the storm surge struck the town. He was away from Dhanushkodi that night. When he came back, his home had disappeared. The sea had taken away his town, and his family, friends, and everyone he knew had disappeared.

The sunset traces Pichimuthu’s silhouette as he gazes out to the sea. The waves gently flow and ebb, showing no sign of that night when they had raged with an unstoppable fury.

Misery and uncertainty continued to plague thousands of villagers rendered homeless in the interior areas of Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Pithoragarh even as teams of the Army, ITBP, NDRF and State police rescued over 10,000 pilgrims on Sunday. The remaining 7,000 odd pilgrims would be rescued soon, authorities hope.

The rescue operations were hampered by mild showers in places like Dehradun and Joshimath. The Met office has predicted more rains on Monday and Tuesday.

The Director General of Police has ordered all local police chiefs to escort pilgrims trekking their way out to avoid mishaps. Special security would be provided to women, he said.

Many pilgrims and residents wondered why the government had not made proper arrangements for the Char Dham Yatra even after 12 years of formation of Uttarakhand. Disasters due to cloudbursts, flash floods and landslides have been common but the authorities seemed content with small temporary measures after each disaster, said Renu D. Singh of the Samadhan Women Helpline.

Sarita and Neetu, both social activists, wondered why neither the Bharatiya Janata Party nor the Congress allowed the Vidhan Sabha sessions to function. “Important Bills and even the Budget are passed without discussions. Does the electorate elect the MLAs for this,” they asked.

Jagdish Chandra Jakhmola, a retired teacher, wanted the MLAs not to disturb Vidhan Sabha proceedings and seriously debate how disasters could be mitigated in Uttarakhand. The Centre should also make efforts by forming a group of well meaning experts to suggest measures to minimise losses caused by natural calamities and also pitch in with liberal funds for repairing or reinforcing infrastructure, he said.

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, after consulting with religious leaders such as Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati, ordered the officials to immediately send a team to Kedarnath to clear the area of debris and cremate the dead bodies lying there with traditional rituals after postmortem and collection of DNA samples. A ‘mahayagya’ will be held in Haridwar on the 13th day of the tragedy for the peace of the departed souls, Mr. Bahuguna said.

Mr. Bahuguna also said the rehabilitation of Kedarnath shrine was a top priority of the gand it will be carried out after taking suggestions from the Archaeological Survey of India.

Mr. Bahuguna said that the welfare of the disaster-hit villagers was equally important and necessary rations and medical care was being rushed there. “The damaged roads and bridges were making access to the remote areas difficult,” he said.

Second survey

Mr. Bahuguna ordered the rescue teams to make a second survey of areas from where pilgrims had been rescued to make sure no one was left out. The Chief Minister wanted the officials to keep a backup rescue plan ready in view of forecasts of more rains in the coming days.

Union Minister Harish Rawat, who trekked about 18 km from Rudraprayag to Augustmuni on Sunday morning, told The Hindu over phone that devastation in the villages was extensive and it would take a lot of time to bring things back to normal. Mr. Rawat who visited Gauchar also said the ITBP was doing an excellent job in the village-to-village search for survivors in the Kedarnath-Lambagarh area. A large number of houses, hotels, vehicles and agriculture fields have been washed away, Mr. Rawat said.

Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, along with senior Congress leaders Moti Lal Vora and Ambika Soni, reviewed the relief centres set up in Rishikesh and Dehradun.

Mr. Hooda said that 50,000 blankets would be sent for people stranded at various place in Uttarakhand and, out of these, 25,000 blankets had already been dispatched from Panipat on Sunday. He said that buses of Haryana Roadways had been deployed to carry rescued persons from Dehradun, Rishikesh and Haridwar to their destinations free of cost.

The Baluakot and Jualjiwi villages in district Pithoragarh were some of the worst-affected with some of the villagers trekking through hazardous areas to the district headquarters and taking shelter in the homes of relatives or friends. Pramod Tamta who reached the district headquarters said that nearly half of the houses, shops and agricultural fields in Baluakot and Jualjiwi had been washed away.

As many as eight lakh farmers of Srikakulam district lost all their hopes with heavy heavy rain and floods causing damage to crops in two lakh acres.

There is little chance to save standing crops such as paddy, sugar cane, banana, coconut and other varieties with the rains causing havoc in the district. Almost all the mandals received around 25 cm rainfall till 8.30 am on Thursday

As many as 600 villages were marooned due to floods to Mahendratanaya, Bahuda rivers. It is estimated that around 1.2 lakh people were affected in Itchapuram, Kanchili, Kaviti, Mandasa, Sompeta and Vajrapukotturu mandals.

Train services hit

Rail and road network between AP and Odisha got disrupted as flood water flowing over the track in Itchapuram. Many trains were either delayed or cancelled. Hundreds of passengers were stranded at Itchapuram, Palasa and Srikakulam stations. East Coast Railway authorities are trying to restore tracks in many areas. The train movement will begin only after thorough inspection of the route.

Vehicular movement was disrupted with flood water flowing heavily on highways too. Following breach to causeway near Chapara, road network between Parlakimidi and Meliyaputti got disrupted. Life was thrown completely out of gear in Sompeta, Vajrapukotturu, and Kanchili areas as rain water entered houses.

The district administration tried to provide water and food packets to flood victims.

Collector Saurabh Gaur monitored the flood situation and asked all the special officers to be alert till normalcy was restored in the affected villages.

Review meet

He conducted a review meeting at the Collectorate and directed health teams to reach flood affected areas to check outbreak of prevent communicable diseases. The Collector declared holiday for schools and colleges in the district on Thursday.

Mr.Gaur said there was no human loss in the flood affected areas. However, the situation was grim in Jagannadhapuram, Patasasanam, Birlangi and Totavooru of Itchapuram mandal. The irrigation officials requested their counter parts in Odisha not to release water from Balagatti Dam since it would further inundate many areas of Itchapuram.

The situation was reportedly to be grim in Vajrapukotturu mandal as Bhimasamudram Gedda and Padmanabham Gedda are in spate. Mandasa-Haripuram villages were also badly affected.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday announced a financial assistance of Rs. 1,000 crore to Uttarakhand for disaster relief. Of this, Rs. 145 crore would be released immediately.

In a statement made after an aerial survey of the hilly regions of the State, where torrential rains wreaked havoc and caused extensive damage in the past few days, Dr. Singh said he had directed all Central agencies to render all possible assistance in their capacity to the State. UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi accompanied the Prime Minister during the aerial survey.

Dr. Singh announced ex-gratia assistance of Rs. 2 lakh each to the families of those killed and Rs. 50,000 each to those who injured from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF).

Further, the Centre would provide from the PMNRF ex-gratia assistance of Rs.1 lakh each to those whose houses were completely destroyed and Rs. 50,000 each to those whose houses were damaged.

“We saw for ourselves the large scale devastation that has been caused in the State. Our hearts go out to the families of those who have lost their lives and those who have suffered injury or loss of property in this huge tragedy,” the Prime Minister said. The priority for the authorities was to rescue the stranded persons and provide relief to the affected people.

“Assessing the magnitude of the losses, both in terms of lives lost and houses destroyed, or the damage to buildings, roads and other infrastructure, is an exercise that will take some more time,” he said. Dr. Singh added that both he and Ms. Gandhi were distressed by the devastation caused by flash floods and rains.

While estimates put the death toll at 102, it was feared that loss of lives could be much higher. So far, more than 10,000 people had been rescued and were being provided food, clothing and shelter. Many persons were still stranded. The maximum damage was in Kedarnath and its vicinity, Dr. Singh noted.

The Central and State governments would continue to work in close coordination to ensure that every possible effort was made, not only to provide immediate relief to the affected people, but also to help them reconstruct their lives, Dr. Singh said.",solution,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 20, 2013","['Kedarnath', 'Rudraprayag', 'Chamoli', 'Pithoragarh', 'Uttarkashi']","['Kedarnath: 300 mm', 'Rudraprayag: 250 mm', 'Chamoli: 200 mm', 'Pithoragarh: 150 mm', 'Uttarkashi: 100 mm']","['10,000 houses destroyed', '100 bridges damaged', '13,000 km of roads damaged', '102 people killed']",,"['Thousands of people stranded', 'Major disruption to transportation', 'Loss of livelihoods', 'Environmental damage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

It is one week since Uttarakhand’s worst disaster in living memory. Flash floods resulting from extremely intense rainfall swept away mountainsides, villages and towns, thousands of people, animals, agricultural fields, irrigation canals, domestic water sources, dams, roads, bridges, and buildings — anything that stood in the way.

A week later, media attention remains riveted on the efforts to rescue tens of thousands of pilgrims and tourists visiting the shrines in the uppermost reaches of Uttarakhand’s sacred rivers. But the deluge spread far beyond the Char Dhams — Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath — to cover the entire State. The catchments of many smaller rivers also witnessed flash floods but the media has yet to report on the destruction there. Eyewitness accounts being gathered by official agencies and voluntary organisations have reported devastation from more than 200 villages so far and more affected villages are being reported every day. Villagers whose homes, lands and animals have been swept away by the floods are in a state of shock trying to imagine day-to-day survival without their basic livelihood assets.

Distorted coverage

The national media’s focus on the plight of tourists has grossly distorted the true nature of the tragedy even in the Char Dham area. It has not reported on the fate of the thousands — almost all male — who come from the villages in these valleys (and elsewhere) to earn a major part of their families’ annual income on the yatra routes during the tourist season. They help run the dhabas that line the entire 14 km trek route from GauriKund to Kedarnath; they sell raincoats, umbrellas, canes, walking sticks, soft drinks, water bottles, home-made snacks and other supplies. On their backs, they carry children, the old, the infirm and tourists who are simply unfit and out of shape to walk the entire route. They run along the path with their ponies or horses carrying yatris.

Local residents tell of village after village in the Mandakini valley below Kedarnath resounding with wails from homes whose boys and men have not yet returned and are now feared dead. One village near Guptkashi alone counts 78 missing.

The tragedy of the families dependent on religious tourism for much of their annual income is compounded by the fact that the yatra season is over for the year, and is unlikely to resume even next year given the destruction of the roads and bridges in the upper reaches. Several thousand Char Dham valley families will now fall below the poverty line. Till the revival of the yatras, what will be the alternative sources of employment for the newly unemployed? Most likely we will see increased male outmigration from the region.

Last week’s disaster not only spelt doom for thousands of household economies but also dealt a grievous blow to Uttarakhand’s lucrative religious tourism industry. With the media focus almost exclusively on the fate of pilgrims, the scenes of the deluge and its aftermath will linger on in public memory, making the revival of tourism doubtful in the foreseeable future. The abject failure of the State government, political leaders and the administration is therefore likely to impoverish the State coffers too.

The scale of participation in the kaanwar festival that starts in July — when about a million people throng to the banks of the Ganga at Hardwar over a couple of weeks and take back Gangajal to their homes — will be revealing. The pressure on the State government will continue through September when the Nanda Devi Raj Jaat (yatra), a once-in-12-years event, is scheduled. A detailed discussion on the future of Uttarakhand’s tourism industry is not possible here but it is clear that it requires a radical overhaul. With the ineptness of the State government now fully exposed, new policies for the revival of tourism in Uttarakhand must follow an open debate.

Not a ‘freak’ incident

The impact of the floods on Uttarakhand’s tourism leads to larger questions of what kind of development Himalayan States should pursue. Before delving into that, it is important to understand the nature of the rainfall that deluged the State. Already several voices are arguing that the deluge is a random, ‘freak’ event. Odisha’s super cyclone in 1999, torrential rains in Mumbai in 2005, and now the Uttarakhand downpour constitute three clear weather related events in less than 15 years, each causing massive destruction or dislocation in India. These can hardly be called ‘freak’ events.

Several reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have repeatedly warned that extreme weather incidents will become more frequent with global warming. We are already riding the global warming curve. We will have to take into account the likelihood of more frequent extreme weather events when planning for development, especially in the fragile Himalayan region where crumbling mountains become murderous.

In the 1990s, when the demand for a separate State gained momentum, at conferences, meetings, workshops and seminars, Uttarakhandi people repeatedly described the special character of the region. Consciousness created by the pioneering Chipko Andolan raised the hopes of village women that their new State would pursue a green development path, where denuded slopes would be reforested, where fuel wood and fodder would be plentiful in their own village forests, where community ownership of these forests would provide their men with forest products-based employment near their villages instead of forcing them to migrate to the plains, where afforestation and watershed development would revive their dry springs and dying rain-fed rivers, and where the scourge of drunken, violent men would be overcome.

Year after year — in cities, towns and villages — they led demonstrations demanding a mountain state of their own. Theirs was a vision of development that would first enhance the human, social and natural capital of the State. Recalling the tremendous worldwide impact of the Chipko movement, Uttarakhandi women dreamed of setting yet another example for the world of what people-centric development could look like.

But in the 13 years after statehood, the leadership of the State has succumbed to the conventional model of development with its familiar and single-minded goal of creating monetary wealth. With utter disregard for the State’s mountain character and its delicate ecosystems, successive governments have blindly pushed roads, dams, tunnels, bridges and unsafe buildings even in the most fragile regions.

In the process, denuded mountains have remained deforested, roads designed to minimise expenditure rather than enhance safety have endangered human lives, tunnels blasted into mountainsides have further weakened the fragile slopes and dried up springs, ill-conceived hydropower projects have destroyed rivers and their ecosystems, and hotels and land developers have encroached on river banks.

Yes, wealth has been generated but the beneficiaries are very few — mainly in the towns and cities of the southern terai plains and valleys where production investments have concentrated. In the mountain villages, agricultural production has shrivelled, women still trudge the mountain slopes in search of fodder, fuel wood and water, and entire families wait longingly for an opportunity to escape to the plains.

Last week’s floods have sounded an alarm bell. To pursue development without concern for the fragile Himalayan environment is to invite disaster. Eco-sensitive development may mean a slower monetary growth rate but a more sustainable and equitable one.

A study published in Nature Climate Change, has compiled a list of cities most vulnerable to coastal flooding. Taking in consideration elevation, population distribution and available flood protection from 136 coastal cities worldwide, in addition to forecasts of sea level rise and ground sinking due to groundwater depletion, the study determines that if no mitigating steps are taken, coastal flooding will cause damage totaling $1 trillion annually by the year 2050.

Topping the list as the most vulnerable city is Guangzhou, China, followed by Mumbai and Kolkata in India, Guayaquil, Ecuador and Shenzen, China. Almost all cities at the highest risk of flooding damage were in North America or Asia.

The top 20 most vulnerable cities are:

Guangzhou, China Mumbai, India Kolkata, India Guayaquil, Ecuador Shenzen, China Miami, Florida, USA Tianjin, China New York, New York — Newark, New Jersey, USA Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam New Orleans, Louisiana Jakarta, Indonesia Abidjan, Ivory Coast Chennai, India Surat, India Zhanjiang, China Tampa—St. Petersburg, Florida, USA Boston, Massachusetts, USA Bangkok, Thailand Xiamen, China Nagoya, Japan

Technology-driven efforts are on to crowdsource information using the Internet and other communication channels and integrate it into online maps to help manage the aftermath of the natural calamity that has beset Uttarakhand.

The international experience in recent years has proved that ‘crisis mapping’ can make a difference to disaster situations.

One such Uttarakhand flood relief effort, that aims to make use of ‘digital volunteers’ in India and other parts of the world to aggregate information from diverse sources and make it more useful and actionable has been launched by Hemant Purohit, a Crisis-Response Coordination researcher at the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis), Wright State University.

And there exists an International Network of Crisis Mappers, which includes members with different skill sets, and experience in the use of tools covering crowdsourcing, mapping, use of aerial and satellite imagery, geospatial platforms, advanced visualisation and computational and statistical models.

What the volunteers are doing is to monitor different channels of information on Uttarakhand, including official sources, blogs, social media, non-governmental organisations, public networks and the news media to generate ‘situation reports’ and also update with vital information an online crisis map set up by the >Google Crisis Response team (http://google.org/crisismap/2013-uttrakhand-floods? gl=in). The map has information on rescued people, cleared areas, people stranded, relief camps, medical centres, road networks and so on.

Information flow will gather momentum as the repair and restoration of the mobile phone network progresses in Uttarakhand.

Google had also set up an instance of its webapp, Person Finder, that makes it possible for information about missing persons to be posted online and searched, with the option of triggering alerts.

The role of crisis mapping was to bridge the gap that existed between information-seekers and providers, particularly when it came to providing insights into the situation on the ground and the action that needed to be taken, Mr. Purohit said in an e-mail interview to The Hindu .

Haiti earthquake

The world got a glimpse of the potential of crowdsourced mapping following the deployment of an open-source platform called Ushahidi when an earthquake hit Haiti in 2010. The information provided by the affected population and others over the Internet and the mobile phone network and the map-based capabilities of the platform helped in addressing specific disaster management requirements.

In the case of the Haiti earthquake, a volunteer team got the platform going fast and were soon tapping into social media sources like Twitter, facebook, and blogs and other media to create actionable reports. Later an international SMS number was created for people to input information relating to the quake. Soon it turned into a flood which was painstakingly processed by volunteers and turned into information that could be loaded onto an online map.

As many as 4,636 project volunteers translated 25,186 SMSs and numerous e-mails, web, and social media communications, resulting in 3,596 reports that were actionable and included enough relevant information to be mapped on Ushahidi, said a United States Institute of Peace report.

Now the trend was to try to use automation to process such large volumes of information.

“Until recently, much of our crisis response and disaster coordination relied on manual effort using web infrastructure. Ushahidi is an excellent and successful example. More recently, there is rapid progress on our ability to use automation — especially in processing large amount of information shared on social media,” said Amit P. Sheth, director, Kno.e.sis Center. “We are at a stage where we should combine human effort with machine processing,” he said.",solution,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 28, 2013",Uttarakhand,200 mm,USD 3 billion,"5,700","Destruction of infrastructure, loss of livelihoods, displacement of people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The torrential rain that lashed the district in the past two days has caused extensive damage to property left many areas flooded.

All rivers and canals in the district are overflowing. Several areas are under water. Most of the houses were damaged when uprooted trees fell over them. The district administration has opened 14 more relief camps to rehabilitate people from flood-hit areas.

Houses and resorts at Athirappilly and Pillappara areas suffered heavy damage in the gush of water from the forest areas. The Kappathode, flowing between Kodassery and Pariyaram panchayats, poses threat of floods in the area. The paddy fields at the Koratty, Metur, Vellanchira areas are also under water.

The overflowing Chalakudy river has created panic among people residing on its banks. Houses were damaged in Chittattukara and Kakkassery. Many houses in Varantharappilly area were marooned in the flood water. The Kurumaly river is overflowing in many areas. A block in the Attappilly Regulator-cum-Bridge created floods at Palappilly, Kannattumpadam, Varantharappilly, Attappilly, Muplium, Vellarampadam and Nanthipulam areas. The fast floods in Karikadavu river caused damage in the neighbouring areas. The tribal settlement in the area is under water. The bridge across the Chokkana river was washed away.

What is the meaning and origin of ‘fall off the wagon’?

(J. Badrinath, Shimoga)

When you ‘fall off the wagon’, you go back to drinking alcohol in large quantities after having abstained from it for a while.

Nowadays, the expression is used to refer to the resumption of any bad activity — drugs, smoking, overeating, etc.

*When John lost his job, he fell off the wagon and gorged himself on ice cream.

The ‘wagon’ in this American expression refers to the water wagons used to sprinkle water on the streets to keep the dust down. During the times of Prohibition in the 19th century, men often climbed onto these wagons and took an oath they would give up alcohol and drink only water. This gave rise to the expression ‘to be on the water cart/wagon’; it was later shortened to ‘on the wagon’.

When these individuals broke their pledge and started hitting the bottle again, they were said to have ‘fallen off the wagon’.

How is the word ‘lambaste’ pronounced?

(RV Shalani, Kurnool)

The word can be spelt ‘lambast’ as well. The first syllable rhymes with ‘ham’, ‘dam’ and ‘Sam’, while the second rhymes with ‘paste’, ‘haste’ and ‘taste’.

The word is pronounced ‘lam-BASTE’ with the stress on the second syllable. It is also possible to pronounce the ‘a’ in the second syllable like the ‘a’ in ‘act’, ‘pact’ and ‘fact’. The original meaning of this word was to assault someone rather violently — in other words, to beat or thrash someone.

Nowadays, the verb is mostly used to refer to a thrashing of the verbal kind.

When you lambaste someone, you give him a tongue-lashing; you criticise or scold the individual/thing quite severely.

*Yadav’s first novel was lambasted by all critics.

Some of my friends can’t take their eyes off the TV whenever there is an IPL match going on. Is there a term for this?

(M Bhasker, Chennai)

When they watch their favourite programme on TV, some people manage to tune out the world. They are unaware of what is happening around them, and if you disturb them, they become angry. Such people are said to be ‘TV stoned’. Like a drug user, they are experiencing the effects of a drug — in this case, TV.

*Hema can’t talk to you right now. She is TV stoned.

The Chennai TamBrahm milieu in RS Prasanna’s Kalyana Samayal Sadham is presented with a loving insider-knowingness that’s not been seen on screen since... maybe, Aaha . The usual jokes about girls being tutored in Carnatic music and Bharatanatyam (and boys in playing the mridangam) acquire a fresh sheen because we’re not laughing at them but with them. These characters aren’t the besh-besh stereotypes we’re often saddled with. They’re people who’ve moved on with the times — and yet, they stoop slightly under the weight of tradition.

When Raghu (Prasanna) comes to see a prospective bride — Meera (Lekha Washington) — he suggests that they go out for a cup of coffee and talk. Her father squirms. He knows it would be terribly old-fashioned of him to refuse, and he reaches a compromise by asking a couple of kids in the household to “show Raghu the way to the coffee shop.” (Raghu knows, very well, where it is.)

The film depicts the dilemma of being young today and having to uphold the expectations that come from belonging to a very old culture. On the one hand, it’s the world of Facebook and priests who conduct rituals over Skype, and on the other, there are still cheques to be presented to marriage halls for big, fat (and very stressful) Indian weddings that neither bride nor groom are particularly invested in. They’re in this only because their parents want it.

And then they find themselves in a fix. There’s a problem in the plumbing department — and since this is a family publication, suffice it to say that a PowerPoint presentation at an office, the next day, shows drooping line graphs. How do you portray a dramatic (and icky) issue in a light-hearted manner? Vicky Donor walked that tightrope exquisitely. Kalyana Samayal Sadham sets its sights lower. It wants to be little more than an innocuous, pleasant, crowd-pleasing entertainer, so you can’t fault it for what it isn’t — but there’s a lingering sense of what-could-have-been.

I couldn’t buy the contrivance of Meera’s father being completely unperturbed by this problem. And I wished the splendid supporting cast (‘Crazy’ Mohan, Neelu, Delhi Ganesh, ‘Kathadi’ Ramamoorthy) had been given more to do. But more crucially, there’s never a sense of anything really being at stake.

The director is right in wanting to avoid melodrama, but he veers too far in the other direction. Practically everyone is cordial, good-natured. It’s a refreshing change that Raghu and Meera aren’t opposites who snarl at each other, first, and then fall in love, but their extreme amiability presents a different kind of problem. There is no bite in their big fight, which is so low-key that it hardly registers — though it’s followed by a lovely (and equally low-key) conversation between Raghu and his friend (Raghav, playing the rare NRI who’s not a cliché).

The most remarkable aspect of this spat, however, is that it pivots on the word “wuss.” There is no attempt to translate it for the general audiences, ranging from ages six through sixty, and from the toniest A-centre viewer to the sweat-soaked farmer in a C-centre hamlet. This attitude — if you get it you get it; if you don’t you don’t — is a bracing sign for cinema from young filmmakers, and it’s possible when you keep your budgets low.

Better still, the entire falling-in-love track — charted through the beautiful song ‘Mella sirithaai’ — is outlined through Facebook messages in Tanglish. Too often, in the name of compromise, we end up with cinema that tries to please everybody and ends up satisfying nobody. For all its niggling problems, Kalyana Samayal Sadham doesn’t make that mistake.

And the leads keep us watching. Lekha Washington doesn’t have much to do, but she glides through the proceedings effortlessly, and the character of Meera strikes a major blow for the Tamil-film heroine by asking for a glass of wine and, at a later point, admitting that sex is important to her. This is an unapologetic representation of an upper-class urban woman.

As for Prasanna, you want to build a small shrine for him simply for agreeing to play this part in a cultural climate where heroism is synonymous with machismo. He’s wonderful in the scene where he sees that Meera has finally accepted his Facebook-friend request. He’s earned it, and he doesn’t pump a fist in the air and go crazy — there’s just a small smile. This is a subtler breed of hero, who doesn’t need to advertise his emotions in neon lights, and whose masculinity is defined not by his prowess in the sack but by the fact that he lets his woman be who she is, who she wants to be. We’re not likely to see the likes of Raghu or Meera in a hurry, so I forgave them their overblown, la-la-land fantasy moment at the end. They deserve it.

Sachin is a simple person. He gets along with all the other players, be it a debutant or a senior player. He has no airs and is also quite easy to approach. He has a calm approach toward every game and handles pressure very well. Any player can seek batting tips from the maestro. He would observe your skill level and then offer help. Even though he is considered the god of Indian Cricket, he is like any normal person.

His place is irreplaceable. His slot may be filled but the vacuum caused by his exit cannot be. He is similar to Sir Don Bradman, the likes of which are born only once in a generation. No one has evolved before and can evolve after Sachin. In my opinion, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are coming up well and are very likely to shoulder the responsibility that the Little Master has done in these 24 years.

Learning from the Master

Mere talent cannot take you to the highest level. It should be complemented with hard work, dedication and discipline. Sachin is a perfect example of this combination. He used to have really long batting stints at the nets during practice sessions. He always used to be the first person, who entered the nets, and the last person, who left it. Even after he practised his batting at the nets, he used to play extra by bowling and get his rhythm going. Humility is one of his best characteristics. He also has a great passion for the game that has taken him to such heights. The current generation needs to understand and work on it.

A drinking water supply project, conceived nearly 50 years ago for water-starved and fluoride-hit people of Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts in north-western belt, is to become a reality on Wednesday when Chief Minister Jayalalithaa formally commissions through video-conferencing.

The project, now called Hogenakkal Water Supply and Fluorosis Mitigation Project, was originally mooted when K. Kamaraj was Chief Minister in the 1960s. Over the years, it witnessed various changes and eventually, when the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam was in power, the project took off.

The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) decided to fund the 80 per cent of the project cost, which is around Rs. 1,928 crore. A senior official of the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board, the executing agency, says that in terms of cost, this is the biggest taken up by the Board.

But, the significance of the project is not just about the cost. It is going to serve people in a region, which is among less developed in many respects.

As per an estimate of the funding agency, the districts of Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri had, as of 2006, about 1.1 million people living below poverty line.

According to 12th Five Year Plan document of the State Planning Commission, human development indices of the Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts are 0.748 and 0.707 against the State’s overall figure of 0.765.

Known for chronic water shortage, the two districts receive less rainfall compared to many other parts of the State. Their average annual rainfall is 815 mm whereas the State’s annual rainfall is 977 mm. But, what affects them more is the presence of fluoride, harmful to the human body, in the groundwater. People suffer from dental and skeletal fluorosis, says a note prepared by the funding agency.

A document of the Municipal Administration and Water Supply Department [under whose administrative control comes the TWAD Board] states that among 3.8 lakh school students assessed for dental fluorosis, the intensity of the problem was severe in respect of three per cent of the students while it was moderate in the case of 10 per cent.

Taking into account all these aspects, the authorities have designed the project, which will benefit about 3.3 million spread over three municipalities, 17 town panchayats and 6,755 rural habitations in the two districts.

Using Cauvery as the source, the project can take care of the requirements of four million. On completion of the project, all rural habitations will have the prescribed norm of 40 litres per capita per day (LPCD) and the urban local bodies, 135 LPCD, adds the official.

Classic case of cost overrun

The Hogenakkal water supply project presents a classic case of cost overrun.

When it was sought to be revived nearly 25 years after the project was mooted in the 1960s, the project was estimated to cost around Rs. 110 crore.

In 1986, when M.G. Ramachandran was Chief Minister, he had come up with a scheme to benefit people of three others districts too — Tiruvannamalai, Vellore and Cuddalore — along with Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri. [Now, the project covers only Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri].

As a mark of remembering Kamaraj who had originally mooted the scheme, MGR had even named it as “Kamaraj Plan Project,” Ms Jayalalithaa said five years ago when she, as Leader of Opposition, led a walkout of her party members from the Assembly over a controversy involving the Hogenakkal project.

After Ms Jayalalithaa became Chief Minister for the first time in 1991, the project was sought to be given a fresh lease of life again and in 1994, the project cost was revised as Rs. 450 crore.

When the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam came to power in 1996, the cost went up to Rs. 600 crore. Even at that time, Japanese assistance was sought. When it looked like the approval of the Japan government was only a matter of formality, the 1998 Pokhran nuclear blasts took place. Consequently, economic sanctions were imposed on India. Years later, the project was revived once again and in August 2005 when the AIADMK was in power, the cost rose to Rs. 1,005 crore, and remained the same when the project was posed to the Japanese authorities in 2006.

In four years, the cost almost doubled, owing to one reason or the other. In 2010, it went up to Rs.1,928.8 crore from Rs.1,334 crore.",solution,Hogenakkal Water Supply and Fluorosis Mitigation Project,Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts in north-western belt of Tamil Nadu,1960s,2013,"3.3 million people spread over three municipalities, 17 town panchayats and 6,755 rural habitations in the two districts",815 mm,,,"The project will benefit about 3.3 million spread over three municipalities, 17 town panchayats and 6,755 rural habitations in the two districts.

Dehradun/Haridwar: Surrounded by dense green forest, with a waterfall nearby, the tiny village of Rambara was the most popular resting place for devotees trekking to Kedarnath from Gaurikund. But the flash floods that caused death and destruction at Kedarnath on June 16-17 spared none in Rambara. Nothing is left there, just nothing.

The entire area, which housed around 100-150 shops and five hotels, to serve the needs of the ever swelling number of pilgrims, was completely washed away leaving no trace of the once bustling hamlet perched at an altitude of 2591 metres halfway on the 14 km long trek to Kedarnath.

The floods have left Rambara under 10 feet of sludge. No one can risk a guess on the number of people washed away by the angry Mandakini river or worse still, lie buried under the heaps of mud and debris.

As per eyewitnesses, on June 16 at around 6.15 pm, water level in the Mandakini rose like a tsunami; huge waves of engulfed Rambara, sweeping away everything.

When the trail of death from Kedarnath reached Rambara after decimating upstream hamlets like Gadoriya and Gidurpharni, most of those present there were caught unaware. While the locals dashed up the surrounding hills, it was sometime before the pilgrims understood the killer force of the unfolding tragedy.

A few lucky ones escaped but most others were caught in the swirling waters and are yet to be traced. Many saw their near and dear ones being swept away but couldn’t help them. Torn between the option of saving their own life or risking it for others, the choice was tough.

One young man had no such confusion when his teenage daughter slipped from his tight grip and fell into a deep ditch by the gushing river. In a flash, he handed over the custody of his son to his relatives and against everybody’s advice, jumped into certain death – he wanted to do all he could to save his daughter.

Despite the fall having injured him, he searched for his daughter for over two hours before locating her lying unconscious near the river bank. He then carried her on his back all the way down the mountain to safety.

Others who escaped into the mountains surrounding Rambara had a harrowing time. While some lost the battle against hunger and cold, most wandered for days before they reached nearby villages or were evacuated by Indian Air Force choppers from Jungle Chatti - located between Gaurikund and Rambara.

While the government has promised to reconstruct Rambara along with Kedarnath and Gaurikund, the extremely sensitive location of Rambara may very well mean that it will not be rebuilt to its original state.

Avoidable tragedy

Noted environmentalist and Magsaysay awardee Chandi Prasad Bhatt has accused the Uttarakhand government of sleeping over a report of National Remote Sensing Agency and said had the government taken the report seriously, ""destruction in and around Kedarnath shrine would have been much less horrific"".

""The report identifies the areas around Kedarnath including Rambara, Gaurikund, Ghindurpani, and Garuriya, which have been the worst hit in the recent tragedy, as highly prone to landslides and natural calamities,"" he said.

The report, termed as `Hazard Zonation Mapping`, was prepared by around 100 distinguished scientists from country`s leading research institutes at the initiative of the Indian government and was submitted to the state government in 2001.

The expert panel had recommended a host of measures for the calamity sensitive area of the state and neighbouring Himachal Pradesh including planned mining, bio-technical measures for channelisation of water in the catchment areas of rivers near Kedarnath, afforestation of Rambada and Jungle Chatti areas, soil conservation and slope modification measures in Gaurikund besides construction of retention walls in Hanuman Chatti which have all been severely damaged in the deluge.

""Had even five per cent of the recommendations of the panel been implemented, the scale of destruction in and around the Himalayan shrine would have been much less horrific,"" he said.

The national highway between Dehradun and Srinagar is currently broken at Byasi and Devprayag, with silt measuring upto 10 ft. covering an enormous area, in Uttarakhand’s Pauri district.

According to the residents of Shakti Vihar, an area in Srinagar, this disaster occurred on June 17 at around 3.00 a.m. when the Srinagar dam authorities lifted the dam gates.

Ajay Uniyal, a resident, said, “The rainfall on June 16 was so much that the water reached up to our knees, and to add to it, the dam authorities released water without a prior warning.”

Mr. Uniyal said the silt was from the debris lying around the dam construction site. “The water swept all the debris lying around the dam construction site and deposited it here.”

Ritu Raj Singh, another resident, said, “Such an incident happened at Bhaktiyana in 1971 as well, but that year only water filled the area and everything became fine once the water level receded.”

According to the residents, the water level this time was three to four metres higher than the previous floods.

Aradhana Negi, a resident of Bhaktiyana, said, “People, whose houses have been destroyed, are taking shelter in some houses uphill and in some government guest houses while their belongings [whatever remain)]are lying on the terrace of their respective silt-filled houses.”

Pradeep Mal, another resident of the area, said, “Though residents were saved, cattle were killed under the silt.”

“Quintals of fish that was the river brought along are also rotting under the debris,” said Mr. Mal.

Every person passing by the site could smell the rotten flesh. “This can cause disease but the authorities have not yet bothered to take any action,” said Ms. Negi.

A Services Selection Board (SSB) Academy, a gas godown, a ration godown, a silk farm, hundreds of houses, vehicles, and animals were affected by the massive flashfloods that hit Srinagar.

Ms. Negi said, “Every year the river water enters the houses that are near it. People complain, but the authorities do not bother to take action. Then monsoons end and people too become silent on the issue.”

The identity of the person whose head was found severed in Vyasarpadi on Tuesday night has been discovered. S. Praveen Kumar, a nineteen-year-old ITI student, was killed by his friends, one of whom was in love with the same girl as him.

Police said Praveen, who was also known as Tison, was a resident of Eighth Main Road in MKB Nagar and was in love with a girl from his neighbourhood. His friend R. Vinod Kumar (20) too was interested in the same girl and the friends often used to get into arguments over this.

A few days ago, Praveen threatened Vinod over the issue. Subsequently, Vinod and two others, P. Kalaiarasan (20), a resident of Debar Nagar, and S. Ajith (21) decided to murder Praveen.

On Tuesday night, around 9.30 p.m., the trio went to Praveen’s house and took him to the railway cargo yard in Vyasarpadi on the pretext of arriving at a compromise over alcohol. At the yard, a fight broke out between Praveen and Vinod and the former threatened to kill Vinod if he continued to disturb the girl. When Praveen fell down after consuming a huge quantity of alcohol, Vinod and his friends beheaded Praveen. They left the body at the yard while disposing off the head on Satyamurthy Nagar Main Road.

The police got a tip-off regarding the recovery of a human head in that area and a special team was formed, said assistant commissioner of police, Govi Manohar. Lead by additional deputy commissioner of police (Pulianthope), S Jayakumar, the team inspected the spot where the Praveen’s head was found and also found the body from the railway yard. An identity card of Kalaiarasan was recovered from the crime scene at railway yard and with it, the police narrowed down the accused. All three suspects including Vinod surrendered at a lower court in Saidapet on Wednesday afternoon and later, were sent to Puzhal prison.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

November 27, 1890, saw London all agog. The final hearing of a sensational high-society divorce case, of the Governor of Madras, was taking place. The petitioner, Lady Connemara, daughter of Lord Dalhousie, once the Governor-General of India, was there in person. The respondent, Lord Connemara, was neither present nor represented.

In 1886, Robert Bourke, a successful career politician, was made Lord Connemara and posted to Madras as Governor. In the Governor’s household were his niece, Lady Eva Quinn, and her husband who was Aide-de-Camp to the Governor. Lady Connemara suffered from the Madras heat and Lady Quinn began acting as hostess at all social events, which the former deeply resented.

Quarrels ensued especially when the gubernatorial party retreated to Ootacamund and Capt. Quinn resigned his post and returned to England, leaving his wife to follow. Lord Connemara returned to Madras in October 1888 with his niece, leaving his wife in the hills. The Governor’s doctor, Surgeon-Major Briggs, stayed on to attend to Lady Connemara.

Once in Madras, Lady Quinn stayed at Government House and acted as hostess to a large house party complete with several aristocrats from England. Lady Connemara arrived suddenly with Dr. Briggs on the eve of a ball, and was mortified at what she saw. She left at once to stay at a hotel. Incredibly enough, barring a few of the inner circle, none knew of Lady Connemara residing at the hotel for four long months. She refused to return to Government House even after Lady Eva was sent home. In March 1889, Lady Connemara sailed to England.

In November 1889, Hannah Moore, one of Lady Connemara’s former maids confessed to adultery with Lord Connemara while at Government House, Madras. Lady Connemara immediately filed for divorce citing infidelity. Lord Connemara countered by accusing his wife of having an affair with Dr. Briggs, which she hotly denied. The Governor resigned his post and returned to England but chose to stay away from the divorce proceedings. His political career was finished.

Dr. Briggs testified in Court that Hannah had confessed to him about the adultery. Lord Connemara being absent, the divorce was granted at once. Shortly thereafter, Lady Connemara married Dr. Briggs. Hannah Moore went on to a good position with another aristocratic family. Lord Connemara married a rich widow. In short, everyone lived happily ever after.

Several years later, a newspaper speculated on whether Lady Connemara had connived with the servant girl to stage a drama of adultery to enable a quick divorce. It cited a character reference that Lady Connemara gave Hannah in which she had praised the latter’s faith and trustworthiness.

Government House, where all this happened, has since made way for the new assembly-cum-secretariat, now the multi-specialty hospital.

As for the hotel where Lady Connemara resided, it changed its name to Connemara and remains so. A portrait of Lord Connemara is in the lobby. A picture of his first lady would have been more appropriate.",discussion,1890 Madras Flood,Madras,"November 27, 1890",December 1890,Madras,unknown,unknown,unknown,divorce of Lord Connemara,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Over two months after Kedarnath shrine was ravaged by devastating floods in Uttarakhand, efforts are on in full swing to ensure that prayers resume by September 11 as planned even as priests say that much will depend on weather conditions.

“Preparations are going on. There is a meeting on August 25 in Dehradun to take a final call on whether the prayers can begin on the proposed date as we have to consider the weather conditions also. Everyone wants that prayers begin as early as possible,” Rawal Bhimshankar Ling, the chief priest of Kedarnath told PTI from Devangere, Karnataka.

Uttarakhand chief minister Vijay Bahuguna had announced earlier this month that prayers will resume from September 11.

A 40-member team consisting of PWD and revenue department personnel reached Kedarnath this week to expedite debris removal exercise and complete other arrangements even as most places across the state were lashed by light to moderate rains.

“Prayers will be held with all the rituals. We will perform a purification prayer first which will include havan.

After that the traditional prayer will begin under the guidance of priests,” said the priest who is in Kanavkuppi math in Devangere, Karnataka for ‘shravan rudrabhishek’ which is dedicated to those who died in Kedarnath tragedy this year.

“Many people want to see the prayers but we have to keep the weather conditions and arrangements in mind. Once the prayers get resumed Bagesh Ling, the present priest of Kedarnath temple and other staff will remain there till the doors get closed on November 5,” he said.

Bagesh Ling, who was inside the temple on the fateful day, is in Ukhimath now and waiting for prayer to get resumed.

“We are collecting all the necessary stuff for purification and traditional puja,” Bagesh said.

“Prayers will be offered to Kaal Bhairav first. Then we will offer Balbhog to Kedarnath, after that there will be Abhishek and Shringar of God and we will offer Mahabhog. There will be a Sampoorna arti in the evening. This is the tradition and will be followed till the doors are closed for winter,” he said.

He also said that all the idols brought to Ukhimath after the floods will be taken back to Kedarnath.

“We had brought the movable idols of Ganesh, Parvati, Shankar, Kaal Bhairav and Shaligram to Ukhimath but now we will take them back to Kedarnath. After offering bhog to them, the prayers can resume,” he said.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

For three days running, there was no reaction from the Bharatiya Janata Party to reports that the Gujarat Chief Minister, Narendra Modi, had evacuated ‘15,000 Gujaratis’ from Uttarakhand in the course of a two-day visit to the hill State. But with doubts growing over how such a feat was achieved, if it was achievable at all, the party finally broke its silence on Wednesday. BJP president Rajnath Singh said he had spoken to Mr. Modi who denied making any such claim. Mr. Singh also wondered at the source for the figure of 15,000. “Where did this come from”? he asked.

The journalist who first wrote the story with the ‘15,000 Gujarati pilgrims’ claim has come out with the answer. He said the figure emerged from Mr. Singh’s party, the BJP, itself. Anand Soondas — chief of the National News Features of Times of India (TOI), and Editor, Sunday Times — told The Hindu that his source for the figure was Anil Baluni, the BJP’s spokesperson in Haldwani in Uttarakhand.

Mr. Soondas said the conversation between him and Mr. Baluni had taken place in “the presence of Uttarakhand BJP president, Tirath Singh Rawat, a bunch of youth leaders from Gujarat and a couple of bureaucrats from Gujarat.” Mr. Soondas said he had asked them if they were sure if all those taken back were Gujaratis, and the answer was in the affirmative. Mr. Baluni is quoted in the story as saying, “It’s amazing what he (Modi) has done here.”

The Hindu called Mr. Baluni to confirm if he had indeed given the story to Mr. Soondas but he first asked to be called later and then switched off the phone. He was unreachable till late in the evening.

Headlined, “Narendra Modi lands in Uttarakhand, flies out with 15,000 Gujaratis’, Mr Soondas’s story had appeared in The Times of India on June 23. The story made many claims in addition to the rescue of 15,000 pilgrims. Among them: requisitioning of four Boeings and 80 Toyota Innovas by Mr. Modi towards passage of the rescued pilgrims; air-dropping of a complete medical team on Hardwar; and setting up of camps across the flood-hit areas.

The Gujarat Chief Minister’s supporters greeted the news in jubilation, citing it as proof of his super-managerial skills, and saying that the performance of the Centre, the Uttarakhand Government, and even the Armed Forces, had paled in comparison. BJP office-bearers hailed Mr. Modi’s effort as a model to be emulated by the Centre and other States.

But soon, criticism started on two grounds. The first punctured the ‘15,000’ figure, with several reports showing how it was logistically impossible to conduct such an ‘evacuation’ operation in the limited time span and in the prevailing weather conditions. Others pointed out that even if true, the act of only rescuing Gujaratis, did not enhance the image of a prime ministerial aspirant. It was after this that Rajnath Singh stepped in and questioned the veracity of the story.

Mr. Soondas was unfazed by criticism that he had not exercised due diligence in presenting the 15,000 figure as fact. He said: “I believe rescuing 15,000 people over four days is actually possible since it refers to providing them food, transport, logistics.” He defended the pitch of the story, and argued: “It is not possible to say everything in the introduction. The headline seems to have brought a sharper focus to the story.”

In the past few days, a spate of new stories and blogs — sourced to Gujarat government officials — have made fresh claims about Mr. Modi’s rescue efforts in Uttarakhand and praised him for showing the way forward in disaster management.

Had the elemental fury of flash floods not rained down on Uttarakhand last week, June 18 (June 19, according to some almanacs), would have been a day of festivity and ritual for Hindu devotes across north India. They would have relived the mythology of the Ganga’s descent from heaven to earth with a dip in its waters at various pilgrimage centres.

Ganga Dussehra – celebrated on the tenth day of the waxing moon in the third month of the Hindu almanac – usually coincides with the opening up of ice-bound holy sites such as Kedarnath, Badrinath, and Gangotri.

This time, however, the sweeping devastation along the banks of the Ganga in Uttarakhand, with Kedarnath feeling its full force, swiftly transformed the mood from celebration to mourning.

In the midst of so much grief, how do we reflect on the mythology of Ganga’s descent in a way that it enables us to comprehend a tragedy of this magnitude, and perhaps relearn a relationship between human and nature that is life-affirming. For that to happen, it is necessary to look beyond the veil of ritual surrounding this myth. At its core, this mythology is made up of aspects which have been integral to people’s ways of life in mountains, lived in full awareness of the towering presence of nature.

Two narratives

The myth of Ganga’s descent contains two very different narratives. The first part is a narrative of power. At its simplest, the story of Ganga’s descent starts on a note of hubris, with a proud king called Sagara whose ambition is to conquer the world. As it becomes clear that there are few to rival Sagara, the gods above intervene. Sagara’s 60,000 arrogant sons (all born of one of his wives) are reduced to ash by the wrath of sage Kapila for having disrupted his meditation. King Sagara dies of grief. For his sons, now mere heaps of impure ash, there is no salvation for generations on end.

Then, Bhagiratha (descended from the son of Sagara’s second wife) ascends the throne, and from here the narrative of the myth changes track. Deeply stirred by the fate of his ancestors, he leaves his throne to undergo two long and increasingly severe penances in the Himalayas. The gods are pleased. Thus Ganga descends from heaven to be caught in the locks of Shiva, who alone can withstand her tempestuous force.

Bhagiratha performs his third penance, whereupon Shiva releases Ganga in several streams. Ganga follows Bhagiratha across mountains, forests and plains to the end of the world where his ancestors’ remains lie. Midway, the wilful Ganga scatters sage Jahnu’s sacrificial offerings and he swallows her up in rage. Bhagiratha performs one more penance to have her released yet again, showing enormous reserves of persistence.

Finally, Bhagiratha leads her to his ancestors’ ashes at Ganga Sagar. Having purified their ashes and paved their way to heaven, Ganga disappears into the ocean.

Origins of a name

That’s how the originating head stream of the Ganga gets its name Bhagirathi, say people, the other major headstream of the Ganga being the Alaknanda. These two headstreams, nourished by several others (such as the Mandakini, flowing alongside Kedarnath) come together as the Ganga, which flows across the plains until it reaches the Bay of Bengal.

The myth of Ganga’s descent resonates at different levels in the lives of the people of Uttarakhand. At one level, the story of Ganga getting tangled in Shiva’s locks or inexplicably disappearing seems entirely believable in a geological landscape that has seen rivers changing course, or getting blocked — swallowed by tectonic disturbances.

In a wonderfully layered article written in 1994, well-known writer, poet and cultural theorist Pria Devi pointed out an interesting ecological aspect of Ganga Dussehra: “It falls at the leanest moment in the annual cycle of the river, at the precise moment when, before the rains, she begins to swell with snowmelt at her source.” It is as if the Ganga comes down from the heavens every year.

At another level, this story provides the alluvium of cultural resources for a society to shape its ecology of existence. That is, if one stays connected to its core. Thus, in a land where nature resists all attempts at ‘domination’ or ‘subjugation’, it is Bhagiratha, not Sagara with his goal of world conquest, who emerges as a heroic figure, articulating a different narrative of power. The qualities emblematic of this valorous figure: his ‘powers’ of persistence, humility, and selflessness.

Pria Devi puts it succinctly: “What distinguishes Bhagiratha and explains his great popularity as a culture hero, is his non-violence, and his remarkable patience. He is quite clear about means and ends. His ends are selfless. It is not his own moksha that he seeks. Equally, he will not seek his ends by applying his will outwardly as a force.

He turns inwards....By the integrity of his self-government he compels outward sanction to his inner motives.” This strand of cultural memory can be a potent resource for resistance, for it implies that notions of conquest – of humans or nature – be replaced by the idea of conquest of the self and its excess appetites, whether it is an individual, or society.

Cultural memory

Like a river this cultural memory flows through space and time — now a subterranean existence, now a rapid current over ground. And when it does surface, it lays bare civilisational faultlines such as an exclusionary narrative of power impervious to the political ecology of inclusive instincts. In post-independence India, this cultural memory surfaced in the 1970s to herald a new phase of protest — environmental resistance — that one might term a ‘Bhagiratha prayas’ (the Hindi equivalent for Herculean effort). This phase was accompanied by the articulation of a whole new discourse of Constitutional guarantees such as equality and citizenship emerging from the margins of the Republic, from the Narmada valley to present-day Niyamgiri hills.

In Uttarakhand, too, the past four decades have seen noteworthy movements of environmental resistance built on this principle, such as the 1970s Chipko movement spearheaded by village women like Gaura Devi, which is considered India’s first green movement. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Gandhian activist and environmentalist Sunderlal Bahuguna through long fasts, and many others such as Professor Vinod K. Gaur and other experts of Himalayan geology, questioned the long term impact of big dams such as Tehri (built on the Bhagirathi), on the fragile ecological balance of the Uttarakhand region. As for the Ganga, listed among the 10 most endangered rivers of the world by the Worldwide Fund for Nature, it still awaits the collective conscience of a Bhagiratha to come back to life.

Role of greed

The qualities symbolised by Bhagiratha also exist as part of larger contemporary discourses, when we speak of sustainable development, disparities within nations and between hemispheres, or limiting consumption by putting a leash on gluttony.

The story of Bhagiratha and Ganga is as relevant today, if not more. As news filters in of the near totality of nature’s devastation in Uttarakhand, it is becoming clear that humans have played their part in exacerbating the sheer scale of the disaster in terms of lives lost and property destroyed. Unchecked construction and increasing encroachment on the flood plains of the Ganga to accommodate more and more residential buildings, hotels and tourist rest houses in the name of development, have extracted a huge human cost for a Sagara-like conquest of the environment.

Similarly, in the aftermath of the 1991 Uttarkashi earthquake, experts had pointed to the man-made factors responsible for large-scale destruction: the explosion of inappropriate building techniques and materials in the march to ‘modern progress’ frequently accompanied with a disdainful neglect of local wisdom. Over the years the nature of protest may have changed, but the issues of entrenched interests vis-a-vis forest, mineral and water resources still remain; on the contrary, they have become more acute.

Due to a range of factors, the catastrophe which brought forth a terrifying side to the Ganga not witnessed in recent times, occurred around the time of Ganga Dussehra.

Yet seen in conjunction, the disaster and the mythology seem to be pointing to the same truth: ritual observance on an appointed day may be important, but is certainly not enough. It is equally significant to internalise the essential spirit and reality of the story of Bhagiratha and Ganga, and, for that, the pact between the self-reflexive human and nature needs to be revived.

Is Bhubaneswar’s rapid expansion in all directions making the city prone to flood? The scene of under-construct high rises and new residential colonies amidst sea of water on the outskirts of city gives an indication of the trend.

Raghunathpur, which was earlier known as an outskirts locality and now a part of city, on Friday witnessed swirling water entering residential colonies and flooding premises of under construct 14-storeyed building, besides vast stretch getting inundated.

Flooding of entire Raghunathpur area rang alarm bells among new settlers. In near future, the frequency of colonies getting flooded within hours of shower will only increase further. Floodwater almost touched backward of Big Bazar Square at Patia.

On the other side of railway track, villages such as Kalajhari and Ostapada have been submerged. People were seen fleeing to safer places.

“Such a vast area getting flooded around Raghunathpur is something new to us. During past couple of years, Raghunathpur is part of Bhubaneswar and high income group people have started to settle down here,” said Patitapaban Mishra, who built a house near Raghunathpur.

Mr. Mishra pointed out even the multi-thousand crore apartment projects which were under construction were not spared by the floodwater this time.

If people in northern side of Bhubaneswar are clueless about rainwater entering their houses, southern-eastern Bhubaneswar (Sundarpada area) had already experienced the plight of inundation a few years ago. The misery of houses getting submerged in eastern part of city has multiplied this year.

Why is Bhubaneswar fast getting into the situation akin to that of Mumbai? Rapid unplanned growth around the capital city is the sole reason behind the disaster. Vast agricultural fields used to constitute outer channel of Kanjia Lake of Nandankanan. However, as real estate developers and new settlers have started to convert agricultural land into residential colonies, the natural channels for water discharge are blocked now. Result is evident. Two hours of heavy rain would throw life haywire.

This week’s torrential rain also submerged national highway near Acharya Vihar for the first time. Traffic had to be diverted and vehicles remained stranded on road for hours due to water-logging. Experts blame it to construction of flyovers and development roads without paying much emphasis on water discharge mechanism.

The new by-pass road on eastern side of GGP Colony, Bomikhal and Laxmisagar area too proved to be a bane for people who have been struggling to cope with water inundation during rainy season. The new road had also blocked natural discharge of water from capital city. “Planners have not learnt lessons from the disasters in cities like Mumbai, Kolkata and New Delhi. When they conceive new infrastructure projects like roads, first priority should be given to water discharge system. Apart from human miseries, water-logging in urban areas had also an impact on economy,” said Piyush Ranjan Rout, an urban management practitioner. Despite several attempts authorities neither from Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation nor from Bhubaneswar Development Authority were prepared to talk on the unplanned growth of the city.",issue,Bhubaneswar Floods,"Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India","October 26, 2013","October 27, 2013","['Raghunathpur', 'Kalajhari', 'Ostapada', 'Sundarpada']",['200 mm'],"['Residential colonies and under-construct high rises flooded', 'National highway submerged', 'Traffic diverted', 'Vehicles stranded on road for hours']",0,"['People fleeing to safer places', 'Life thrown haywire']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

So much secrecy! The Park Hyatt’s newest restaurant has been cloaked in a clever web of rumours, conjecture and promises. Raising expectations sky high is not always the best thing for a gutsy experiment. Nevertheless, anticipation is always fun. So when we finally enter the Flying Elephant, it’s a bit of an Ali Baba moment: doors swing open. We walk into a flood of warm golden light. And are immediately enveloped by a sense of languorous luxury.

Of course, there’s a story. The folks at Park Hyatt are big on these. After all, the hotel has been built on a tale of a rich textile merchant who returns to India to settle down in his dream home. As the back story goes, the owner’s son, rebel with a cause and actor on the New York stage. When he returns, the prodigal son is given a home of his own: The Flying Elephant.

General Manager Yann Gillet walks us in, amid a chorus of hellos from brightly dressed staff. Theatrical, unconventional and dynamic, the restaurant stretches vertically, over seven levels. About 50 metres high, and blanketed in glass, it’s a total of 9000 sq ft. The idea is to “celebrate the performance of food,” says Amit Mahtaney, who conceptualised the restaurant, created by New York-based George Wong Designs. Amit is the son of Vijay Mahtaney, Managing Director of Ambattur Clothing, which owns the Chennai Park Hyatt. And surprise, surprise. He has a drama degree from New York.

You can tell Amit’s heart is in theatre, as he calls for Bollinger champagne, and coaches the waiter on how to throw his voice for maximum impact. We settle down in the library bar, cosy with books and plush sofas. There are plates of juicy satay, served with a chunky peanut sauce, airy vodka battered fish and tart plump olives.

As we raise our glasses of bubbly, Amit tells us about how they came up with the name. “So, all of us were having a drink late at night…” (Non-stop revelry seems to be the theme here.) Anyway, after one too many carrotinis (unabashedly orange carrot cocktails) they started brainstorming. Then, someone glanced at the Ambattur clothing logo — a plump elephant with massive wings and unusually pointed tusk. “The Flying Elephant. It was perfect,” says Amit, with a flourish. We agree. And drink more champagne.

Yann’s determined to walk us through the seven levels of the restaurant. In addition to the drama, the levels ensure that the space doesn’t get overwhelming, since it’s broken into both large and intimate dining sections. There are open kitchens on various levels serving Indian, Turkish, Western and Southeast Asian food. “It’s all the special restaurants you would see in a hotel — but here they’re put into one big entertainment console,” says Amit.

One level up, we spot their retro lift, lacy with iron grills. So we pile in, a mish-mash of elbows, knees and champagne glasses. As the lift rises, we watch the restaurant unfold, like a story in a children’s pop up book. “A friend compared it to Studio 54,” says Amit, looking pleased. The notorious New York nightclub of the late 70s was a landmark of the disco era. Then the lift stops with a jolt. Talk about non-stop drama. As Amit calls for help, Yann and my diva dining companions take pictures of themselves. By the time they Instagram them, we’re moving again. “Teething trouble,” says Amit. No problem at all. This is turning into quite an adventure.

Our evening gets more entertaining. No doubt the Chablis accompanying dinner plays a role. But the space undoubtedly has a cheery vibe. We investigate their private dining area, The Bedroom, encased in glass in true Hip Hop star fashion. After all, what’s the point of going all MTV if there aren’t people to watch jealously? Norwegian executive Chef Stig Drageide joins us as we work our way through a bright, fresh and imaginative dinner. Ricotta with raisins, strawberry compote and rocket salad. Melt-in-the-mouth galouti kebab served on coin-sized saffron parathas. And chewy pan fried calamari presented with a tumble of chorizo, artichokes and bell peppers.

Varied menu

The menu’s designed to ensure you have enough choice, without having to settle for the multi-cuisine staples. So there’s three cheese risotto with dried tomatoes as well as sarson ka saag and makki ki roti. There is chestnut tagliatelle as well as Malaysian kway teow. And of course there are thin crust pizzas: from simple margarita, smeared with ruby red tomato sauce to a hefty Turkish lamb laced with mint and cumin. Our favourite dish for the evening is the unctuous smoky sous vide pork ribs, served with orange zest and mustard.

While the prices can be intimidating, the menu has been designed to try and offer something for everyone. So you can have a gourmet four-course dinner, but also settle down with a burger. Or just an adult shake. An adult shake? “Well, it does sound a bit dodgy,” grins Amit. “So we call them coupes.”

We dive into a coupe, filled with waves of soft serve vanilla ice cream, grand mariner and bright red strawberries. They also have a Bailey’s coffee version with espresso. And a Mont Blanc: vanilla and chocolate ice cream, chestnut vermicelli, meringue, cherries and kirsch.

The Flying Elephant is about drama, sure. But what they’re more excited about is the fact that it’s about joyful dining.

B. Raman, one of India’s first external intelligence agents, died here on Sunday after a battle with cancer. He was 77. Raman served for 26 years in the Research and Analysis wing, right from the day it was carved out of the Intelligence Bureau in September 1968 on Indira Gandhi’s orders, until his retirement in 1994.

An IPS officer of the 1961 Madhya Pradesh cadre, Raman was on deputation to the Intelligence Bureau when he was handpicked by Rameshwar Nath Kao to join R&AW, set up in the aftermath of the wars with China and Pakistan.

He retired as Additional Secretary in the Cabinet Secretariat. In the last six years of his career, he headed R&AW’s counter-terrorism unit. Throughout his career, he was, in his own words, known “as a man with a poker face. As someone who showed no emotion or passion on his face.”

The first assignment that Kao, who headed R&AW, gave him was to be in charge of the agency’s Burma branch. He was there for five years handling analysis as well as clandestine operations, an early phase in his career that earned him the sobriquet ‘Burma Raman’.

In his book, The Kao-boys of R&AW – Down Memory Lane (2007), Raman gave a detailed account of the external intelligence agency’s work that contributed to the liberation of Bangladesh. Kao had given the agency’s operatives two priority tasks — “to strengthen its capability for the collection of intelligence about Pakistan and China and for covert action in East Pakistan.”

In a rare foray by a “spook” into writing about field operations, Raman disclosed that providing intelligence to policy makers and the armed forces, to train Bengali freedom fighters in clandestine camps, to network with Bengali public servants from East Pakistan posted in West Pakistan and in Pakistan’s diplomatic missions abroad to persuade them to cooperate with the freedom fighters and mount a special operation in the Chittagong Hill Tracts where Naga and Mizo hostiles had sanctuaries and training camps.

He recorded the secret negotiations Rajiv Gandhi had on behalf of Indira Gandhi with Sikh leaders before Operation Bluestar in 1984. Indira Gandhi was keen that these be recorded so that posterity would know how she tried in vain for a negotiated solution before she sent the Army into the Golden Temple. Raman was entrusted with this task. He says he had the negotiations secretly recorded and spent endless hours transcribing them. These records were handed over to the organisation’s archives, but nobody knows where these are now.

Raman strongly believed that covert capability was an indispensable tool for any state that had external adversaries. He served as the head of RAW’s counter-terrorism division from 1988 to 1994. He declined an offer by the Narasimha Rao government to be the intelligence coordinator for the north-east after his retirement, preferring to return Chennai.

He was a member of the special task force appointed by the government in 2000 to revamp the intelligence apparatus and a member of the National Security Advisory Board. He was also a member of the committee set up to examine the intelligence failure that led to the Kargil incursion.

In his retirement, especially in the last 10 years, he was active in writing about strategic affairs, touching on a range of internal and external issues. He spoke with precision and clarity. He was quick to respond to sudden and developing events such as terror attacks, posting his perspective and preliminary views on anti-terrorism portals and social media sites. He believed that all strategic thinking and discussion should have the national interests in mind, even though his analysis always took into account the political and social underpinnings of conflicts and crises.

He was active on Twitter as @sorbonne75, and despite his illness, continued to post messages on his timeline on issues of current national interest. In the last week of May, he tweeted that “Ind-Japan shd make China’s seeming strengths into strategic vulnerabilities.”

He also talked about his illness on Twitter, saying he wanted to create awareness of cancer and its treatment. In his very last tweet, on May 31, he spoke optimistically about returning from hospital soon.

The Velachery lake, which has already shrunk due to encroachments, is facing a new threat. Debris is being dumped along the bund encroaching into the lake area on the Velachery side.

The dumping began recently to facilitate construction of shops, which was planned by a section of politicians, allege the residents.

A recent visit to the lake revealed that concrete benches have been put up on the bund located on the Velachery – Adambakkam road. The local politicians were planning to slowly extend the bund further into the lake to facilitate construction of shops along the stretch, the residents alleged.

The lake, which is under the control of Water Resources Department, was originally spread around 108 hectares from Velachery to Adambakkam. But, systematic encroachment over the decades had shrunk the lake to nearly 23 hectares.

The bund on the Velachery side near the Guru Nanak College is already covered with concrete structures. Now, the remaining water spread area is facing a similar threat apart from pollution owing to release of sewage, the residents charged.

Residents, naturalists and researchers said there was a dire need for protecting this huge water body, as it is one of the main sources of fresh water for the residents of Velachery, Adambakkam.

Ranjit Daniels, a biodiversity researcher, said that every year during the northeast monsoon, Velachery gets flooded due to breaching of lake’s bund. A total of 13 species of fish including gouramy, flying barbs, and channa were recorded in the lake.

“The Velachery lake is an important source of aquatic biodiversity, especially of fish.The deep waters are not suited to many birds except coots, dabchicks and grey pelicans,” he said.

A member of local residents’ welfare association said the lake was halved into two with the laying of the bypass road. Protection of this wetland is critical for groundwater recharge.

Though the Water Resources Department had issued eviction notices to nearly 650 families in 2008, it hit a road block in encroachment removal as alternate housing for people was not allotted. All it does now is clear vegetation from the water body before the onset of northeast monsoon at a cost of Rs.19 lakh every year

Elaborate plans were made to introduce boating and creation of parks in the past. However, no such scheme was implemented owing to heavy encroachments.

Residents also alleged that the efforts are on to provide ‘patta’ document for the encroachers of lake area.

Sources at the WRD said that a regulator and a 2.3 km surplus course were constructed from the lake along Bypass Road.

To do so, they compiled data on 136 coastal cities with more than 1 million residents, looking at the elevation of the cities, the population distribution and the types of flood protection they had, such as levees or storm-surge barriers.

They then combined that data with forecasts of sea level rise, ground sinking due to groundwater depletion, as well as population growth projections and economic forecasts of gross domestic product (GDP). From there, they used the depth of water flooding a city to estimate the cost of the damage. [Read full story on coastal flooding]

While for most residents the traffic jams caused by the closing of the Kodambakkam flyover a couple of days ago were a source of hardship, to N. S. Ekambaram it brought back memories of a bygone era.

Mr. Ekambaram, former assistant division engineer who worked on the flyover, said, “The last time I remember the area being so crowded was when the flyover was first opened to the public by the then Chief Minister, M. Bhaktavatsalam. Except, then it was not traffic that jammed the roads but a sea of people!”

The 2039-feet-long Kodambakkam overbridge built across the railway line was declared open on September 16, 1965. With 28 spans and a 32-feet-wide carriageway, the flyover also boasted of white, reflecting kerbs on the sides of the road — a boon to motorists driving at night.

The foundation stone was laid by the State’s Chief Minister K. Kamaraj in 1963 and its construction was completed on September 5, 1965. According to Mr. Ekamabaram, the work was completed two months ahead of schedule. It was the first flyover the State government constructed in the city. Until then, the Madras Corporation Authority had carried out such projects.

Eighty-year-old Mr. Ekambaram reminisced, “As the Chief Minister’s car went over the flyover swarming crowds jumped over the parapets and flooded the road, blocking the Chief Minister’s path for over half-an-hour.”

The Chief Minister, he said, rather than getting annoyed was thrilled at the public’s enthusiasm and waved at the crowds incessantly.

“A ajke adda ta kothai jombe,” asks a young boy as he cycles past an old man in pyjamas. He wants to know the venue for that evening’s gathering/ adda . While most people learn ‘A’ for apple, Bengalis are probably taught ‘A’ for adda . It means conversation among friends and relatives, preferably accompanied with a cup of cha and in Bengal an hour or two of the evening is spent on adda sessions everyday.

“Greams Gate,” replies the old man pointing to one of the many guest houses lining the Mackay’s Garden area. People from all over West Bengal and the neighbouring state of Assam flocking to Chennai for treatment at Apollo, Sankara Nethralaya and other medical institutions in the city often choose to stay in this part of town. The proximity to the institutions is one reason while the other is the feel of being at home. Therefore, it’s hardly surprising this neighbourhood is often referred to as ‘Mini Bengal’. No wonder many of the stores and hotels here have name boards and other information in Bengali.

Seventy-one-year-old Anil Kumar Bhowmick has been coming to Chennai for 21 years now. He spends eight months here. “I always stay at Bava Manzil. I accompany patients from rural areas of West Bengal who can’t speak English and come to Chennai for treatment. I help them and take them to the medical institutions and talk to the doctors.” Like Bhowmick there are many others who accompany groups of patients.

But with Kolkata having good medical facilities, why do people still prefer coming here? “It is our belief that when we come here we will be all right. The doctors here lend a personal touch. People often joke that for many Bengalis this is like a pilgrimage,” laughs Mazumdar, who is here from Jalpaiguri for his mother’s treatment.

Along the road, there’s the distinctive smell of macher jhol emanating from the New Bengal Mess. The unassuming dining area is cramped with people busily tucking into their plates of dal, vegetables and rice. Bacquer Iqbal, who started the mess 15 years ago says, “Apart from the mess we also have 25-30 rooms which see 100 per cent occupancy by Bengalis. Our cooks have been brought from Bengal to cook an authentic fare for our customers, some of whom spend many weeks here.”

Then of course there are those who are particular about the way their meal is cooked. A hint of tamarind in their gravy and they pucker their lips and complain, “Ki tok!” (So sour). And this lot is happy cooking its own meal which is why most guest houses allow occupants to prepare food in their rooms. “I have been here for a month. My husband underwent a surgery and has to be here for the review. We had been craving for home food and also eating out everyday gets expensive. So I prefer cooking myself,” says Mandira Sikdar as she fills her bag with vegetables. The man at the nearby fish stall greets her with a smile and speaks in Bengali with a predominant Tamil accent, “Maach chai na?”( You don’t want fish?) “A few more years and I might speak Bangla better than Tamil,” he jokes as he hands her macher muro (fish head).

The stores in the vicinity stock up everything a Bengali needs for his/her meal. The shop assistant at a grocery and general utilities store that gets about 150 Bengali clients a day, says, “Of course there are the pulses and rice, but mustard oil gets sold out really fast. The stores selling utensils earn a quick buck too. A lot of these shops have hired Bengali-speaking assistants.

It’s 6 p.m. and the area is lighting up. Roadside vendors are setting up stalls…toys, household items, knick knacks, food including jalebi, samosa, phuchka… “It’s good to unwind here after a hectic day of running to and from the hospitals. I have to shop for Durga Puja. I’ll be spending the festival here. My family is in Midnapore and it’s just my brother and me. But in Mackay’s Garden it’s like being at home,” smiles Pritam Bannerjee. Meanwhile an acquaintance stops him for a chat “ Dada kemon achein ?” Here everybody is referred to as dada, didi, boudi and it’s the road where everyone knows your name.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Some of the earliest images of Madras show a fishing village, with its cloak of nets, lengthy boats and turbaned men rushing towards the waters of the Marina as tall palms sway in the background. As this village grew, the need for connecting the villages that lay across various rivers and canals, and not just by boats, grew. Bridges were built, first of wood and then of brick and mortar, and villages grew closer and closer until they became the city of Madras. Some of these bridges, as old as the city itself, continue to exist (albeit in different forms and names), even today.

While there is some documentation of the bridges that existed in the British era, it is rather difficult to determine their exact location now (some of them are visible in Thomas Pitt’s map of 1711 and others in maps that were drawn as the city grew) given the evolution of the city in the last three hundred years. This two-part series tries to locate these bridges and record their existence.

Hemachandra Rao, an architect by profession and a lover of old Madras, has been chronicling the history of its bridges over many years. “You must remember that they were constructed to hold bullock carts and not cars,” he says, “all built out of brick, mortar and lime but their architecture and strength are evident, as they continue to bear the weight of the city’s traffic. Madras has about 29 beautiful arched bridges that have been a part of the city for many years.”

Among the oldest bridges on record is what used to be called the Barber’s Bridge in San Thome. While popular theory attributes it to a Hamilton, the Vestiges of Old Madras by Henry Davidson Love goes back even further. It mentions that a natural drainage channel on the north side of St. Thome was crossed by Barber’s Bridge. While it was initially called Hamilton, a name that was corrupted into Ambattan by the locals, the original bridge was probably built by the Portuguese, as there is a mention of it during the French occupation of San Thome in 1672-1674 (On the 3rd October De La Haye led the troops to a bridge on the north side, 500 paces distant, where a skirmish took place). This is, of course, prior to the British influence over the area. The Hindu Archives even has a photo of a plaque that used to be on the old bridge, according to which the bridge was built ‘at about 1600’, before it was rebuilt.

H.D. Love’s book also says that Ensign James Hamilton, an engineer who was killed at Madura in 1764 was the only known person with that name, further making us wonder if he had rebuilt it in the 1700s. The bridge still exists in a different form just adjacent to Citi Centre mall (it was recently renamed Dr. Ambedkar Bridge).

Following close behind is the Armenian Gate Bridge, which connected Black Town and Peddanaikpetta. According to H.D. Love’s book, it is said to have been built around or a little before 1677, as it was called the ‘new bridge’ then. During the floods of 1720 and 1721, the bridge was damaged, as it was built with timber on brick abutments. It was rebuilt in 1725. It was demolished when the French briefly occupied the fort between 1746 and 1749.

Egmore bridge, which is described as the ‘cut connecting the Elambore and Triplicane rivers’ was erected as early as 1703. There were problems and the foundation was washed out and rebuilt. Soon, an arch gave way and the bridge was again repaired and put up in 1728. It still exists as the St. Mary’s Bridge (probably because of its proximity to the St. Mary’s cemetery, which leads us to think that this might be the bridge that leads to Central Station as you take a left from Periyar Bridge). The old bridge seems to have made appearances in movies such as VaranamAayiram and Madrasapattinam . Because platforms were built on both sides, the arches of the old bridge and the canal are no longer visible.

The exact location of the bridge is recorded in the Madras Tercentenary Commemoration Volume , which says Noah Cosa Major’s (after whom Casa Major Road is named) house was “in the north-west corner of the island, between the roads leading to Egmore and Chintadripetta. The latter, in fact, forked beyond Cosa Major’s house, one branch leading to Egmore Bridge, and the other to Triplicane Bridge and Chintadripetta.”

The Armenian Gate Bridge and the Egmore Bridge are recorded in Pitt’s Map. “The bridges in the city were distributed over three rivers,” says Hemachandra Rao, “Cooum, Adyar and Buckingham canal, all built in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries with arches. These arches were built so that the bridges were stable.” It also enabled navigation by river.

Connectivity between OMR and ECR, two important roads in south Chennai, is set to improve with the Highways getting the go-ahead for the alignment of a 1.4-km-long four-lane road.

The road that will take off from the Thoraipakkam–Pallavaram Radial Road junction on OMR is likely to pass through a portion of a government higher secondary school, private, vacant lands as well as land at Neelankarai.

A high-level steering committee of the State government, which met recently, has approved the alignment of the road that was initially proposed by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA).

“The CMDA had frozen approvals on this alignment, which means land owners could not get permissions for construction. In effect, land owners who had constructed before the freeze on construction came into force will get compensation for the building also. We are also planning to construct a bridge on the new road,” explained a source in the highways department.

The 30.5 metre-wide road will have service lanes, footpaths and stormwater drains.

The 11-km stretch extending from Thiruvanmiyur to Shollinganallur does not have any links between the two highways other than a few pedestrian bridges across the Buckingham Canal that runs between OMR and ECR.

C. Janakiraman, a resident of Perungudi, said most times he used Pandian Salai, a narrow road near Seevaram that runs up to Kottivakkam. “Apart from a bridge at Kandanchavady, the bridge on Pandian Salai is the only other link between ECR and OMR. It is in bad shape and just a mud road. During rains, it gets flooded. But we have no other option. Big vehicles cannot use the road,” he said.

The department also proposes to strengthen and widen two more roads, and construct bridges on them connecting ECR and OMR.

One bridge will take off from opposite MGR Salai or new Veeranam Salai (Lifeline Hospital junction) and go via Kamarajar Salai to reach ECR. The other bridge will come up just behind the Perungudi Industrial Estate and join ECR at Kajura Garden.

The widening would result in better connectivity for residents of ECR to areas including Tambaram, Pallikaranai and Velachery.

“To reach the airport I go via Thiruvanmiyur and Guindy or go via SRP Tools and take the Velachery Road. In the Guindy area, there is a lot of traffic congestion and as it is so unpredictable, I prefer not to take that route,” said Sultan Ismail, a resident of Palavakkam.

“It will be a big boon for a lot of residents on ECR if new roads come up. They will help ease traffic congestion at the Thiruvanmiyur and Akkarai junctions. A lot of vehicles would take the newly proposed roads between OMR and ECR,” he added.

This step would also help decongest OMR, which carries around 50,000 vehicles a day.",solution,Chennai Floods 2015,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015","['Chennai', 'Tambaram', 'Maduravoyal', 'Vadapalani', 'Adyar', 'Velachery', 'Perungudi', 'Koyambedu', 'Nungambakkam', 'Anna Nagar', 'Kundrathur', 'Manali', 'Ambattur', 'Ponneri', 'Thiruvallur', 'Chengalpattu', 'Kancheepuram', 'Tiruvannamalai', 'Vellore', 'Krishnagiri', 'Tiruchirappalli', 'Thanjavur', 'Nagapattinam', 'Cuddalore', 'Ariyalur', 'Perambalur', 'Tiruchirapalli', 'Dharmapuri', 'Salem', 'Erode', 'Namakkal', 'Karur', 'Coimbatore', 'The Nilgiris', 'Dindigul', 'Pudukkottai', 'Ramanathapuram', 'Virudhunagar', 'Tuticorin', 'Kanyakumari']","['120 cm in Chennai', '100 cm in Kancheepuram', '80 cm in Tiruvallur', '60 cm in Cuddalore', '40 cm in Thanjavur', '20 cm in Tiruchirappalli', '10 cm in Madurai', '5 cm in Coimbatore']","['100,000 houses damaged', '500,000 people displaced', '100 people killed', '10 billion dollars in damages']",,"['Transportation disrupted', 'Power outages', 'Water contamination', 'Food shortages', 'Health problems', 'Economic losses']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Farmers in Kancheepuram staged a demonstration on Tuesday demanding compensation for land they gave to the government for the Kancheepuram Bypass.

According to G. Mani, one of the protesters, around 85 farmers from the villages of Keezh Ambi, Thiruparuthi Kundram, Sevilimedu, Keezh Kathirpur and Putheri had to give up over 800 acres of land to make way for the two-lane ring road.

The Rs. 34-crore stretch takes off from NH4 near Vella gate in Kancheepuram and goes up to Sevilimedu. The road offers connectivity to SIPCOT estate in Cheyyar. Land required to make the stretch a four-lane facility has been acquired.

The farmers said they had not receive dues of over Rs. 2.80 crore. They also demanded interest on the amount and sought compensation for the loss of their livelihood.

The highways department said Rs. 2.80 crore had been deposited with the revenue department towards compensation for the farmers.

Another protester S. Mani said the government had turned down their suggestion for an alternate route via Vedavalli river and Keezh Ambi lake.

“Government officials told us the road had to be completed within the stipulated time and so we handed over our land before the compensation came through. Now they are making us run from pillar to post for our rightful dues. If they do not want to give cash, why don’t they give land as compensation?” he said.

The bypass cuts across the lands of several farmers. Mr. S. Mani said a farmer in Keezh Ambi lost all his 30 cents of land. He used to harvest around 14 bags of chillies and rear pigs on that property.

“He had taken a loan of Rs. 2 lakh from the bank. Now, he has to repay with interest. He does not have any land and badly needs the compensation.

Prayers resumed at the Kedarnath shrine on Wednesday morning after the Gandhi sarovar overflowed and flooded Kedarnath on June 17.

The prayers, which were resumed within 3 months of the catastrophe, started at 7 a.m. on Wednesday. Vageeshling, who is a representative of the Rawal (chief priest) said, “Rawal Bhimashankar Ling started the purification of the temple along with other priests, people from the State administration, and the members of the Badrinath-Kedarnath Temple Commiittee.”

Prayers started after the purification was over, Vageeshling said.

Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna was unable to attend the prayers as inclement weather prevented him from travelling.

A rock, believed to have saved the temple from the floods by preventing the flood waters from destroying the temple, was also worshipped. Some priests have named the rock Divya Shila (divine rock) while others call it the Bheem Shila.

The prayers continued till evening. Rameshwar Jamloki, a priest in the temple said, “From Thursday, the prayers will start in the morning and will continue till the evening. This routine will be followed till the beginning of the Diwali festival after which the prayers in the temple will be over for the year and will resume only next year.”

The prayers started on May 14 this year but stopped on June 17. Between June 17 and September 11, Vageeshling continued the prayers of the Bhog murti, which is a symbol of lord Shiva. The Bhog murti was shifted to Garudchatti on June 18. From there, it was moved to Okhimath on June 20 and it continued to be worshipped there before it was brought to Kedarnath temple for the prayers.

On Wednesday, around 300 people attended the prayers. Dilip Jawalkar, District Magistrate, Rudraprayag, said, “In the last one month around 800 people have been deployed here, including the people from the Public Works Department, hydel power, and water department.”

The police, the National Disaster Response Force personnel, and members of the National Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) were also stationed here.

The June 17 deluge had destroyed the buildings around the Kedarnath temple. The landscape is covered with the after effects of the deluge. Though the prayers have resumed, it would take many years for Kedarnath to be rebuilt.

A three-member team from the Geological Survey of India (GSI) has been mapping the Kedarnath area from September 9. The GSI would give a report to the government based on which the rebuilding of the area would take place.

The NIM has currently placed tents 2 km away from the temple. Some pre-fabricated huts have also been placed here. Water facility and electricity have been resumed in the area.

Mr. Jawalkar said locals, who live nearby, can visit the temple after taking the authorities’ permission. Pilgrims, however, would not be allowed to visit the temple till September 30.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

P izza II: Villa begins with a flickering light bulb and, a little distance away, a paranormal scientist holding up a tuning fork — he’s looking for… something. Later, in an interview, he reveals that he has never been afraid, and that he is waiting for the day he will experience fear. We think that this man’s wish will come true, that he will regret these words because of the terrifying situation he will find himself in — but that never happens. Or maybe it happens and we don’t register it because the performances in this film don’t add up.

Elsewhere, the “clues” (like the decomposing carcass of a dog) don’t add up — we wait for the why behind these happenings, and there are no satisfactory answers. But as a painting teacher instructs his students, early on, the most important thing in an art form is the ambience. Those could be the director Deepan Chakravarthy’s words. What Pizza II: Villa lacks in other departments, it makes up for with mood.

Unlike its in-name-only predecessor, Pizza II: Villa isn’t about a hoax. It isn’t a horror movie either — at least, not in the conventional sense of a narrative that aims to make you jump out of your seat and turn the lights on at night. The film isn’t without the genre’s trusted (and if you stop to think about it, stupid) tropes. Someone in a huge mansion where things are going bump in the night will continue to stay on, instead of moving somewhere safer, and when he finds a room with something terrifying inside, he will continue to investigate these horrors.

But the director is after something more elegant, more muted. He doesn’t want so much to scare us as infuse in us a sustained sense of dread. The background score isn’t silence-screams-silence-screams, but long and seemingly unvarying notes and chords that swell, occasionally, into crescendos. The effect is eerie, not scary. Pizza II: Villa , then, is a horror movie for those who don’t particularly care for horror movies.

The story is something that Stephen King might have dreamt up. A struggling crime-novel writer (Ashok Selvan) inherits a villa, and when he moves in his life changes. But even as he revels in the turnaround (a publishing contract; an award), he senses that malevolent forces may be behind it all. (Or maybe the spirit of Kate Mosse is behind it all. One of the author’s bestsellers is seen on a tabletop, and as in that book, there’s a creepy Frenchman here.)

An unexpected — and welcome — side-effect of these happenings is that the protagonist is never allowed to become a hero. He is in over his head — as we discover through a tragic murder, forewarned isn’t always forearmed. Evil always has the upper hand. The ending, thus, is inevitable. We sit up expecting a twist, revealed with a flourish, but the understated nature of what actually happens is perhaps the bigger twist. With the tease of a sequel, we may be witnessing a quality franchise in the making.

Music maestro Ilaiyaraaja’s ‘pattu poovey mettu paadu’ from the film Chembaruthi plays in full volume in DTS 5.1 six-channel audio and all those listening have goose bumps. There are six audio speakers — left, centre vocal, right, left surround, right surround, and subwoofer that capture the nuances — and the music leaves you stunned. You can thank A.Muthusamy of Honeybee Studio in Coimbatore for the experience. “More than 300 music artists contribute to a song in a live recording. When you listen to it in six-channels, you appreciate every individual effort. DTS gives a 360-degree experience which you can enjoy with your eyes closed. The market is flooded with digital surround players that compress the six channels only into two. What we experience is a mere digital surround effect,” he rues.

Muthusamy does this by a manual enhancing process, where he picks Ilaiyaraaja’s songs from old films, separates the six channels, and enhances every channel in quality and strength to suit the latest audio format, without tampering with the original composition.

So far, he has completed 5,500 songs from 100 films, all released between 1976 and 1981. They are from films such as Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri , 16 Vayadhiniley , Annakili , Ilamai Oonjalaadukirathu , Aval Appadithaan , Bhadrakaali and Paalooti Valartha Kili

Painstaking process

“His music genius is unparalleled. No one can replicate it. My wish is that maestro’s music should reach the public in original DTS six-channel format and in Hi-Fi stereo,” he says.

Manual enhancing is a painstaking process which takes up to 25 hours for a single song, where he divides the frequencies as LCR (Left, Centre, and Right), LS (Left Surround), RS (Right Surround) and Sub Woofer. “I keep rolling the mouse for over 20 hours to separate the channels manually without any software,” explains Muthusamy, and adds “ ulakkaila idichi idichi arisi edukurathu mathiri…”

Through the process, one can build a crystal clear archive of old songs, and offer an original music experience.

“Please tell ayya (maestro) if you like it,” says Muthusamy as he hands over a CD at his nondescript studio. “You are also free to complain if you didn’t like it,” he says, but with an air of confidence.

He has distributed a select number of CDs in Madurai and Coimbatore to get a feedback from the public.

As we listen to ‘Ilamai idho idho’ from Sakalakala Vallavan , Muthusamy says, “Hi-fi stereo is God’s gift to music. It is an audio format that is created in tune with the human body. Stereo music (in two tracks) is the most natural music as we have a left ear (treble) and a right ear (bass) and the central channel (mind) which brings the balance. The golden period of stereophonic recording lasted till 2000. Then, 5.7 Dolby Digital Surround used in home theatre took over and that marked the death of DTS.”

An electronics service engineer from Coimbatore, Muthusamy has worked in various companies including Solitaire, Dyanora, and National Panasonic for over 30 years, till he took it upon himself to create awareness about DTS.

“Original sound brings clarity and depth to a composition. Mouna Guru was one of the last films in theatres that gave a 360-degree experience on a 70 mm screen in original sound. Audio companies and producers who have the rights to a film’s music failed to create awareness on original music.”

For over five years, Muthusamy has been campaigning for awareness on DTS. He released a number of print advertisements, and even secured a license to build customised Analog DTS players. “I went to China to learn the technology and customise the player. Though I lost over Rs.2 crores in the process, I sold 5,000 players in Tamil Nadu and the number translates to awareness,” he says with pride.

Unmatched compositions

Muthusamy has sourced the original master tracks of 600 films of Ilaiyaraaja’s compositions from audio companies in India, U.K., the U.S., and Canada. He also has original audio wrappers of all the films.

Now, he has begun working on Maestro’s tracks of the next batch of films, from 1982 onwards. “I want Ayya to take it to the public. I have listened to every single song of Ilaiyaraaja over 1000 times inch by inch while enhancing the channels. The music arrangement he brings to every composition is unmatched.”

According to this sound wizard, Ilaiyaraaja’s mind is the best music instrument. Every piece of his music is a perfect creation. We listen to music through instruments. For him, it plays out beautifully in his mind. And, that’s what makes him a maestro,” he says and closes his eyes as Ilaiyaraaja’s ‘Idhayam Oru Koil’ washes over us.

Meeting Ilaiyaraaja

Muthusamy remembers meeting Ilaiyaraaja. It was in January 2012 at Prasad Studios in Chennai. “I checked the tape recorder, the alignment of the speakers and played ‘Poomalaye Thol Sera Vaa’ from Pagal Nilavu… The next minute, he spoke to me. “Idha Pannunga”, he said, and gave me the tape of ‘Ananda Raagam’ from Paneer Pushpangal. I completed it the same day. He then asked me to continue with the other songs.” Muthusamy wants to enhance all of Ilaiyaraaja’s Tamil songs in DTS and hi-fi stereo, and exhibit them at the London Museum.

Legal take

Advocate Muthu Krishnan, a guiding force to Muthusamy, says: “Once songs cross 25 years, anyone is free to enhance it. However, audio companies can object if they fear ‘reputation injury’ or when the songs are used for commercial purposes.”

Note-worthy

Uncompressed music CDs are compatible with the latest home theatre players, Blue ray, 3D players and car stereos that are hi-fi enabled. The file size of each song a single song in such an uncompressed format runs up to 60 MB. More than 40 websites that offer free download of Ilaiyaraaja’s songs, but they are compressed 3 MB files, which kills the effect. “When youngsters listen to DTS six tracks and hi-fi stereo audio, they know what they have missed. Then they won’t accept any form of compressed music that is available on pen drives, FM radio, MP3 and iPods,” says Muthusamy.",solution,Tamil Nadu Floods 2015,"Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 31, 2015","['Chennai', 'Tamil Nadu', 'India']","['Chennai: 1,000 mm', 'Tamil Nadu: 1,500 mm', 'India: 2,000 mm']","['100,000 homes destroyed', '10,000 people displaced', '$1 billion in damages']","['500 people', '100,000 animals']","['Major disruption to transportation', 'Loss of crops', 'Waterborne diseases']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The Bhagavata Purana depicts the situation preceding Krishna avatar graphically. Kamsa’s atrocities remain unabated even as he is warned by a celestial voice of his own end at the hands of the eighth child of Devaki, his own sister. Unable to withstand the persecution of Kamsa, Bhudevi and the celestial beings beseech Brahma for alleviation of their suffering. He counsels them to seek refuge in the Lord, who is ever-willing to come to the rescue of the oppressed.

The Lord communicates to Brahma that His incarnation will bring the much-needed succour and that He will be born in the house of Vasudeva with Adisesha preceding Him to be born as elder brother Balarama. During the incarnation, the celestial beings as members of Yadu clan will aid Him in the fight against evil. The Lord designates Yogamaya’s functions at this juncture, explained Akkarakani T. A. Srinidhi Swami in a discourse.

Yogamaya is the Lord’s divine power by which creation is enabled. The Lord assigns her specific tasks, the first to protect the foetus in Devaki’s seventh pregnancy by transferring it to Vasudeva’s wife Rohini living in the land of Yadus out of fear of Kamsa. Next the incarnation of the Lord as Devaki’s eighth child and the birth of Yogamaya herself as the daughter of Yasodha and Nanda are charted out. Accepting the directives readily, the Devi descends to the earth to accomplish her mission. With Adisesha born as Balarama, Krishna and Yogamaya are successfully swapped at birth despite almost insurmountable hurdles — Kamsa’s tight security and vigilance, the torrential rains, the Yamuna in spate, etc — all through the Lord’s inherent power of Maya.

When Kamsa tries to smash his infant niece against a stone slab, Yogamaya escapes from his hold and assumes the form of the eight-handed goddess who has incarnated as the Lord’s sister. She plants seeds of fear in Kamsa when she warns him against killing of helpless infants, revealing that his enemy is born somewhere else.

533,1072,chennai,2013,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/FvpXSl7v5JClJIPjyDLejO/The-desalination-dilemma.html,23 May 2013,Nemmeli plant: The desalination dilemma,"Chennai: One day in April, Shyamala Sitaraman, a resident of Chennai’s Valmiki Nagar, discovered that her underground tank was overflowing. Sumps are an essential part of life in the water-starved Tamil Nadu capital—the taps are left open to collect the thin trickle supplied by the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board but the tanks never fill up.

The overflowing tank was therefore a matter of some astonishment. And it wasn’t just hers, every underground tank in the neighbourhood was overflowing, flooding the streets.

Sitaraman, 70, and several others called the water board. “We thought some pipe had been broken and water was just overflowing,"" she said.

Two days and several calls later, Sitaraman had her answer—she was receiving water from the Nemmeli desalination plant 25 km away.

“It is unbelievable—making potable water from sea water,"" says Sitaraman, whose home in southern Chennai is near the beach. She could “have never imagined it"".

Chennai, with a coastline that stretches about 26 km along India’s east, may well be among the first Indian cities to depend on desalination for most of its water needs.

Last month, Tamil Nadu chief minister J. Jayalalithaa announced a plan to install another desalination plant next to the newly inaugurated Nemmeli facility to treat 150 million litres per day (mld) of sea water, costing ₹ 1,000 crore.

That will be in addition to a plant being set up in Pattipulam near Chennai with a capacity to treat 200 mld of sea water, expandable to 400 mld, expected to be completed in four years. The state’s first desalination facility began operating in Minjur in Thiruvallur district in 2010. Both this and the Nemmeli plant have a capacity of 100 mld each.

Add this up and Chennai could have a total supply of 550-750 mld of desalinated water in a few years. That’s 66-90% of the 831 mld of drinking water Chennai’s 4.6 million residents need today.

While the country is home to several low-capacity plants, this is the first time that any state has set up desalination units with a capacity of 100 mld. While Andhra Pradesh and Orissa are also debating the prospects of setting up such plants, Gujarat seems to be further along the way towards having its own desalination units.

But building that capacity won’t be easy.

The Nemmeli plant inaugurated in February was delayed for years by political bickering and execution hurdles. The plant was to be built at a cost of ₹ 1,000 crore to pump out 300 mld of treated sea water. While the cost remained at ₹ 1,000 crore, the capacity was whittled down to 100 mld.

It was the first large Centrally funded desalination facility to be announced in the country, by P. Chidambaram in July 2004. He was then Union finance minister as he is now, having been the home minister for a time in between.

After the announcement, the Union and the Tamil Nadu governments took about four years to reach a consensus on aspects such as the location and the agency that would build the plant, with Jayalalithaa and Chidambaram blaming the other for the delays. The state government then took two more years to seek bids for the project.

The winning consortium of Chennai-based water management company Va Tech Wabag and Israel-based IDE Technologies Ltd, which specialises in desalination, needed another three years to complete the plant. It has a contract to manage the plant for the next seven years.

The construction was interrupted by the Jal cyclone in November 2010 that washed away a pipeline into the sea, and the Thane cyclone in December 2011 that caused heavy destruction to the marine works, said Rajiv Mittal, managing director of Va Tech Wabag.

“Projects are announced by government in pomp and glory but it takes years before they are finally implemented,"" says 81-year-old A.K. Sitaraman, Shyamala’s husband.

Desalination isn’t seen as a natural fit for India, despite the country being a peninsula, mainly because of the costs involved. The technology—of separating brine from sea water to make it potable for daily use—is expensive and energy-intensive. That’s why it’s adopted mostly by countries in the Arabian Gulf such as Saudi Arabia that have the money and abundant energy supplies while lacking adequate sources of water—they account for over 50% of world capacity.

Apart from the cost, for every 100 mld of sea water treated, only 40 mld is made potable and the remaining 60 mld of concentrated saline water has to be discharged into the sea.

This discharge by desalination plants impacts marine ecology, says S.S Sivakumar, managing trustee of Pure Water Foundation, Thiruvanmiyur, an organization focused on increasing the availability of clean water to the poor through environmentally safe solutions.

Despite this, “increasing population, industrialization and demand for fresh water has been driving (the) India desalination market, which is all set to grow further at CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of around 22% for next five years,"" TechSci Research, a global market research firm, said in a 2012 report.

Growth in India is faster than initially anticipated, TechSci said. It sees India acting as a growth engine for the global water desalination industry.

Corrado Sommariva, president of the US-based International Desalination Association lobby group, insists that the overall lifecycle cost and tariffs, ranging between $0.7 and $1.5 per cubic metre globally, are almost comparable with that of traditional water suppliers.

B. Chandramohan, managing director of the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, admitted water produced by the process was expensive, but declined to comment on the cost of producing one litre of desalinated water.

Among other coastal states in India, Gujarat is also investing heavily in desalination plants. In March, a consortium of Japanese and Singaporean companies signed a pact with the Gujarat government to build a 300 mld desalination plant in Dahej, involving an investment of about ₹ 3,000 crore.

Chennai suffers frequent droughts. The three main waterlines—the Cooum and Adyar rivers and the Buckingham Canal—that flow through the city en route to the Bay of Bengal are too polluted or scant for regular use or to replenish ground water. Most of the average annual rainwater of 1,200-1,300 mm that Chennai receives—more than Bangalore’s 900 mm or Delhi’s 800 mm average—flows into the sea.

The southern city may be headed for another year of scarce water supply because of poor rainfall last year. The combined water level of the three main reservoirs—Poondi, Chembarakkam and Red Hills—that supply water to Chennai was at 2,922 million cubic feet ( it is 2,889) on 8 May, down 47% (it is 48 %) from a year ago.

Desalination cannot be a solution in itself, says R.Sakthivadivel, emeritus professor at the Centre of Water Resources at Anna University, a premier technology institute in Tamil Nadu.

Leaks and pilferage are the bane of Chennai’s water distribution network, he says, adding that only 65% of the water from the city’s treatment plants reach consumers while in Germany this is as high as 95%. That gap needs to be plugged, especially if the people of the state are paying a heavy price for water that’s currently gushing through some of Chennai’s taps.

The corps units will come up in Chennai with a strength of 500 persons, 200 in Mahabalipuram (Kancheepuram district), and 100 members each in Madurai, Tirunelveli and Tiruchirappalli districts, an official release said.

The necessity for such corps arose as there was a need for large number of human resources in areas affected by natural calamities like cyclone or floods, and to carry out rescue operations swiftly to ensure early return of normalcy. The members will assist state government officials during such times, it said.

Chief minister J. Jayalalithaa has sanctioned Rs89 lakh towards training and non-recurring expenses involved for this proposal and the respective district collectors will function as district controller of these corps, it said.

Further, announcing a slew of measures for police personnel, the chief minister sanctioned Rs100 crore as first instalment of the Rs473.05 crore towards housing scheme. She has directed construction of 4340 residences this year.

Modernization of check-posts at Rs4.15 crore, an allocation of Rs14.95 crore towards establishment of training facilities for new recruits and creation of new posts in the Forensic Science centres at Coimbatore and Tiruchirappalli, besides procuring new equipment there at Rs53.25 lakh were other announcements made by the chief minister.

As layer upon layer of debris is gradually hauled away to reveal to us the numbing scale of death and destruction in Uttarakhand, you can’t but help wonder whether it could trigger a crisis of faith and redefine the complicated relationship involving man, society and god. The prevailing contours of this relationship are fraught with elements conducive to the severity with which disasters strike India.

All natural calamities, from tsunamis and earthquakes in Asia to tornadoes in America, fundamentally challenge the notion of god as omnipotent, omniscient, and all-loving. This challenge now seems enhanced manifold as the tragedy in Uttarakhand also befell the thousands who were on pilgrimage to the four dhams — of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. Their religious fervour pulled them to the Himalayas, in the hope of earning benediction and salvation. For them to die in what was for them moments of extreme piety, or see their relatives perish in torrents of water or get crushed under rolling boulders, not only seemed frightfully irrational but an unpardonable betrayal by the god (or gods) who they had gone to worship.

No doubt, the unpredictable ferocity of nature, indiscriminate construction, and environmental degradation combined to wreak mammoth destruction in Uttarakhand. Yet the believer, irrespective of whether or not his or her religious heritage entails treating reality as illusion, can’t but ask the questions that the atheist typically poses: is not god supposed to protect people, at least the pious ones, from calamities? What wisdom does god have in raining down destruction on the world?

These questions constitute the arsenal of philosophers who argue against the existence of god. They broadly divide evil into two categories — horrific actions man perpetrates against others and disasters or accidents which claim lives. If god existed, all-powerful and all-loving, wouldn’t he have created a world without evil, unless, obviously, he derives perverse pleasures from the suffering of people? Their ideological rivals counter it saying a world without evil would have made free will redundant, and blurred distinctions between good and repugnant.

Contrary response

The free-will argument is relevant to the evil that man wilfully spawns, such as massacres, but can’t be extended to devastating earthquakes and floods. It is a consequence of, from the perspective of faith, the will of god. Yet, as the votaries of faith argue, the scale of destruction can be mitigated through measures humans can take. For instance, constructing buildings resistant to earthquakes in areas vulnerable to this geological phenomenon, or keeping ready a disaster management plan, or, as in Uttarakhand, not raising structures in flood plains or denuding forests that help check landslides.

Though the atheists justifiably cite the economic costs some of these measures entail — the owner of a thatched hut can’t make it earthquake-resistant, can he? — to argue against the existence of god, the believer, nevertheless, could incorporate elements of the atheist’s arguments to revisit and redefine the idea of god.

Unfortunately, the disaster in Uttarakhand has triggered a contrary response. Many believe the dead were blessed for they were called to the abodes of gods, or holy places, to breathe their last, glossing over the torment they must have experienced as their life withered away. This is almost a universal response to pilgrims dying, say, in a stampede in the Haj or kumbh melas , and underscores the attempts of humans to reconcile themselves to what is cruelly incomprehensible. Yet, it is contradictory for the pious to praise God in the same breath for choosing some to die, and for saving many others from being crushed, as has happened in Uttarakhand.

Through such beliefs we seek to rationalise the randomness of life and inject meanings into absurd situations. From this perspective, god is turned into an imperious lord, killing people or keeping them alive in accordance with his whims. Obviously, the faithful believes the actions of god have a higher reasoning beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals, who are condemned to take birth or die at an appointed hour.

Selective

In our attempts to reconcile to what is seemingly incomprehensible we have not only turned irrational but also compromised the value of human will. Despite the terrible tragedy in Uttarakhand, there is a whisper of astonishment at the Kedarnath temple having remained intact even as several buildings around it were washed away in the floods. A leading Hindi daily, boasting multiple editions, featured on the front page of its national edition two photographs of the area in which the Kedarnath temple is located, depicting the scene before and after nature wreaked havoc. The combined caption to the photographs says, “Nature destroyed everything but call it coincidence or miracle, no harm came to the abode of Baba Kedarnath.”

In the second frame, clicked post-devastation, are also visible a few structures, which the caption blithely ignores. We don’t know whether those buildings were damaged or defied the fury of nature because of “coincidence or miracle.” This selective assigning of meaning portrays God as selfish, raining down havoc on people even as he insulated a place of worship from devastation.

Could there not be geological or architectural reasons for the Kedarnath temple withstanding the impact of gushing waters? Is it not possible that the building material of the Kedarnath temple, presumably sourced locally, was superior to the bricks and mortar constructions of the present times? Might not this world view explain our indifference to, say, building laws, sound architectural principles, and rapacious violation of the environment?

Such questions are not largely asked as commercial gains accrue from promoting a religiosity of an irrational kind. Traditionally, pilgrimage and yatras symbolised a rite of passage, an enduring of physical hardship and spiritual confusions, to pay respect to gods in their abodes. Modernity has made possible instant spirituality, as thousands are ferried by buses and cars, even helicopters, for paying obeisance to god.

What is needed is to rescue god from meanings and attributes we assign to him. In this, the priestly class could play a vital role. But what hope can we derive from stories of pujaris walking away with the donations, running into lakhs of rupees, of which a portion must have been the contribution of those who perished in Uttarakhand?

As many as 123 bodies were recovered from the Kedarnath shrine premises in Uttarakhand after a team of experts scoured the venue on Saturday. The death toll from the flood calamity is now 680.

“Kedarnath has been totally cleared of pilgrims now and the next step would be to evacuate pilgrims from Badrinath, where nearly 8,000 people are still stranded,” Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna told reporters here on Saturday.

The Chief Minister said the restoration of the Kedarnath shrine was a priority and the State would take suggestions from the Archaeological Survey of India.

The Chief Minister said the casualty figures could easily touch the 1,000-mark.

More bodies may come to the surface in the next couple of days as the slush and debris lying in the area is being removed, said the official who did not want to be quotedMr. Bahuguna said both Central and State governments were trying their best to rescue stranded people. He said out of the 1,000 pilgrims sighted in Junglechatti area near Gaurikund earlier today, 400 have been evacuated. Food and medicines have been provided to the rest.

Mr. Bahuguna said the evacuation would be hastened after broken roads were restored: “I take heart from the fact that 529 breached roads have been repaired by the PWD. Pilgrims are being brought to Haridwar from Fata and Guptkashi areas.”

He said the bodies recovered would be disposed of as per traditional rituals and a Mahayagya held in Haridwar on the 13th day of the tragedy for the peace of the departed souls.

Even as criticism has been levelled about the efficiency of the rescue efforts in the State, some survivors were all praise for the Army.

Sukhvinder Singh, a Ludhiana native who was stuck for eight days on the way to Hemkunt Sahib, said: “The Army gave us food and water and helped us. Had they not been here, we wouldn’t have survived.”

Aman Bisht, who organises annual treks to the gurudwara, said: “The road links were shattered and we had no bridges left. And even if there was a road somewhere, it was broken. The Army has been very supportive.”

Family members and friends of those, who are stranded or missing in the hill state, have come to the capital city and are desperately searching hospitals and camps to get some news about their loved ones.

Another man alleged that “priority is being given to foreigners while Indians are left behind to die. My children have been stranded there for the last eight days without food and water.”",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

July 1

I live on Khader Nawaz Khan Road. The foot path adjacent to our house is over a foot high, making it difficult for me at my age to negotiate the footpath. I am forced to use the road, which has a blind corner leading up to the property. Does the foot path have to be so high?

Mrs. Ramaswami, Khader Nawaz Khan Road

Citizens in Chennai are agitated over the encroachment of footpaths. But in Jai Nagar, Arumbakkam half of an entire street is encroached by fencing. The street in question is 12th street Jai Nagar, Arumbakkam, Chennai-600106. Efforts in the past to restore the actual stretch of the road to the Corporation and the Revenue authorities have not borne fruit. The Chennai Corporation has provided street lights, but has failed to retrieve the land from the encroachers. Access for public utility vehicles to this street and other adjoining streets are denied by these encroachments.

C.K.Parameswaran, Arumbakkam

This refers to the elaborate story “Where is my footpath?” (The Hindu July 1). It is a well known fact that pavements in city are invariably encroached upon by different people, poor to rich, patronised by political functionaries as well as government agencies like Corporation of Chennai, CMDA and Highways Department.

To point out a few encroachments in city, the pavement close to Institute of Mental Health in Kilpauk is occupied by many temples and monuments under the very nose of highways and PWD.

The Konnur high road pavement between Ayanavaram traffic signal and Otteri Bridge is totally occupied by slum dwellers depriving the privilege of pedestrians. Thanks to this, the storm water drains department finds it difficult to connect the proposed drain into Otteri Nullah.

The pavement as well as land belonging to CMWSSB on New Avadi road beginning from Villivakkam Nathamuni signal and Kilpauk pumping station and VOC Nagar junction is also under encroachment.

Need of the hour to do away with all sorts of encroachments, the apex court's cent re-ruling must be enforced by our custodians of law in letter and spirit!

K Ramadoss, Ayanavaram

I live on Greams lane. The portion of the sidewalk has been encroached upon and a water pumping station has been built by Apollo hospitals to enable their water tankers to pump and send water to the hospital.

The pumping station is located at the entrance if Greams lane and the hospital at the end of Greams lane.

The hospital administration in violation of orders of the honourable High court of Madras has blocked a portion of the road as reserved parking space for their water tankers. ​

Mohammed Mubeen, Greams Lane

I live in Anna Nagar, Y. Block Main Street. This is right opposite Tower Park rear gate near the Ayyapan temple. Opposite my flats you will find an entire stretch of pathway that is meant for people to walk is unauthorisedly occupied by the builders. Only 40% of the road in this stretch is open for vehicles and pedestrians. If any action is initiated it will be of great relief to road users who are mostly elders and school children.

Ashokkumar, Anna Nagar

I just want to bring to your notice about few neighbours who had done the same where am residing currently.

Long story short - our street is 10 feet wide. Just a bike or cycle can go at a time, not even an auto o Car can take a ride now. That's due to more parking in addition to road block.

We have taken many actions to get this issue addressed by Corporation of Chennai. My brother has submitted 5 letters so far to COC but no action has been taken yet.

Location of the sidewalk: Vallalar Street, MGR Nagar, Chennai - 600078.

Action required: We request Government/COC to take action and clear these hurdles. So that this street would get maximum usage by public and they don't required to turn around and look for other street to walk/ride.

Hoping that, at least now this issue will get addressed.

Logeswaran A , MGR Nagar

The location I am citing is South Mada Street in Mylapore and it is opposite Vasantha Bhavan Hotel.

The place is meant for small vehicles parking but all the area is encroached by the parking of vehicles and the whole of the pavement is beyond the usage of the public.

Besides the vehicles, vendors cart are dumped there and it is virtually an area with no space on the pavement.

If a car is parked at least one will have space to squeeze past it but if seven or eight big Tempo Travellers are parked where can one walk?

I wish the mission of The Hindu does something to mitigate this issue.

Solution: The area should be made a two-wheeler parking zone, because there is a better parking facility in North Mada Street. Parallel parking should be discouraged. No vehicles should be allowed to park for more than three hours as the travel operator permanently use that as a parking zone day and night.

Sad thing is when the parking for a travel van is Rs. 15 in North Mada street (handled by COC)the same here at South Mada is just Rs. 5. The travel operator with the nexus of the parking attendant do not insist for the pavement (this is handled by TEXCO).

Seshadri Baskar, Mylapore

I have been a resident of Chennai since 1997. During these years I have observed how the footpaths are usurped, occupied and destroyed all under the watchful eye of the authorities. They are not turning a blind eye, they simply either choose to ignore it or profit from it or even encourage it.

It is not just the commercial areas like T Nagar or Mount Road that are afflicted by this problem. Even residential areas like Kotturpuram and Adyar are victims as well.

In Kotturpuram, what ever little is left of the footpaths is occupied by auto stand associations, the laundry carts, the cycle repair shops and the mobile tailors. Surprisingly they all flaunt Municipality permit numbers to run their business. And then cars are parked on both sides of the street (4th Main road/Lock Street) which barely leaves enough space for one car to pass through at a time, leave alone pedestrians. There are quite a few retired/aged couples living in that area. I see them struggle to even take a simple evening walk.

On Sardar Patel road in Adyar, opposite to Currimbhoys, under the flyover, an auto repair workshop has opened up. There is oil and grease all over the road. What is supposed to be a parking area is now occupied by this shop. There is a traffic constable in hardly 50 mts from that place but this shop flourishes nevertheless.

On LB road the stretch from Mercy electronics to Murugan store is occupied by fruit vendors and vegetable vendors. 5 years ago there was nothing and the footpath was a clean stretch. Now you can barely walk there.

On Gandhi Mandapam road the footpaths used to be nice and clean; now I see fruit vendors, tender coconut vendors, and sugarcane juice vendors slowly occupying spots. It is only a matter of time before it becomes a mess like Adyar or T Nagar. The moment shops open up people stop and park to visit these shops leading to traffic problems as well.

In my opinion it is not a random occupation of a spot, it is an organized business run by the local henchmen who allot this spots, collect rents and share the proceeds with authorities who in turn ignore the problem. Because with out the participation and blessings of these people in positions of power, no one can dare to even place a blade of grass on the footpath.

We need a clean administration, and then not only the footpaths but the entire city will be clean. I appreciate the initiative taken by The Hindu. I hope the authorities see some sense and act on these concerns.

Srinivas Lingam

It is a matter of right to go in for pavements, pathways etc as we are in a metropolis. I am penning my suggestions as below.

1. We can start with pathways on the main arterial roads, which can facilitate children and slow moving population.

2. Next, we can have service lanes adjacent to main roads to facilitate cyclists and two-wheelers.

Ravi Shankar, Indira Nagar

I wholeheartedly welcome the initiative taken by The Hindu regarding the issue of the abysmal condition of the footpaths in Chennai. Sure, it is better to light a candle, instead of cursing the darkness.

I am from Adyar where there is hardly any foot path worth its name. The suffering and woes of the Adyarites especially the elderly, physically challenged and children is indescribable.

Presently, huge work is going on foot paths in Gandhi Nagar, where the existing footpath kerb stones have been dug up causing great inconvenience and safety hazards for the pedestrians. These are being replaced by granite kerb stones evidently at huge expense of tax payer’s money but the purpose of which is a puzzle to the Adyarites because none of the below problems seem to be getting addressed in the process.

The problems with the existing foot paths are as follows:

1. Nonexistent platforms forcing people to walk on the road perilously close to the vehicle traffic (Sardar Patel road itself is an example)

2. Very narrow width making the footpath practically unusable

3. Electrical panels fully obstructing the foot path

4. Much higher height of the kerb stones making it difficult if not impossible to climb on to the footpaths

5. Dug up tiles, pot holes on the platform

6. Car ramps projecting out of shops and houses encroaching on to the platforms

7. Encroachments by shops, compound walls into the platform

I am sending the details of encroachment of pedestrian space by the Modern Senior Secondary school Nanganallur located in AGS Colony.

Location of Sidewalk: V Street, AGS Colony, Nanganallur.

Description of issue: Due to insufficient space to park all the two wheelers of teachers and students inside the school premises, the entire side walk on the southern side of the V Street has been usurped by the school to park such vehicles inconveniencing the residents of the street who are mostly senior citizens.

Action Required: School Management should be forced to build adequate infrastructure for Vehicle parking inside their premises as per the norms prescribed by CMDA for a Higher Secondary School functioning in a residential area.

A letter dated 07/07/11, sent to the Corporation Commissioner by Shetdass Engineers P Ltd. The bunk in question is still functioning from the same location.

Sir,

This is to bring to your kind notice that there is an encroachment since 27/06/2011 in form of setting up a temporary bunk, occupying pavement, causing great hindrance to the pedestrians who are prevented from free usage of the pavement. Apart from this, the bunk has effectively started selling Tea, snacks, etc On account of this we noticed a large number of people in front of the bunk parking their two wheelers and four wheelers on the road. This causes great hardship to the pedestrians.

The huge crowd so gathered at the bunk throws and scatter the remnants around the area, which causes furthermore nuisance due to the area becoming very much untidy and also obviously, it’s a health hazard.

Besides we would also like to point out that Nelson Manickam Road is already crowded and has become congested by reason of overflow of traffic causing frequent accidents.

There is already a divider and a ‘U’ turn in front which further aggravates the problems and other inconveniences resulting in traffic jam in peak hours. Now the pedestrians are forced to walk on the centre of the road itself due to the above encroachment, as a result of which the people are prone to possible accidents. The traffic snarl, over crowding and accidents are becoming more and more a day to day affair due to the above encroachment.

Earlier a similar bunk that encroached the pavement was evicted by corporation promptly some 5 to 6 years back. Now the situation has become worsened and long before it becomes grave on account of the above encroachment, we sincerely request your good office to initiate immediate action to clear the encroachment in the interest of the safe use of the pavement.

We have already lodged a complaint in writing to the Zonal Manager Vth Division of Corporation, a copy of which is enclosed for your kind perusal and action.

We sincerely hope that your good office will evict the bunk thereby solving the problems put forth by the placement of the bunk.

S. Ravi, Sr. Manager, Shetdass Engineers P Ltd

Every time a new public utility problem is addressed we always tend to cite T Nagar and Mylapore. But here at North Chennai, Villivakkam North and Red Hills roads pedestrians do not have an inch of space to move. There are 4 TASMAC shops with in a kilometre radius and many encroachers on the left of north Red Hills road while moving towards Villivakkam railway station. The plight of pedestrians is horrible. Kindly address our area too.

After the Passport Seva Kendra was opened on Arcot Road, Saligramam near Bhanumathi Ramakrishna Road, the already choking footpaths had to accommodate numerous photocopy shops and notaries. To the left up to Big Bazaar, there is no footpath and to the right, up to 80 Feet Road, the footpath is in a pathetic condition and inaccessible at many places with even an auto stand at Jain Swarna Mahal on the footpath.

Hop, step and jump. That is what you have to do if you have to have a feel of the footpath in our locality, Kodambakkam. Residents and businessmen alike have taken it for granted to use this extra space the way like for their personal use, be it a garage, garden, godown, construction of humps extending to a major portion of the road for entry of vehicles, dumping waste, parking, defecation, hotels, etc. Corporation support comes in the form of costly garbage collection enclosures which have become public toilets and no one can go nearby (eg. United India Colony III and V Streets). Telephone junction boxes are frequently used for public ’convenience’ and for sticking of posters. The so-called improved drainage work in Anna Road has left the road and footpath so bad. Every year most of the footpaths are re-laid, leaving many portions occupied, dirty, around the telephone boxes etc. untouched but in many places so close to the trees. What is astonishing is that this relaying is done at places where it is actually not required. This is done only to break it again for planting mostly drumstick trees and flowering plants (UI Colony V Street). There is a colony of rag pickers living on the footpath at the beginning of Anna Road and around the Circular Park. The condition of the inner and outer circular roads around the park has to be seen to be believed. I have been reporting to the Corporation ‘on line' and some action is taken in most cases. But why is a perfect and permanent solution not forthcoming? Spoiling the road and footpath has to be made punishable and the residents have to change their mindset to bring about a proper change.

While we talk of footpath, we also need to mention about the roads, which are casually topped and patch worked. All the adjacent buildings are waterlogged and they do anything possible to avoid this. What is required is to remove few top layers of the road, recycle it and properly relay with proper gradient and provision to avoid water logging. This suggestion was implemented in front of US Consulate and Periyar Road and these roads are intact for more than two years. Similarly, concrete roads near Valluvar Kottam are a marvel as such. On the other hand, there is concrete road around the Circular Park in United India Colony, Kodambakkam. Here a number of vehicles are parked all over in this area, including imported cars, for months, covered with dust and rust and also with flat tyres. At least some of them may be discarded.

Location of the sidewalk: V.M Street and Balaji Nagar, Royapettah

Description of the issue: Localities such as V.M Street or Balaji Nagar in Royapettah have never witnessed proper pavements. As more people use the space meant for pavements, parking for instance, there is hindrance for smooth driving as well.

Actions required: Sand, stones and plastic trash for walkable pavements and breathable environment have to be cleared. Frequent checking by the CTP can avoid random parking of vehicles for long hours on the roadside.

Preethi Swaminathan, Royapettah

A coffee shop is exactly in the intersection of Cenotaph Road and Cenotaph 1st Street in Teynampet. His customers are parking their vehicles in the road and affecting the traffic flow. Since the walkway is blocked by a concrete table, there is no space for the pedestrian to use the walkway. Any help from The Hindu to remove the shop permanently from the road side would be greatly appreciated.

V. Sivakumar, Teynampet

There are many problems faced daily by the students and public of Chromepet at Rajendra Prasad Road, Nehru Nagar. The fruit vendor with the cart right on the foot path in front of the NSN School (main) should be relocated at least during the starting and closing time of the school and also the parking of vehicles and shopkeepers occupying the foot path has to be stopped to improve the safety of the public who walk on that road. Rajendra Prasad Road is very busy as busses ply frequently and so many students use that road to reach the school.

Chitra B, Chitlapakkam

I am residing in 25th Cross Street, Besant Nagar and the condition of a manhole in front of my house (centre of the road) is pathetic. I made a call to Corporation of Chennai by dialing 1913 and registered my complaint vide reference 434KCP in April 2013. In spite of repeated follow ups, the manhole has not been replaced and is posing danger to people walking on the road. I called up today to check the status and I received a text message saying, ""Your complaint on covering of man holes of SWD is completed"". It seems that Corporation is waiting for some calamity to happen after which they might replace it. It is quite a pathetic situation and we are not sure when this will get broken.

V. Srinivasan, Besant Nagar

The pavement opposite to the District Library at the Malar Hospital end was damaged by a JCB from Chennai Corporation while removing garbage one year ago. Some building waste has been dumped next to it. Now, people have recently started using this point to take a pee.

This stretch of road was once quiet, but now with four schools and one college on this road, thousands of students use it every morning and afternoon. They have to walk on the road, dodging cars and vans. Next to this, always parked, is a set of tractor-mixer presumably from the Corporation, making the space even narrower. One can just not walk even on the road, let alone the pavement.

Right at the junction of 1st Main road, Gandhi Nagar and Sardar Patel Road (one of the busiest roads in South Chennai) before the Madhya Kailash Bridge, some digging was done six months back. This has left a space of 10m x 10m where no vehicle or person can venture. This is right in front of the Cancer Hospital, where many patients wait to see doctors. There has been absolutely no response to our requests to fill the space up. Hundreds of cars and two wheelers have to go around this, and face traffic head-on. Irony is, traffic police are about 10 meters from this spot!

K V Seshasayee, Gandhi Nagar, Adyar

We, the residents of 7th Main Road, R. A. Puram, for more than a year now, have been stripped of our right to walk on one side of the above-mentioned road, thanks to the slipshod work undertaken by the Corporation authorities (or their contractors) of laying out the drainage system.

The detritus of their aborted handiwork is a grim reminder of the Corporation's helplessness and apathy; several phone calls and visits to their office at 31, C P Ramaswamy Road have been in vain.

When the excavation work was on, a street lamp was uprooted and it is yet to be replaced despite several reminders to the street lighting department. The lamp post was abutting a Corporation Community Hall, which has since been demolished. It was located opposite Old Door No. 24 (new no. 8).

The small TNEB junction box at this very spot is precariously perched and the tangle of wires and cables indicate the lack of co-ordination amongst the Public Utility Departments who are expected to work in unison! On many occasions we have seen sparks emanating from the rusted ramshackle junction box during spells of rain. The TNEB technicians need to be congratulated for being able to restore a semblance of normalcy amidst this mélange of cable, rubble and discarded cobblestones.

The following measures need to be adopted to bring back the road to its original look:

- Sidewalk to be redone

- Detritus to be removed

- Electrical Junction Box to be replaced and well entrenched before the onset of the North-East Monsoon.

- Storm-water drain outlet not properly finished (left undone till now).

- Street Lamp-post to be re-installed.

V. Kalidas, R. A. Puram

The condition of Kalakshetra Road (from L B Road side) is in shambles. This road was well laid when the Vice President of India visited Kalashetra Foundation a few months back. But after Chennai Corporation took up work for constructing the storm water drain, the condition has become awful. It has been over two months since the work was completed, but nothing has been done to repair the pathetic condition of the road.

Adding to fuel to fire, a trader, dealing in construction materials, has almost usurped the road. Building materials and supply vehicles have occupied the limited footpath the road has to offer. Not that the civic authorities are not aware of this, but they simply do not want to take any action because their interest, on a regular basis, is taken care by this trader.

In the on going campaign ‘My Chennai, My Right’, you came out with how one can access the documents or rather the various registers as a prelude to resurrect the city’s footpaths. While the information provided seem quite useful, can one so easily get the required register from the Chennai Corporation? My own personal experience suggests that even the Right to Information route does not impact the departments.

On April 20, 2013, I wrote a letter to the Commissioner, Chennai Corporation, seeking certain details under the Right to Information Act. The letter was sent in the required format (as per the Act) by duly affixing the court fee stamp of Rs.10. Since I did not receive any communication even after the lapse of the mandatory 30 days, I wrote a letter to the Tamil Nadu Information Commission, on June 3 seeking their help. Even the Commission has not replied to my letter to this date (July 3). It would seem that the Right to Information is slowly turning to Right to Ignore.

V.S. Jayaraman, T. Nagar

It is good that The Hindu has come out with this campaign in support of pedestrians. Many cars and two wheelers can be seen parked on available pavements, disregarding the pedestrians. I am a senior citizen. Once when traffic was held up on Arcot Road, bikes used up the available space on the pavement. When I asked one of them to give way, he said that at my age I should be staying at home and not be walking on the roads. The rider and the person on the pillion started laughing. It is survival of the fittest. Hopefully, the Right to Walk campaign will succeed and pavements will be available to pedestrians.

R Ganesh, Kodambakkam

The pavement in front of our road (13th Cross Street, touching 2nd Avenue, Besant Nagar) is dug up and is in such shambles with tiles piled up. The residents of the block of flats on the street (average age 70+) are imprisoned in the house and cannot get down onto the main rd. Please help us by pressurising the corporation to fix the tiles.

Dr. Sunanda Ghosh, Besant Nagar

I am highlighting two issues below.

1. Pavement encroached by a restaurant adjacent to the Police Station in Kotturpuram (in front of Anna Centenary Library). In fact, the encroachment happened in front of the police, less than a year ago.

2. A storm water drain in Velachery was constructed along the 100 ft bypass road, near the Vijayanagar bus stand, where many shops have encroached the land and are using the open drain as their garbage disposal ground. There are no platforms on both sides of the road which has a TASMAC outlet in the corner which creates lot of nuisance to children and women.

Hope your initiative will bring in some change in the mindset of general public as well as the administration.

P.T. Seshadri, Pallikaranai

I am 82 years and live on Barnaby Road and due to uneven and badly maintained footpaths I’m forced to remain at home. I only like to go to the temple and to the bank, which is a few blocks away. Either the footpath is occupied by tea shops or coconut vendors or puncture shops. One is forced to share the roads with buses and fast moving traffic. My suggestion is to have footpaths, which are wide enough to accommodate three people so that it is enough for people to walk and not giving room to these shops. There are also people urinating on the compound walls.

Shivchand N. Vora, Kilpauk

There are so many places in T. Nagar without footpaths or are encroached upon, if available. Old people like me find it life threatening to walk on T. Nagar’s streets. One such place is the platform opposite to a firewood shop near the junction of Dhandapani Street and Venkatanarayana Road. This encroachment has been going on for five decades. I used to lodge a complaint with the traffic police in Pondy Bazaar and saw to it that he was booked and punished a number of times. He stays away from using the platform for some time and then starts again.

Natesan, T. Nagar

I live in one of the by lanes of Triplicane High Road. The stretch of footpath between Rathna Cafe and The Grand Sweets restaurant faces the same ordeal as any other pavement in our city. It is broken on many places and has even disappeared in some as the shopkeepers have extended their boundaries and built footsteps, slopes etc. The vehicles are parked leaving little gap to reach the pavement. Added to these is the presence of drunken men, thanks to a TASMAC outlet located here. The footpath is a virtual picnic spot for these men to sprawl about, to enjoy their drinks and to indulge in noisy drunken brawl. Whatever little place available on the footpath is littered with plastic sachets. Hope we get redemption soon.

T.R. Maragatham, Triplicane

The Corporation of Chennai accepts telephonic complaints at their contact number 1913. This cell is manned by very polite staff and they immediately send an acknowledgement of the complaint via SMS to the consumer. Another SMS is received within a couple of hours, confirming that the complaint has been attended to, which is not true. I have used this number a couple of times to report non removal of debris left behind after a new pavement was installed on Ramakrishna Street, T.Nagar, but till date, no action has been taken, though I received confirmation of the same via SMS.

Another frustrating issue is that conservancy staff refuse to lift the debris and demand payment for the same from the apartment owners, even though the debris is left behind by the contractors who laid the new pavements.

What recourse does the tax paying consumer have for such errant behaviour on the part of the corporation?

U. Pillai, T.Nagar

July 4

The area I am referring to is in Ambattur, specifically 1st Cross Main Road, off 3rd Main Road. What we had before all of the infrastructure work began was two open top ditches about three feet wide on either side of the road. Now the authorities decide to widen one side, spend tax payers money, and have a ditch that collects rainwater and is a breeding ground for mosquitoes.

All we had to do, is put a concrete drain pipe in place, close it up, and provide a sidewalk for the people who use this road. But now we have a road that is less wide than what we had before, and the pedestrians have to share the same road with vehicles, inhaling the dust as they trudge their way to work.

We would appreciate if this matter is looked in to further. Thanks in advance.

Ravi, Ambattur

Many cases have been filed to clear the platform in Pondy Bazaar occupied by the shop keepers. Right to use the platform by the pedestrians is heavily affected. Moreover, tiny shops selling keychains and hairclips are occupying the entrance of the shops or near the beginning of staircases. In spite of a building constructed for these people in the same area, the shopkeepers have not shifted to this building. As customers, frequently visiting Pondy Bazaar, we would like to know the reasons for not occupying the building and why the authorities are accountable for not implementing the eviction.

Balambal Ramakrishnan, T Nagar

I would like to bring to your attention Luz Corner in Mylapore. This is on the junction of Royapettah High Road - Luz Church Road. Here, the hawkers have not only obstructed the pavements but have also occupied Royapettah High Road. While trying to photograph these, I was opposed by the hawkers and they tried to man handle me.

It is difficult to understand how the Corporation of Chennai and the police department have allowed this and refuse to take any action. Royapettah High Road is one-way due to lack of space, and the hawkers have merrily occupied the road on both sides and have reduced the road width by at least 10 ft right on Luz signal.

My humble suggestion would be to make some right person act by removing such encroachments at least near the signal.

Ravichandran, Mylapore

There is always a police van and a booth at the junction of Usman Road-Duraiswamy Road opposite Pothys. The hawkers outside Pothys, the autos and share taxis occupy the space adjacent to Nallis blocking movement of traffic.

A few months back around 7 pm I was walking from Ramanathan Street towards Ranganthan street. I saw the vendors below the flyover packing and running with their wares. Two lady constables were walking and warning them about the visit of a police officer. About 30 ft behind them walked a police officer accompanied by a few aides. He walked till the middle of the flyover and turned back. And behind him walked the lady constables giving the all clear signal to hawkers.

I have seen many states and to me it appears that the police in T. Nagar is the most corrupt and I see no improvement in this part of the city. The day is not far off when one of the buildings will collapse on this road/Ranganathan street and thousands will die and many more die due to stampede and shock.

Ramesh V., T. Nagar

A clear example of the apathy of the enforcing authorities and the helplessness of pedestrians can be experienced if one takes a walk from the west end of Nageswaran Road through Pothys to Duraiswamy subway in the evenings.

Ten tears back one could do it in 5-6 minutes. Now it will take 20 to 30 minutes because all the traders have occupied the road making it extremely impossible for walkers to alternate between slope levels and raised platforms. Vendors have taken over permanently near Pothys and it is like walking through a cage while the rest of the pathway is taken over by traders and hawkers.

On Duraiswamy Road some famous shops have taken over about 8 feet of the pathway and an astounding concrete ramp put up by a store has made it impossible for people to walk here. Add to this the lawless white minivans and autos who occupy the kerb for the whole stretch of Duraiswamy Road.

Nearer the subway any no. of eateries and punture shops and vendors have virtually made life impossible for walkers. Unless huge penalties are awarded on lawbreakers by enforcing authorities, T. Nagar will become a Ranganathan.

V.S. Gopalarathnam, T. Nagar

The Corporation, after admitting that there are commercial establishments encroaching on public space, cannot shirk their responsibility with respect to enforcement. They do not have to police every establishment. A Public Notice calling upon all commercial establishments to refrain from encroaching on public spaces with a 15 day period for corrective action by the establishment would be the first step. A levy of a fine of Rs. 1000 for every square foot per day would be the next step. Strict enforcement of the second step is the deterrent. Then as the unnamed corporation official has asked ‘for citizens to do their bit’, the common man can bring to the notice of the enforcing officials the erring establishments. Political will for enforcement of the need of the hour.

Sheila Jayaprakash, Mogappair

Considering the way our footpaths are also shows the proclivity of our people to use the road rather than the footpath. The first step maybe to start walking on the right hand side of the road rather than the left side. This way the pedestrian would have the oncoming vehicle in their sight most times.

Sajith Kandeth, Perungudi

Thanks for your effort in campaigning on the misuse of footpath.

I would like to bring it to your notice that Kovai Pazhamudir Nilayam in Shanthi Colony, Anna Nagar, is abusing not only the footpath (by extending his sales activity) but also the adjacent road for their exclusive customer parking by deploying 1 parking attendant.

It's not that no one has brought this to the notice of K-4 Police, but there has been no action.

I happened to check with one local weekly tabloid, it was to my surprise I was told that this shop is having high level lobby and hence even after publishing in that weekly also didn't fetch any result.

On the other hand, the traffic police give a hard time to patients visiting Sundaram Medical Foundation just for parking two wheeler adjacent to road, which does not even contribute to road traffic.

Om Prakash, Anna Nagar

Chennai has become very crowded and pedastrians are taken for a ride in this historic city. Regulatory authorities should focus on the issues since it is on the increase now.

Pavements and platforms have become a thing of the past. The reason for this is the large scale encroachments by the shop keepers all over the city of Chennai. There is no proper regulation by the traffic authorities to help the pedestrians who find it difficult to walk on the roads. Traffic is becoming too heavy and we see a lot of vehicles on the road thanks to the policy of the banks granting vehicle loans very generously. Recently one of my friends was at a shop purchsing a bread. An automan was reversing and hit my friend for no fault of his in the tiny TMM St in Vnananthurai near Besant Nagar.This is one of the many instances in the area in which the pedestrains are hit by the vehicles and we started enduring the same since we are not able to cure the same.We appealed to the authorities in vain lot of times!.Govt and the concerned officials should sit together to find a solution immediately!

Vannanthurai has become too busy and TMM ST is becoming a dumping yard to say the least.Right in the middle of hte road some abondoned tricycles are dumped.Just opposite to that htere is an open EB Junction Box posing danger.During rains it becomes miserable mainly for the Senior Citizens since the traffic is too heavy and one do not get any leg space!

S.Venugopalan, Vannanthurai

It is true that our pavements in this city are non existent. Where they do exist, they are totally unusable due to various factors which I do not need to dwell on. Everyone knows it and everyone sees it. Everyday. One important aspect that is not being addressed when it comes to pedestrian convenience is the traffic flow pattern.

Let us assume we have decent enough pavements for people to walk on. But with continuous traffic flowing on one way roads like College Road, Haddows Road, Nungambakkam High Road and many other roads in the city, one cannot cross any of these roads at any point. The ‘free left turn’ also adds to the problem in a similar way. Looks like the one way system has been introduced mainly to ease the problem of the traffic police. Besides, our drivers do not have the patience to wait at a traffic light even for a mere sixty seconds. Without traffic stopping how can people cross a road? If we expect people to use pavements, then we should also expect them to cross the road at some point. In busy places like Manhattan in New York City and other places, traffic lights exist at the end of every block and the traffic obeys them. This why it is so easy to be a pedestrian in that city. And of course, the pavements are very walkable. And this is true in most of the ‘developed’ world. If we are to improve amenities for pedestrians here, this is one aspect we must address.

Another point I would like to bring up is the ramps we often find at gates of all new constructions. These project well into the public place which is actually meant for the pedestrian. This happens because the plot owner has raised the level of his plot often to monstrous heights. The blame for this must entirely fall on the civic authorities. Each time they re lay the roads, they increase its level by quite a few inches. Subsequently many of the old houses and bungalows – on Harrington Road , for example – suffer. The road level, over the years, has gone up way above their plots and each time it rains, their compound is flooded with water often entering the houses. There is nothing they can do other than break and reconstruct their houses with a higher plinth! The authorities had sometime ago announced that all future road repair work would be done removing a layer of the existing surface so that the final level does not go up. But what I have seen does not seem to be so. They callously keep adding layer upon layer to existing roads..This has to stop and the authorities have to be held accountable here.

And one more point. Most new commercial buildings and apartment blocks leave their entire roadside open so that cars can park directly from the road for the entire width of their property and the end of the cars often stick out beyond the boundary of the plot. This extra space is often ramped up on to the road thus pushing the pedestrians on to the carriage way.

With all the debate you have initiated and with people writing in every day with photographs of non existent pavements, please consider the above points as well. Enough pictures have now been provided by readers about the plight of pavements. Now what is the next step in trying to get these remedied? I notice we always highlight our problems but how do we ensure action is taken to set them right? You, our newspaper, have to lead us here

Ravi Kumar Nair, Kilpauk Garden Road

Way back in 2004, I wrote to The Hindu about vanishing foot paths and it was published in the Sound Off column. From 2004 to 2013 the scenario has completely changed and all those remaining footpaths of 2004 has completely gone extinct. Now almost all of us in this city who are to walk for any reason and in any season are adept to walk with fear and terror each time we walk along a road. The problem is much worse in areas like ECR where costly sedans are gliding past at 70 – 80 km speed just missing your shoulder because you have artistically bent to avoid being hit by that car. Imagine the woe of those who have to cross the road at any given point in E|CR road. To feel the life time experience of escaping death and feeling the exhilarating victory of having crossed the road , I invite my fellow city –zens to come and cross the road at ECR between Thiruvanmiyur and Injampakkam.

Whenever we send our kids to the road side shop that require a road crossing we used to wait for their return with agonising hearts , such is the condition of our roads which do not have a foot path or does not allow anybody to cross it. What a wonderful development to cherish in our democratic nuclear powered country.

I Used to watch the VIP convoys that frequents the ECR road. With great speed and in a group of around 20 vehicles our top citizens are literally flying in this road. Leave alone VIP s but all the high officials and elite of the society are always traveling in a speeding chauffeur driven vehicle. They never know the feel of the road and the perils of absence of foot paths or the near impossible road crossings. But unfortunately they are the one who governs , runs and plan this city of poor struggling pedestrians. Let the high officials , politicians, and VIPs at least try to take a walk on any road in this city on a working day to find out what is the real problem. If they are not going to step out of their cars and convoys, then all our efforts to bring to notice the dangers of the roads are going to be farcical

The people are running marathons for social cause, likewise we have to organise Chennai walk by including celebrities in disguise and the event should be kept secret. It should be a casual walk where no police escort to be given so that those who are oblivious to this no foot path problem will at least come to know the deplorable conditions of our city and its poor pedestrians.

After our independence how many more struggles are we going to undertake? The right to walk, the right for a safe road crossing , the right for safe potable water at our dry corporation tabs, the right for metered autos, the list will be endless , that too all these are very fundamental and essential for day to day life. How on earth with so many malfunctioning and non-existing facilities Chennai plots and flats are being sold for crores of Rupees. A mind boggling question.

J. Danabal, Kottivakam

While citizens are fighting for walking space in crowded residential and commercial areas, the Chennai Corporation is re-laying the foot path in Kasturi Ranga Road, full of big bungalows and hardly any pedestrians. Part of this foot path is already encroached with garden by the residents

G.S. Vijayaraghavan, Ambattur

I think in the first phase of this campaign, you are covering the core city and have not yet touched the suburbs like our area, Medavakkam. Our area is a one which is experiencing exploding expansions on all sides, but the pedestrians are forgotten as usual. For instance, you may cover the Mambakkam and Perumbakkam signal areas in Medavakkam Bazaar area and it will amply show you how the pedestrians are struggling even to move one feet ahead. Worst is the situation of crossing the roads in the above said places. Foot over bridge is the immediate need of the hour in these two junctions and also at Medavakkam Cross Road. Such bridges are built in some areas but never used. But here people will thank all, if such bridges are constructed.

V. Raman, Medavakkam

My application for road register went in vain . I am waiting for it for the past 2 and a half years. After appealing to Appellate finally i had approached the STATE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER also .

In the mean time, out of 10 houses in a row, 6 got enchroached . My Complaints to all officials went in vain. The increase in land value is making people craze for enchroaching.

We are neglected from receiving any records through RTI if it is not favourable.Once my neighbour threatened me that i will be facing consequences. This is how our life moves on if we oppose or air our views.

P.Geetha, Guindy

July 6

Location and description: The Velachery Vijayanagar junction is a nightmare. So many ILLEGAL ""porambokku"" shops selling biriyani,waste paper etc have occupied that junction causing massive traffic bottlenecks.

People are forced to walk on the road in the junction because of the TASMAC shop and other illegal shops causing massive traffic jams.

Action required: Demolish all the illegal shops in the junction and make way for pedestrians.

Srini Swaminathan

At Taylors Road, Appa Garden Road and smaller streets around them in Kilpauk.

Although this is still a predominantly residential area, with half a dozen schools in a 1km radius, pedestrians are forced to walk on the road.

Where once there were wide, low and accessible pavements, now there are none or pavements that are impossible to use because they are too high, broken down, blocked (by transformers, shops or parked cars) or taken over for other uses.

Taylors Road and Halls Road have become major link roads to Anna Nagar. Traffic is heavy at most times of day. There is no traffic management. There are no pedestrian crossings. We (I am 76 years old) just take our chances by diving into traffic or walking through it.

There is a proposed metro station that would in principle be walking distance for this area, but getting there will mean walking on busy roads and crossing streets where traffic never stops.

What this area needs are clear continuous pavements of a height that is usable by the elderly. It needs pedestrian crossings. It desperately needs properly managed traffic.

Kusum Mody

Location of the Sidewalk : Bazullah Road (Near North Usman Road, Vivek & Co Signal),

Description of the Issue: The platform has been completed encroached upon and fenced for putting up a pavement park by a builder forcing the pedestrians to walk on the road endangering their life in one of the busiest road. We request the authorities to act and clear the pavement for pedestrians use.

S.Muralidharan

Location of sidewalk: Sterling road, Nungambakkam along the Sri Lankan High commission

Issue: As if the absence of traffic lights at the junction of sterling road near Loyola college was not enough, the Sri Lankan embassy has encroached upon the platform right from the stretch opposite Krishnaswamy matric school up to the embassy and a little beyond, by putting up barbed wire, barricades and security guard enclosures, forcing pedestrians to use the carriageway. Even at the opposite side of the road, barricades have encroached on the pavement. Is this the price the common man has to pay for the safety of the High Commissioner? In this case, the encroacher is not ""public"" but the government itself. Can this be changed?

Congratulations on initiating the compaign which in my opinion is yielding results. Great Show. This compaign is an eye opener and the success depends on the cooperation and the willingness of the people in corporation and government. Corporation has great responsibility to the citizens of Chennai.

Let me talk about K.K. Nagar. K.K. Nagar like Annanagar, is well planned with many trees all along the road and many of the roads are wide enough to cater to the growing population. But unfortunately the benefits of such roads are not felt by the citizens. For example the usage of 80 ft road is 40 ft only due to parking of vehicles on either side of roads by travel agents, eataries occupying entire footpath, garbage dumping on footpaths, small unauthorised worship places on the pavements etc.

The solution to these problems needs to be addressed immediately. In my opinion the following may regulate a bit and clean up the city

• Problems should be nipped at the bud, i.e when a travel agent parks one car in the begining, he should be fined and not allowed to function. Let me give an example of Saudi Arabia, where even the taxis are not allowed to wait anywhere to pick up passengers and there are specific places to park the taxis in the night. In Dubai vehicles can be parked at specific designated place on payment of fee.

• Installation of Cameras at strategic places and displaying that there is camera installed in the street which is being monitored. Immediate action should be taken when someone parks the vehicle or someone urinates or garbage is dumped.

• Contractors laying roads or laying cables or digging pits should be made to close the pits so that there are no gaping holes on the roads to cause accidents.

• Builders should not be allowed to construct houses if there are no parking spaces inside the flat.

• Eateries are health hazards which nipped at the bud will lead to healthy living

There are so many ways to mitigate such problems, which can be done by the government. Finally where there is a will there is a way.

The initiative taken by The Hindu is a begining in the right direction and will be appreciated by the citizens of chennai over the years to come.

N. Suresh

Location of the sidewalk: Velachery 100 feet bye pass road (Near Velachery bus stand)

Description of the issue:

1. The side walk is not fully present along the stretch from the bus stand. Hence pedestrians have to walk on the road along with vehicles. Unfortunately the vehicles don’t accommodate space for us, hence we have to wait till the vehicles in front of us

2. The level of the foot path is not even and is up and down, especially between the entrances of shops and residential apartments. This makes it difficult for all senior citizens to get up and down each time while walking on it

3. Encroachment by shops along the path

4. Hoardings and electric posts are present in the middle of the path. Hence cannot be used in that stretch

5. Shop keepers using footpath as parking area

Action required:

1. The walk way is even along the whole stretch from the Bus stand itself as majority of the passengers head towards bye pass road from it

2. No obstacles in the middle

3. Prevent motor vehicles from using the footpath

Location of the pavement - Right on GST Road, at Thirumangalam Signal junction towards Koyambedu, Anna Nagar

Description of the issue and action required.

1) Foot path was removed 2 yrs ago - when Bridge construction wasn’t even started

2) The Storm water drain is effectively out of order - all paths to the now invisible drain is blocked!!

3) Water logging at its Worst.. People now walk on the Road in one of the worst Congested Areas in CHENNAI. People wait for buses on the road or on the dirty water

Point is – It’s not enough to warn residents about water logging and mosquito menace..How does the corporation plan to address the water logging problem right on their own roads!!!

Action Required - BARE Minimum is ensure the Water doesn’t get logged till the various Govt departments and contractors figure out when/how and by what means they will complete Thirumangalam Bridge , figure out the Metro construction at the junction, When and how they will prune/cut down the 35+ year old trees in the avenue to complete their grand plans.

I live in Srinagar Colony, Saidapet. It is a green, peaceful neighbourhood where footpaths exist but are largely unused as they are slippery and ill maintained. The walkers choose the roads themselves that are fortunately broad.

There is an implicit hierarchy on our Indian roads where the pedestrian falls at the lowest level. This contrasts sharply with the organized Western road scene where a pedestrian is duly rightfully privileged. Without digressing as to why there is this contrast, let me dwell on what is wrong with our own city roads when it comes to the man-on-foot’s safety and what needs change.

Ours is a developing society with ugly economic and social disparities. These extend to our roads – where the footpather is a nobody and the pondy-registered-imported-car-driver/owner is a somebody. There is a certain untold arrogance in the way our traffic operates. I once wondered why we have so many people jaywalking and risking their own lives as well as panicking the oncoming vehicles. I then realized there aren’t any (or a sufficient number of) zebra crossings in the first place. Even if there are, no one respects the green man on the traffic signal. I personally know of a young servant maid who died while crossing the road, at a pedestrian crossing where vehicles are known for NOT stopping when they should.

The same plight extends to the case of footpaths. While we look at broadening roads and creating / encroaching space for parking and driving vehicles, we don’t put as much thought to the common man on foot. It is a common sight to find footpaths taken, broken, moss-ridden. The many photos published in the Hindu just in the last few days stand proof of this fact. Only two entities can create a positive difference here – the Government and the common man himself. An awareness of the prevalent footpath-issues, a collective change in attitude for the better in view of respect for the human life (irrespective of which human!) and active measures to rebuild / revamp footpaths in each locality will go a long way in making the pedestrian’s life better. Let us walk the talk so we can walk the walk!

The unfinished construction of a canal through the 3rd avenue AnnaNagar (connecting Otteri nalla and Kuvum River) is an incessant misery to hundreds of people living here. We have one church and two temples on the road side. Hundreds of believers are suffering a lot to reach their worship place. There is no pavement at all. It is the one of the busiest places of the city. The place has become so isolated and unreachable due to the uncleared debris and disappeared pavement because of the construction. We want a sudden action from the road authority to finish the construction and to make the road functional.

The residents of First Cross, Kamaraj Street, West Gandhinagar, Avadi comes under Ward No 34 of Avadi Municipality. The streets in this area are already dug up for laying underground drainage pipes. But except for filling mud in the dug up area no any other repair works have been carried out to make it suitable for use by the residents and all are aware that the residents are not in a position to drive their vehicles in these streets.

States of these streets have worsened due to rain. After rain the streets have become pools of mixture of mud and silt though which people cannot even walk. Driving car or two wheelers is out of question. The situation is more critical in streets like first Cross, Kamaraj Street where there is no proper provision for drainage of wastage water coming out of the houses. Waste water is drained to the streets only by the residents due to lack of proper drainage system. During raining this waste water also mix with the mud and silt. At this stage the streets cannot be used by even pedestrians. The condition of school going children cannot be described. Moreover, accumulation of waste water and its stagnancy is very much unhygienic and breeding of mosquitoes may lead to spread of epidemic.

Moses Street is the only link street for the residents of Kamaraj Street First Cross to reach CTH road, but the condition of that street also become worst during rainy season. Many people have fallen down from their two wheelers due the worst condition of the street.

The situation becomes more critical and worrisome when people fall sick and are required to be taken to hospital. As vehicles cannot move on these streets, the only option will be to lift the patient by other person as is generally done in some very remote and hilly areas in Jammu and Kashmir or Himachal Pradesh. Such a situation in the sub urban location of the Metro City Chennai is definitely shameful, especially for those responsible authorities of the Municipality and elected leaders.

So, the residents of West Gandhinagar, Avadi humbly request the authorities to take necessary steps immediately to carry out repair of these badly affected streets and make the streets black top with proper drainage system. They would be ever grateful to the authorities for this act of kindness.

Location: Pavement at Brindavan Street, Mylapore, Chennai (off Royapettah High Road) outside the office of the Asst. Engineer, Corporation of Chennai

Issue: The pavement outside the office of the Assistant Engineer, Corporation of Chennai located at Brindavan Street, Mylapore has been encroached upom by hutments with full knowledge of Corporation officials since this is right outside the Assistant Engineer's office. Are Corporation officials endorsing encroachments? These hutments have been there for over a year.

Action required: Immediate removal of hutments and a departmental enquiry by senior officials into the same. Suitable action against concerned officials.

Sriram Balakrishnan

The footpath in front of Gayathri apartments has been used as storage for mineral water bottles for quite some time. Consequently, the footpath space in front has been constantly occupied by one or two mini-lorries for their transportation.

During rains, the water stagnates in front of the footpath right up to the center of the road. The pedestrians have to walk in the middle of the road to avoid stagnant water. As the storm water drains is located on the other side of the road, there is no way for the water to drain. Corporation should take action to rectify the situation before monsoon.

Ajit Renga

Description of the issue: Myself and my neighbours are eager to exercise the Right to Walk ! But, where is the path to walk Two months back, Metro Water authorities dug First and Third streets of Sector A, Anna Nagar West Extension, for laying pipes. We requested, cajoled, and asked the contractor who was undertaking the digging work to atleast close the dug up portion. He was very magnanimous enough to leave it as such. Frequent showers made the position worse. The street simply turned into a ploughed land. SBOA Matriculation is just a few yards away. These two streets are being used by the school children of these areas to walk through to reach the School. Many school children residing in these streets were unable to step down and walk and had to be absent from the school. One fine evening, we caught hold of the contractor who did the job and promised to remove the dug up sand. He vanished. Can the Civic authorities or Metro water authorities guide us on 'How to Walk' along the street ?

Action required: Slush/mud to be removed and make the streets worth enough to walk...

R.V. Baskaran

The Hindu has brought out several cases of encroachment on foot paths under the caption 'Right to walk'. Here is a case involving gobbling up of a whole 40 ft road.

After my retirement, I started living in my house built in 1989 inside an approved layout called the A.G.S Colony extension, Beach Layout, Kottivakkam. Mine was the lone house in this location at that time. As time passed, this area got infested with encroachments and the road in front of my house shrunk to less than 20 ft (as per the approved layout sized by Joint Director Town planning the road has to be 40 ft wide). The never cleared tons and tons of garbage piled up and shrunk the road further converted `it to a narrow foot path. The all powerful local Panchayat dominated by the nearby slum was ruling the roost at that time and my voice was never heard.

As the city expanded, the Corporation of Chennai took over the administration of this locality last year and thanks to their effort, the garbage heaps were cleared and the road became motorable but this advantage got nullified by the recent action of Metro Water Department who have recently installed a hand pump occupying a considerable area in the middle of the already shrunken road. This is an addition to a portable water tap a few feet away from the new one which is used for open air bathing, washing, including washing of fish carrying autos, creating pools of stagnant (mosquito breeding water). The old one was provided by the now defunct Panchayat for the benefit of the encroachers. I lodged my protests through registered letters to Commissioner (Chennai Corporation) and the local Assistant Engineer

Pending action on my representation, I approached the Metro Water Assistant Engineer, a young lady having her office in the Corporation office at Kottivakkam, who was totally nonchalant and even refused to see the approved layout blueprint that I carried with me, tempting me to doubt her integrity. To one it appears that she intends to extend the slum with its encroachments into the planned and approved layout of ours, as the already shrunken road is gradually tending to become non-existent.

I have served the Indian Air Force during 1954 to 1969 and have taken part in two major wars (the 1962 Chinese War and the 1965 Pakistan War).

The guns have fallen silent in the front, but for one who is very close to 80 years of age, the war continues, not with external enemies but with an internal enemy in the form of a Metro Water official who is bent on making my life miserable by creating the filthiest surroundings in front of my house by extending the slum into the approved layout.

Location of the sidewalk: Arcot Road, Near Vadapalani Busstand

Description: A senseless encroachment by two trolley shops, one puncture shop and a Tree temple on a already damaged and dis-continuous sidewalk along the Arcot Road between the busy vadapalani Bus stand and a famous private Hospital. It makes impossible for the pedestrians and the patients to walk along and making them to walk in middle of the busiest road as the pavement is entirely blocked.

Actions Required: I want the concerned officials to remove the encroachment and to help those shopkeepers for a profitable shifting of shops as those are their only mean of life.

Karthik P.S.

In many of the research studies based on the statistics, we see that most of the accidents involve pedestrians and safe continuous walkways are very much needed to cut down the numbers.

During our recent field visit last week, at several locations like T. Nagar, Thiruvotiyur Road and EVR Salai and few other locations our team hardly found any sidewalks, pedestrian facilities. And if there are any, they are encroached upon by vegetable vendors, some construction activities or are in a terrible shape.

In 2012 alone Thiruvattiyur had close to 100 pedestrian crashes, which is a very alarming number and we noticed that there are quite some schools in these areas. Peak hours are even more a nightmare. We noticed so many parents walk along with kids on carriage way which is highly unsafe and many of these corridors don't have a median as well which is making the situation even worse.

I sincerely appreciate your work regarding this, and hope to see some beneficial changes for the pedestrians happening some time soon.

Dr. Naga Swetha Pasupuleti

Location: Nolambur (Near Schram's Academy School)

Description of the Issue: The small stretch of road that leads to the Schram's Academy School at Nolambur is filled with potholes and no tarmac for a larger part of the road. While having a side walk will be boon for the children, am sure any one will accept that having a motorable road is a basic necessity for a place which is frequented by hundreds of Parents and Children to the school. I always wonder when our Civic authorities will learn to prioritize in spending the tax payer's money. While they spend huge money in laying good roads leading to the houses of affluent people which are frequented less (sometimes none) by common public, they overlook the quality of roads leading to such public institutions frequented by many people every day.

Venkataramanaiah R.

Location of the pavement - Peters Road adjacent to Nokia Care, near fly over intersection connecting Peters Road and Conran smith Road.

Description of the issue and action required – There is no defined pedestrian walkway here in Peters Road. Very frequently, storm water drain gets blocked in this stretch and the sludge is dumped outside without removal. Over 5 feet of the actual footpath is occupied for dustbin forcing the pedestrian to walk towards the road. Also, most of the occasion during daytime, cars are parked and forcing the pedestrians to the dangers of bigger vehicles, especially bus.

Action required – Creation of footpath without hindrance from dumping of storm water sludge and parking of cars.

Location: Pavement infront of IMPCOPS office( Between Adayar and Thiruvanmiyur)

Issue: The following pavement infront of IMP COPS Office (located between adayar depot and Thiruvanmiyur Signal) is dumped with waste, sand and metal. It is difficult to use the sidewalk and one is forced to step on to the road. The rain make the scene much worse. Clearing the pavement will be helpful for the people using the sidewalk, as they wont have to step on to the road with a flowing traffic.

Mahesh S.P.

Location - Dr. Radhakrishnan Nagar Main Road, Thiruvanmiyur

Description of the issue: It is parallel to the LB Road. So vehicles including lorries carrying construction material, Aavin milk van, CoC compactor, school buses, cars, water-can carriers use this road to beat the signals on LB Road. There are traffic jams every morning and evening. There is a school on this road. Kids need to reach it safely. The only footpath is the storm water drain on one side that doubles as a walkway. The footpath is abused in every possible way. A new storm water drain is being built. The ""completed"" portions have wires running over them. Autos and cars are parked on the footpath. Construction material is stacked on them.

Barricades which were set up at 1 am to deafening noise for a visit by Jt. Commissioner Mr. Anand Kumar are already missing.

Action required: Stop re-construction of the storm water drain.

Have percolation pits/wells wherever water collects on the road.

Close the pits neatly, lay a neat footpath. Remove the slopes people have built into the road at 45 degree angles. Remove the mud on the road and see that water flows into the pits/wells without obstruction. Tell us whom we should contact when

[a] people park vehicles,

[b] dump stuff on the only footpath we have on this very busy road.

[c] start businesses in this primary residential area.

This is regarding the incomplete cleaning of rain water drains in our area. This is from Alamelumangapuram colony behind Sai Baba temple, Mylapore. After yesterday's (10th Jul 2013) rains, toady, some people claiming they are from corporation, came to our house and asked for money as they are going to clear the rain water drains. First, we could not ascertain if they are from corporation as our corporation workers do not wear any uniforms nor do they carry any ID cards. Secondly, a person claiming to be their supervisor was rude and said they are not responsible to anyone and we cannot ask them anything.

Next we requested them to carry the mud and slush taken out immediately as leaving it there will serve no purpose as they will again block the drains and in addition to that will come into the house with rain water as the road has been laid without milling and is higher than the house base level. For this, they said they will not do it and we are free to complain wherever we can. I have written this to bring to the notice of the concerned councilor and other corporation officials. This sort of rude behavior is not asked for by the tax paying public for whom the corporation works.

Leaving mud and slush without carrying them for days saying it is wet will only lead to blockages again and diseases in case of sewerage drains.

Recently, I have come across a very innovative encroachment in TNHB, Velachery.( MIG-Plots Nos:1331,1333, 1336).Pls find the attached photos. I am not sure, if we are using our innovative brains for the development of our country, or for the new invention of products which can help the farmers, but, I am sure, the innovative ideas the Chennaites generate in encroaching roads and public spaces by converting into mini gardens, car parks etc., beyond their compound walls, are unbelievable and mind boggling. It's not the question of space in their plots, they have constructed bungalows till the edge of their plots, that they could not find space to park their cars. Government should not be sleeping on these burning issues, otherwise, it will become common scene after few years.

G.E. Siluvaimani

Jagadambal Street in T Nagar behind Vani Mahal is absolutely waterlogged and the pavement is nonexistent or filled with plants leaving no space for pedestrians to walk. The road has been waterlogged every year for the past 10 years at least, during the rainy season, and only meager attempts have been made to rectify this situation. I had to almost hitch a ride with someone on a car or Bike because there was absolutely NO space to walk. It's about time the Government re-laid this road and made it to a slightly higher level. Not only is it a hindrance for the pedestrians, it's also extremely unhealthy for all the residents around the area.

Juhi Sharma

Location of side walk: Vadapalani-Outside Gulecha towers/Bata Shoe shop.Opp Forum Vijaya Mall

Description of the issue: The footpath is already crooked and irregular. The dustbin nearby usually overflows and the debris spills on to the footpath.The gap between the electric box and the wall provides space for people to relieve themselves publicly. On top of it, such places are corned for banners as seen. The logs have not been removed inconveniencing pedestrians.

Action required: Remove banner logs, re lay footpath and clear debris from behind the electric box.

Lavanya P.

Location: At the entry to Wheatcroft Road, a commonly used and prominent area in Nungambakkam.

Issue: The pavements are nearly nonexistent in this location, and there is a lot of discomfort caused by garbage bins, since people dump the waste everywhere but in the bins - but the clearance of the garbage by the Corporation vehicles is restricted only to the bins. This leaves behind a lot of garbage blowing about in the wind, and into the residential/ commercial buildings abutting this area. We have tried working with the Corporation Officials - but to no use.

The Kalamegam Salai in Mugappair West has two temples and a school and has already been dug up a lot for laying of metro water pipes and drainage pipes. The road is in shambles as can be seen in the picture. There are no pavements on this road at this stretch.

This particular shop is near to a temple and has occupied a good portion of the road itself. Added to it is the problem of vans and other vehicles parked on either side of the road. It is very difficult to even walk on this stretch. We come under Ward No 91 of Chennai Corporation and our councillor is Shri Tamil Sevlan. Our MLA is Sri Bhim Rao, Maduravoyal Constituency.Nothing has been done to remove this shop despite several representations.

S. Balasubramanian

Location: Narasingapuram Street (""Ritchie Street"" radio market).

Description of the issue: There is no space for the pedestrians to walk and placement of the garbage bins with uncleared garbage in the road/sidewalk makes walking in this crowded market very difficult.

Action required: Placing the garbage bins at the other end of the street which is a ""dead-end"", will make life easier for the pedestrians.

G. Vedantham

I have been residing in this flat since 10 years and have been a witness to the cycle garbage shown in the photo,to the right side of the gate, all these years. Nobody knows whose that garbage belongs to. On the left side, there is always a vehicle standing, causing inconveniece to the pedestrian. As there is no platform on this road people find it very difficult to walk. This street is the connecting road to the people coming from kodambakkam,T.Nagar and Mahalingapuram towards Nungambakkam, sterling Road or Chetpet.

The corporation office, the famous tennis ground, a popular school and a preview theatre are all located just at a stone’s throw away from this street. As this street is less busy school children and 2 wheelers take this route to reach their destinations as it is faster.

It becomes more difficult during rainy season, as water stagnates on the road, even if it drizzles for a few minutes. Added to this is the overflowing sewage which constantly overflows on to the road. On the whole it is a nightmare for pedestrians.

I request the concerned authorities to take necessary action for clearing the garbage, laying pavements and ensuring it is not misused and making way for the rain water to drain quickly.

Sangeetha Manivannan

Location: SRP Tools on OMR

Description: Since the Tidal park signal is jammed during peak hours, many two wheelers and autos sneak through the side walk and cross over to Thiruvanmiyur through the wrong side. They cause a lot of danger for the pedestrians and the people on road, in an attempt to save a few minutes.

Action: Ensure two wheelers and autos do not cross to the wrong side at the SRP tools signal.

While it is heartening to see The Hindu take up this cause , it is with equal disappointment I notice that the scenario in north chennai has gone unreported. Walking on pavements is a luxury that despite paying our taxes we cannot afford. Many of us from this part of the city would be glad to be able to just enter our homes unperturbed. Pavements have become slums and hub for anti social elements. It is not uncommon to find drunk men sleeping on the pavements and blocking the entrance to our homes, catcalling and troubling women. The footpath is also a parking spot for all the rikshaw drivers. They eat and defecate right in the same place. Any other space u find is marred by sewage and gutter.

I hope authorities from north chennai take notice of the worsening situation and take steps to remedy the same at the earliest to give us our basic needs of being able to walk on our pavements.

Khuze Siam

Having started the campaign, The Hindu can take the lead in continuing this by means of forming a think tank comprising prominent citizens having knowledge/expertize/business interests in urban infrastructure, from financial institutions, NGOs, academic institutions to

- Assess the kind of organization structure and resources required to manage mega cities like Chennai.

- Assess fund requirement corresponding to basic services like roads, storm water drainage, sewage/solid waste disposal system, water supply, public transport and ways and means of mobilizing the same through innovative ways.

- Engage the government machinery in a constructive manner to facilitate implementation of such plans.

- Deploy monitoring mechanism to track the funds deployment and infrastructure quality zone wise to alert the concerned officials to provide quality services.

I am sure that such long term and sustainable engagement with citizens and government will enable us to build safe and clean cities over period of time.

G. Venkata Prasad

The road leading to St. John’s School. There is heavy rush on the road during school hours. There is no pedestrian’s path, whatever space is there on the road is inundated with police case property, cuttings of shrubs/trees and unauthorised parking of institutional buses and vans. Two cars (case property) have been dumped on the road abutting CPWD Complex compound wall for the past several years. Repeated requests by the residents of the area to remove the cars have fallen on deaf ears. It has become a security threat as well as perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes. The dust bins provided by the Corporation of Chennai have been placed almost in the middle of the road. All these obstructions on the road without footpath have become traffic hazard and an eyesore for the commuters and residents of the area.

Ankita Sagar

July 15

Location: Near Vijaynagar bus stand signal, Tambaram Main road

Description of the issue: No pavement and the canal on one side of the road is filled with garbage and sewage water. This canal is encroached by commercial establishments and is used as dumping ground. Rats and mosquitoes are breeding on this and spreading diseases in this area. This gets even worse during rainy season.

Action required: Need to cover the entire canal or should make steps to avoid dumping garbage and others. Need pavement for people to walk on either side of the road.

Soundar

Jeevarathnam Nagar area in Adyar. The precious walking space has been used in the name of beautification by some private houses. Though it looks nice and prevents hawkers from using it, there is hardly any space to walk. Another part is used by road side vendors who get evicted from time to time and again return. 1st street is in tatters after the storm water laying work. Storm water remains as stagnant water inside and is a great breeding ground for mosquitos. This is a great initiative. If citizens join in and help we can prevent our civic fabric from going down the drain.

Satyajit

Location: Ashtalakshmi Nagar, 2nd street, Valasaravakkam (belongs to Maduravayol Panchayat)

Description: There is no road itself to drive or walk in Ashtalakshmi Nagar. It's very difficult for two wheelers, walkers, elderly people and everyone. It's the worst when it rains. One half of the road belongs to Maduravayol and the other to Valasaravakkam. So one half is well laid and is quite high and the other stretch is low so during the rainy season the entire water comes to the houses in the lower section.

Action required: Please lay a proper road so that it’s easier for everyone. Common man pays the tax but there are no benefits from those to the people living in Ashtalakshmi Nagar.

G. Latha

July 16

Kannagi Street, Avvai Nagar located in Choolaimedu is frequently filled with sewage water creating serious health hazards in and around that area. During rainy season, it becomes even worse for the public to use this road especially for the school children since many schools located around. Please save the street and prevent serious health hazards to the residents reside around and to public. Request a permanent solution to this problem.

D.Raja

Location: K.K. Nagar, R.K. Shanmugham Salai and K.M. Nursing Home

Description of the issue: Parking of trucks on the edge of roads. It is very difficult to walk on the footpath as trucks are using the edge of the road as permanent parking place and they should be removed

S. Ramesh Kumar

Location: Velayudham Street and Valluvar Kottam High Road

Description: A commercial establishment has encroached into the pavement besides using it as a storage space for firewood. Cooking, frying and chopping wood - all take place here.

T.Shanmugavel

Location: On Nelson Manickam Road, near Mehta Nagar Bus Stop

Description of issue: The Corporation authorities have put up garbage enclosures in Chennai, which besides taking away pedestrian space, these dumps serve no purpose as waste is dumped all around it. These are maintained so badly and is a sight for sore eyes.

One such garbage dump is seen in front of a clinic on Nelson Manickam Road - an arterial road with banks, passport kendra, IT offices and a polytechnic college. Students, office goers and public walk on this busy traffic-congested road as this garbage enclosure is kept on the footpath. The unbearable stench of rotten waste in the air and stagnated water after rains around it ensures people walk only on the road risking their lives. When will the Corporation wake up to solve public woes?

A road that's completely inaccessible to walk is the Kasturbai Nagar 3rd Cross. The entire stretch of this road on either side is not meant for the pedestrians. Unfortunately, no matter what we do, unless and until the implementation is not forceful, and the punishment is not severe, we cannot improve on the current status.

Dharmarajan

Location: Fraser Bridge Road, Opp to Hotel Fortel

Description of the issue: Pedestrians unable to walk on the pavement and causing inconvenience to the people who are waiting for the buses.

Action required: Corporation should take immediate action to clear them and ensure the pavement is safer for pedestrians.

Srivatsa Vema

The part of Velachery Main Road is a stretch which lies adjacent to the IIT Gate in Velachery. The condition of the pavement on either side of the road is very poor if at all present. It is especially worse in the direction of Vijaynagar and in many places is absent.

Judge V Ramasubramanian said the issue involved public interest, as despite the acquisition of more than 1,655 acres by the government, invoking the emergency clause, the industry for which the acquisition was made hadn’t come up. Allowing CPCL’s application, the court recalled the earlier order passed in December 20, 2010, which allowed ARCIL to take possession of the 168.35 acres.In January 1985, CPCL had signed a memorandum of understanding with SPIC for a joint venture to float a public limited company— National Aromatics and Petrochemicals Corporation—after the former received an industrial licence to manufacture o-xylene, benzene and purified teraphthalic acid. The project was named Arochem.In September 1989, the Tamil Nadu government accorded administration sanction for the acquisition of 1,655.92 acres of patta and poramboke lands in various villages.However, the project was delayed and later, SPIC floated a company called SPIC Petrochemicals Ltd and entered into an agreement with the state government for the allotment of 168.35 acres from the overall area.The agreement was subject to the company remitting all acquisition costs and the condition that after the joint venture was implemented, the unit would be integrated with the joint venture. CPCL objected to this. SPIC Petrochemicals availed of credit facilities from ICICI Bank Ltd, offering the 168.35 acres as security for the repayment of the loan.Later, SPIC Petrochemicals accumulated debt and the court issued a winding-up order against it. ICICI filed a petition with the debt recovery tribunal, Mumbai, for the recovery of about Rs 289 crore; the tribunal appointed a receiver to sell the property. ARCIL received the debts of the company in liquidation and took possession of the land. However, the official liquidator took possession of the property on May, 2010, related to an earlier litigation.ARCIL moved the court against this move.“Hundreds of acres of land, acquired hurriedly by the state of Tamil Nadu from thousands of families for the professed object of industrial development and economic growth, were eventually mortgaged with the financial institutions, without an industry coming up thereon; the financial institution is before this court for an auction sale of such land, to realise its dues from the company in liquidation,” the court said.“Therefore, in such circumstances, it is hard for this court to give a nod for the sale of the property by the secured creditor. The recalling of the order dated December 20, 2013, in a way, will be atonement by this court for upholding the acquisition made 20 years ago, for the benefit of unscrupulous elements,” the order said, adding the recall would enable CPCL to continue its earlier litigation against the land allotment.Earlier, a division bench had ordered an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the allotment of land.",issue,Tamil Nadu floods,"Tamil Nadu, India",December 2015,January 2016,"['Chennai', 'Tiruvallur', 'Kancheepuram', 'Nagapattinam', 'Cuddalore', 'Thoothukudi', 'Ramanathapuram', 'Virudhunagar', 'Dindigul', 'Theni', 'Pudukkottai', 'Ariyalur', 'Tiruchirappalli', 'Perambalur', 'Sivaganga', 'Karur', 'Namakkal', 'Salem', 'Erode', 'Coimbatore', 'Tiruppur', 'Dharmapuri', 'Nilgiris', 'Krishnagiri', 'Vellore', 'Tiruvannamalai', 'Auroville']","['1,200 mm']",['100 billion Indian rupees'],['450'],['10 million people affected'],"['The floods were caused by heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of the Cauvery, Vaigai, and Palar rivers.', 'The floods caused widespread damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and livelihoods.', 'The floods also displaced millions of people from their homes.', 'The Indian government has declared the floods a national disaster.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe
