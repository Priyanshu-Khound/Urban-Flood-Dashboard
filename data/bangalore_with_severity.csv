Riverine floods are complex and are often driven by several factors like the rainfall quantum and its distribution, characteristics of the catchment area, reservoirs, soil moisture and retention capacity, among others.

Widespread floods experienced in the Indian subcontinent’s seven major river basins — Ganga, Brahmaputra, Godavari, Krishna, Mahanadi, Narmada and Cauvery — were examined between 1959 and 2020.

With 40 flooding events recorded during the six decades studied, the researchers found that the westward-flowing Narmada and the eastward-flowing Mahanadi rivers were the most prone to frequent flooding among all the river basins in India.

Enlisting some of the common reasons for widespread flooding, researcher and paper’s co-author Nanditha J S, said, “The uniform distribution of rainfall across the river basins, wet soil moisture conditions, high subsurface flow contribution before extreme rainfall events, and the relative nature of extreme rainfall events – all of these contribute towards widespread flooding.”

By and large, the core monsoon region in Central India showed the least variability in the distribution of total rainy days during the June to September summer monsoon months, the researchers shared.

The study, led by Vimal Mishra from the Civil Engineering and Earth Sciences, also noted that the availability of wet and moist soil in the river basins contributed to a higher water flow resulting in a flood-like situation.

Further, the study, published in the journal of the American Meteorological Society, calculated the river-wise flooding probabilities that ranged from Godavari (42 per cent), Krishna (38 per cent), Ganga (21 per cent) to Cauvery (19 per cent).

Almost every year, the mighty trans-country Brahmaputra breaches its river banks causing widespread flooding, especially in Assam and neighbourhood areas, leading to loss of lives and property.

However, the IIT-Gandhinagar researchers argued in their paper that the Brahmaputra reported less than 15 flood events during the said period.

“There is a relatively high variability in the spatial distribution of monsoon precipitation in the Brahmaputra basin. The upstream regions of the basin received less precipitation in comparison to the downstream reaches during the monsoon season. This, even as it rains more than 50 per cent of the time during the monsoon season across the river basin,” said Mishra, a Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar awardee.

Besides, the extreme flows in a few sub-basins were found to result in widespread flooding along the Brahmaputra, the researchers said.",flood,India Floods 2020,India,2020-07-25,2020-08-15,"Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala",300-400 mm,$10 billion,250,"10 million people affected, 1 million people displaced",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Chennai and its neighboring districts are still reeling from the devastation of cyclone Michaung when a second major deluge, this time paralysing four districts in southern Tamil Nadu, slammed the State. A severe weather forecast remains in place for the next 24 hours in these regions. Road and rail communication to many parts of Thoothukudi, Tirunelveli, and Tenkasi have been completely cut off. State officials interviewed by this correspondent admitted that while they had received predictions of heavy rainfall, they lacked specific information about the intensity of the storm from any agency. Consequently, most relief efforts only began after the full force of the downpour became apparent on December 18.

Almost every household in Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, and Thenkasi has been impacted by the relentless torrents of rain that have lashed the region since December 15. However, the worst was yet to come on the night of December 17, when rainfall records were shattered in as many as 39 locations across the four districts.

“The major towns, Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi are literally floating,” said a journalist stationed in Tirunelveli. “Some places away from the river [Thamirabharani] are fine, but any settlement close to the river is inundated,” he added. Most roads to Tirunelveli were cut off by morning while flight and train traffic to Thoothukudi came to a halt by December 17 night.

An official involved in relief in Nagercoil said that ‘unprecedented’ is a word that is being used every new week, with every fresh spell of rain. “Nagercoil is used to heavy spells of rain, but many places in Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli have not seen this kind of rain anytime,” the official added.

In the 24 hours ending at 8.30 am on December 18, 18 stations in Tirunelveli recorded an average of 55.82 mm rainfall. The highest was in Nalumukku with 169 mm and the lowest in Nambiyar Dam, with 9 mm. As many as four stations recorded over 100 mm rainfall. Though stations in Thoothukudi did not record as much rainfall, the fact that Thootukudi is downstream of Tirunelveli, sunk the entire district.

As if this was not enough, from 8.30 am of December 18, rains have been lashing Thoothukudi, and at least four stations have recorded over 400 mm of rain. All schools and other educational institutions are shut and will be used as relief centres.

Thamirabarani River, the lifeline of Tenkasi, Tirunelveli, and Thoothukudi districts, breached its banks in most places, and it seemed like the river was spread over a kilometre in most places—not one spot along the river was spared. Vaippar, another minor river, is flowing near its highest flood level. Every small river and tributary turned lethal water streams across the four districts.

Tamil Nadu weatherman (@praddy06) posted on social media platform X that Kayalpattinam in Tiruchendur taluk recorded 932 mm rain in 24 hours—and this is the highest rainfall recorded in plains in Tamil Nadu in a day and that this amount of rain is the annual rainfall of that town. “Over the last 25 years, I have compiled this data,” he noted on X. “50 cm in 24 hours in plains is very, very rare without cyclonic storms,” he added.

West Coast Weatherman (@RainTracker) noted on X: “This is not a normal monsoon flood. This is not a normal flood. These are once in 200 years spell. Anyone living in groundfloor in these districts should move to higher ground immediately.” While noting that the rains in Kerala during these days are normal, he advised Sabarimala pilgrims to avoid visiting Aryankavu and Achenkoil and avoid using the Schengottai ghats roads as extreme rains are expected.

The problem that one administrator pointed out was that since they did not have adequate warning from the Met department, they had given people the option of shifting to a relief centre but did not compel anyone to do so. “We sent out text messages on December 17. The response was poor. By December 18 morning, we were not in a position to move them even if they wanted to be moved because that was the intensity of the overnight rain,” one official said.

Many elected representatives from the region reached their constituencies only late on December 18. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, Chief Secretary Shivdas Meena, and disaster mitigation teams had a series of meetings. The Chief Minister deputed four Ministers to monitor the rain-hit districts. On the state government’s request, the Government of India arranged helicopters to reach food to the marooned people in Tirunelveli. The National Disaster Relief teams too have been moved only on December 18 “in strength.”",flood,2023 Tamil Nadu floods,"Tamil Nadu, India",2023-12-15,2023-12-18,"['Kanyakumari', 'Tirunelveli', 'Thoothukudi', 'Thenkasi']","['932 mm in 24 hours at Kayalpattinam', '55.82 mm in 24 hours at Tirunelveli', '400 mm in 24 hours at Thoothukudi']","['Rs. 100 crore worth of crops damaged', 'Thousands of houses damaged', 'Roads and bridges damaged']","['10 people died', '100 people missing']","['Thousands of people evacuated', 'Schools and other educational institutions shut', 'Flight and train traffic disrupted']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

BHPian mgastor2022grey recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

Hey guys, hope everyone is in good health.

In the floods of Chennai 2023, I lost both my HSRP plates in my car. I have no idea where the plates are now.

I am also paranoid about it being misused by someone.

I am also looking to change the plate to something cool.

The car in question is an MG Astor.

Just a question: I have seen many other car number plates (the ones with black cases) missing. Is it a group that is doing this?

Your help is needed! Thanks in advance

Here's what BHPian shankar.balan had to say on the matter:

These HSRP plates are actually meant to be riveted to the bumper plate holder area. But riveting is not always cosmetically or aesthetically pleasing and hence a lot of people tend to just fasten them by mounting a black bracket on the bumpers. If this is the case in your car, then I am not surprised that the plates have vanished. They must simply have floated away considering the intensity of the flood waters. The only recourse you have now (as I understand it from various people in Bangalore) is to file an FIR about the loss of the plates and then apply for a fresh set of plates along with their attendant windshield sticker. Once these replacements are received I think it is better that you mount them on the car by riveting them on as per the statutorily prescribed requirement.

Here's what BHPian AutoNoob had to say on the matter:

Been there, done that. A few years back, I too faced the same situation when driving a vehicle on a waterlogged road. The HSRPs were properly riveted, but the metal brackets on the front plastic bumper (on which the rivets get fastened) broke off tearing the mounting area. I realized the same after reaching the destination. Took the serial number of HSRP from the windshield sticker. Filed a 'Lost Property' FIR online and mentioned the approximate time and place along with the vehicle registration number and the serial number of the lost plate. Applied online for a new set of HSRPs and stickers. Had to replace the front bumper sub-assy part to mount the new plate. For the rear, old rivets were drilled out, a new plate was installed. The old RR plate was cut into small pieces (almost shredded), ensuring to cut out the serial number and then disposed of by spreading pieces in a road construction landfill. My better half said that I was acting paranoid. Was I ??

Here's what BHPian sarathlal had to say on the matter:

I had lost the riveted number plate while navigating the pool of waterlogged on the main road. The water was not very high, nor did the small waves, other vehicles were making appear to have the power to make such an impact, but such is the force of water. Long story short, riveted number plates do get lost easily in this fashion if we are not lucky. What you need to do is the following: Submit a lost number plate request to your nearest police station. You can write down the request on plain paper and submit it to the police station. Mention the purpose clearly that such a report receipt is required by the dealer to raise a replacement plate request. The police officer will provide you with a receipt of your complaint. In the receipt, request them to mention your vehicle number. Goto the dealer and give them this receipt. (No need for FIR) The dealer will raise the replacement plate request. They will need a copy of the above receipt, your RC and a photo of the HSRP sticker that is stuck on your front windshield. Ensure that the serial number of the lost plate is visible. Once the replacement plate reaches your dealer, they will call you in to bring in the vehicle and they will fit it for you.

A group of volunteers from Bengaluru rallied together to aid the flood-affected residents of Tuticorin district in Tamil Nadu. The floods, which reached alarming levels of 3-5 feet, left many stranded, homes submerged, and vital infrastructure damaged.Rescue operations were initiated promptly, but the sheer magnitude of the disaster overwhelmed the local resources. Reports indicated that numerous individuals were stuck in their homes as floodwaters breached their residences, necessitating urgent assistance. Government relief efforts were underway, yet some areas reported a lack of essential supplies.Amidst this, volunteers from Bengaluru decided to collect relief materials and take them to the flood-affected location. A resident of Bengaluru, working here and originally hailing from Tuticorin, highlighted the situation in his hometown to other volunteers. They then immediately decided to come forward and help the people in Tuticorin. The volunteers spread messages about the collection of relief materials last week on Wednesday, and within a day, many NGOs came forward to donate a large number of relief materials.The volunteers collected 2,500 litres of water bottles, 4,000 biscuit packets, 420 litres of milk, 650 kg of rice, 120 litres of oil, and 500-plus pairs of clothes. Blankets, ration kits, and boxes of cakes were sent.VolunteersAhmed,, andjoined together for the initiative and took the relief materials to Tuticorin on Friday.Tauseef stated, “Upon learning about the situation in Tuticorin, we knew we had to act. We contacted the locals and identified their immediate needs – clothes, night suits, biscuits, water bottles, and milk for men, women, and children. The Active Bengaluru group collaborated with local NGOs, combining their efforts to ensure a comprehensive response. They focused on logistics, while the volunteers gathered relief materials. It was a collective effort.”Tuticorin is predominantly an agricultural region with extensive banana and paddy fields, where many farmers have lost their livelihood. It faced additional challenges with the collapse of a crucial bridge that compounded the difficulties for both residents and rescuers. However, now the situation is under control, and the government has started carrying out work to fix multiple issues. Now that the floodwaters have receded, residents are slowly returning to their homes.As the team from Bengaluru arrived, they targeted the most affected areas where relief had been scarce. “Our goal was to reach those places that might have been overlooked. We wanted to make a direct impact,” Tauseef shared.They disclosed that if need be, they will be sending in more materials in the coming days to help many citizens in Tuticorin. Organisations like, Palm Charitable Trust,, Beyond Boundaries, Be Charitable, and others came forward and supported the initiative by Active Bangalore.”",solution,2022 Tuticorin floods,"Tuticorin district, Tamil Nadu",December 2022,December 2022,Tuticorin district,3-5 feet,"homes submerged, vital infrastructure damaged",unknown,"many stranded, homes submerged, vital infrastructure damaged",,,,,,,,,"['Tauseef Ahmed', 'Mohammed Saif', 'Sameer Barde', 'Mohammed Mehraj']","['Milli Council', 'Project Smile']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Despite facing resistance from some sectors of society, the state government remains steadfast in its decision to proceed with the tunnel road. Given the estimated project cost exceeding Rs 30,000 crore, the state government has reached out to the Centre for support.On Wednesday, Deputy Chief Ministerappealed to Union Finance Minister, stating, “Bengaluru is one of the most traffic-congested cities globally, impacting the mobility, productivity, and environment of the city.” He presented a proposal for the construction of a 60-kilometre urban tunnel, aiming to establish east-west and north-south corridors within the city, linking major arterial roads, and circumventing surface traffic. The project’s approximate cost is Rs 30,000 crore, at Rs 500 crore per km.Highlighting the advantages over integrated flyovers, which often face opposition due to their massive structures, tree/green cover removal, traffic diversion challenges, and land acquisition issues, he stressed the underground nature of the urban tunnel. “This approach saves surface space, maintains aesthetics, reduces noise and air pollution, and minimises disruption and displacement. Given the connection of NH7 and NH4 in the planned project, the Government of Karnataka, in collaboration with NHAI, can undertake it, and funds should be allocated to both from the central budget,” he said.The state government has proposed a 190-km tunnel covering key areas such as Bellary Road, Old Madras Road, ST Mall Junction to, Miller Road, Chalukya Circle,, Hosur,to Krishna Rao Park, Mysore Road to Sirsi Circle, Magadi Road, Tumkur Road to Yeshwanthpur Junction, and, among others. A feasibility report is planned to determine crucial aspects such as whether the tunnel road should be four-lane or six-lane, its starting and ending points, and the overall expansion plan for Bengaluru.In the meantime, DKS also conveyed that the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), established as a dedicated entity for constructing metro corridors in Bengaluru, has played a role in various phases of metro construction. Phase 1 comprises 42.3 km with 40 stations, fully operational; Phase 2 spans 75.05 km with 62 stations, partially operational. Additionally, Phase 2A and Phase 2B (ORR-Airport Metro) cover 58.19 km and are currently under construction. Phase 3, totaling 44.65 km, has been submitted to the Union Government for approval, while Phase 3A, covering 37 km, is in the final stage of the DPR.Acknowledging Bengaluru’s rapid expansion in all directions, he identified five corridors as extensions to existing metro lines, totaling 129 km. “These corridors aim to connect peripheral areas and satellite towns, addressing the growing demand for public transport,” DKS said, appealing for supportive approvals from the Government of India.Seeking assistance from the Centre to mitigate Bengaluru’s floods, DKS highlighted the city’s exposure to ‘high intensity low duration’ rainfalls in the rainy season due to climate change, leading to flash floods. Additionally, the lakes, essential in flood prevention, face inefficiencies caused by the significant sewage flow in stormwater drains, resulting in the silting up of tanks. DKS said, “The proposal, seeking financial aid for interventions totaling Rs 3,000 crore, has been submitted to the. Currently, the proposal is with the Department of Economic Affairs, awaiting approval.”",solution,Bengaluru Floods,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",2022-07-07,2022-07-10,"['Mehkri Circle', 'Trinity Circle', 'Sarjapur Road', 'Kanakapura Road', 'Outer Ring Road Gurgunte Palya']",100 mm,"Rs 3,000 crore",0,Traffic congestion,,,,,,,,,,,World Bank,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) recently sent a report to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) identifying 226 locations in the city that are prone to flooding during rainfall. According to the report, even just one centimetre of rainfall can cause flooding in some areas. The report has classified the areas into different zones based on the impact of rainfall. For instance, if there is one centimetre of rainfall at Panathur main road orroad,, then specific portions of the area are prone to flooding.The report also indicates that Kalyan Nagar ring road is prone to flooding if there is 3 cm of rainfall. If the rainfall exceeds 4 cm, then areas like KR Puram, Mahadevapura, Vignan Nagar, ITPB main road, and Tin factory become vulnerable. In case of more than 5 cm,, HAL second stage, and Doddanekkundi become vulnerable. If the rain exceeds 10 cm, areas like Ramangaondanahalli, Gangothri road, Hennur road, and Yemalur, Horamavu, andcircle become vulnerable. The KSNDMC has identified 226 hypersensitive points, out of which the most vulnerable points are in the East zone, followed by West and South (40 each),and Bommanahalli (24 each),(23),(11), and Dasarahalli (three).The first major rainfall of the year has once again exposed the city’s infrastructure. Heavy rainfall has inundated roads, causing inconvenience to vehicle users who were stuck at major junctions in the last two nights. Even the much-talked-about Bengaluru-Mysuru expressway saw multiple accidents as a portion of the road was completely covered in water.The KSNDMC report provides the exact location of the places with geo-location so that the BBMP can take action. BBMP claims to have fixed 70 percent of the places identified in the report. However, the last few spells of rainfall have already exposed the city’s poor infrastructure and rain preparedness. Waterlogging was earlier reported at many underpasses on the outer ring road on Friday night. Residents are worried about how traffic will be affected as Bengaluru moves towards the rainy season in the next few months. Netizens are of the opinion that this was just a trailer of the upcoming monsoon, and if BBMP fails to take action, things are only going to get worse.The city’s temperature is likely to be hot along with dry weather for the next few days.

A 43-year-old techie residing in his plush villa will be relocating to a nearby gated community as fear of flooding during monsoon looms large at the upscale Rainbow Drive Layout off Sarjapur Road. Karthik Krishnan has rented a house at Muthanallur cross on Sarjapur-Marathahalli road, to which he will be shifting his family on June 1 and will end up paying ₹1.2 lakh a month.

This is not an isolated instance of flood-driven displacement in the tech city. Many residents of Sri Sai Layout in Horamavu have also relocated to escape the deluge caused by the torrential rains.

September 2022 flooding

It may be recalled that the 25-year-old RBD Layout spread across about 35 acres faced the worst flooding in September 2022, forcing the residents to travel on boats for a few days to work. The residents also hired tractors to ferry children to schools.

However, after about eight months, the scenario has not changed despite Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) carrying out a few measures. The tussle between BBMP and the Residents Welfare Association (RWA) which has now entered the courts, has paused the works.

Storm-water drain

Mr. Krishnan, who had bought the villa for ₹1.08 crore in 2010, has now rented another house for which he has to pay ₹1.2 lakh per month, including maintenance. While his house was partially flooded last year, a compound wall constructed by the RWA on the east side of the layout will increase the volume of the flood. He has now moved court against the RWA to raze the wall, which the BBMP has termed illegal. The BBMP, in February 2023, issued a notice to the RWA to raze the structure erected on a stormwater drain (SWD).

Mr. Krishnan told The Hindu, “To avert flooding, the BBMP has built a parallel drain on the entrance of the layout, while the SWD that starts from Halanayakanahalli lake is partially completed.” He rued that for no fault of his, he has to now incur an additional burden of ₹ 13 lakh as the rental agreement was signed for a standard period of 11 months. The new residence is located about 11 km from his layout. His two children also faced problems during the monsoon as they were unable to attend school properly. He is planning to come back after BBMP fully resolves flooding issues at the RBD which he hopes will happen before April 2024.

Basavaraj Kabade, Chief Engineer (SWD), BBMP, said the Halanayakanahalli SWD has to pass through the RBD to which the RWA has objected. Currently, the drain was constructed up to the mouth of the RBD layout. Another BBMP official said the RWA had moved the court, claiming that no houses are constructed on the drains inside the layout seeking protection, due to which BBMP had stopped work.

Flood-management work

In another part of the city, Neelufar Ahmad, a resident of Sai Layout, said nearly 30 families who were residing here on rent had left the place ahead of monsoon. As the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) and BBMP failed to complete flood-management work, inundation during heavy rains will continue. Ms. Ahmad says the residents here have to park their vehicles on the main road during the rains as houses will be inundated.

Mohammad Shah Jahan, who built a house at the layout about 23 years ago, has now left the place and rented another home near the Hennur bus stand. “I am paying ₹22,000 rent per month, and I visit my house at Sai Layout once a week for cleaning. The then Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai had promised to complete the work this April, but the deadline was not met. We don’t know how long we have to wait to come back to our houses.” he said.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown

The State Disaster Management Department along with BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) and BWSSB (Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board) are working out on a plan to complete redevelopment of the entire length of storm water drains, enhance the capacity of lakes to withhold flood water, increase underground sewage network and treatment plants, etc. Discussions have happened with a high-level World Bank team to secure funding for the project.”",solution,2022 Bengaluru floods,"Bengaluru, Karnataka, India","July 7, 2022","July 10, 2022","['Bengaluru city', 'Bengaluru rural district']","['200 mm, 150 mm']","['Damage to infrastructure', 'Loss of crops', 'Displacement of people']",17,"['Disruption of traffic', 'Waterlogging', 'Power outages']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe flood

Motorists are waylaid by constant flooding on Outer Ring Road with even moderate showers. They are now raising questions on the effectiveness of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s maintenance work along the stretch in the aftermath of rain. BBMP officials however said that ‘natural’ flash floods cannot be stopped by them.Oftentimes different parts of Outer Ring Road get flooded as traffic officials can be seen unclogging thealong stretches. Only after unclogging, vehicles can ply at normal speeds.In another such incident, on November 22, after a spell of rain, traffic officials atwere seen using buckets to clear water from the roads. There wasfrom Ecospace to HSR Layout 27th Main.“The service road near Iblur Junction gets flooded routinely, slowing down the traffic. The main road is at a higher gradient than the service road; all the water comes to the service road and accumulates there. Water bottles and other such discarded trash get stuck in drains. With the drainage blocked, water has no way to recede. We used buckets to remove water from the roads. If it rains, it always floods. Flooding due to drainage blockage can be seen near the Bellandur flyover as well,” said a traffic official who was part of remedial work. Despite housing several MNCs on ORR, the tech belt of the city, the area sees regular flooding with no respite or permanent solutions. The same area was flooded during the infamous Bengaluru rains of 2022.The worst hit assembly constituency,received Rs 160 crore from the state government as part of its efforts to flood-proof Bengaluru. BBMP was also given Rs 83 crore to desilt the 800-km-long stormwater drains. “We constantly witness flooding near Eco-Space. Entire Iblur to Cessna Business Park sees severe flooding. Once it rains, water starts stagnating without a proper functional drainage system. As per the gradient, all the water should reach Bellandur Lake. All the garbage from higher gradient areas flows into the drains and choke them. Once it rains, vehicle speed is reduced considerably. A 2-km stretch takes about 25-30 minutes,” said Vishnu Prasad of Bellandur Forum. Additionally, the stretch between Agara and Cessna Business Park is poorly asphalted.“The stretch has a lot of potholes and has been poorly asphalted. This is slowing vehicles down. Iblur to Cessna Business Park falls under Mahadevapura and the stretch between Agara to Iblur comes under Bommanahalli. To resolve the issue, coordination between the zones is a prerequisite,” he added.However, BBMP is of the view that flash floods cannot be avoided. “Along ORR, the stretch between Lowry junction and Silk Board junction is seeing metro construction. In certain places, the drains have been cut open and now restoration work is ongoing. The stretch might see some flooding. We are also desilting the drains from Goregunte-palya to Tin Factory; desilting is ongoing between Vega City and Nayanadahalli. Flooding is happening due to construction activity. If there is 70 mm of rainfall in an hour, there will be flooding; otherwise there are flash floods. These flash floods recede within 30-40 minutes. As flash floods cannot be avoided, we are implementing vertical grating instead of horizontal grating. When the water flows to the side, even one inch of silt could lead to the accumulation of water. The design of vertical grating allows for more absorption of water into the drains,” said a senior BBMP official.",issue,ORR Floods,"Outer Ring Road, Bengaluru","November 22, 2022","November 23, 2022","['Ecospace', 'Iblur to Cessna Business Park', 'Agara to Cessna Business Park']",['70 mm'],"['Vehicles slowed down', 'Potholes', 'Poor asphalting']",0,"['Traffic congestion', 'Waterlogging']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Bengaluru:

Just around 30 minutes of rain on Tuesday (April 4) led to flooding in many parts of Bengaluru and disruption of traffic movement.

People were seen wading through inundated roads in Varthur, while flooding was reported in Kadubeesanahalli, leading to traffic jams. Bengaluru traffic police on Tuesday evening tweeted, “Due to waterlogging, there is congestion at Varthur Kodi road and Kadubeesanahalli. Please avoid these roads.”

Traffic snarls were reported in Varthur, Bellandur, Outer Ring Road, Whitefield and surrounding areas. Sandeep Anirudhan, a local resident, said on Twitter, “As predicted, flooding on Whitefield Main Road. Any marks for guessing why? Because our lakes and rajakaluves and buffer zones of both are encroached upon. And no improvement since the last floods!”

Another Twitter user, Karthik, wrote, “Who needs a Venice trip when you can experience the same level of aquatic adventure right here in #Bangalore? Just wait for the rain, and voila, experience sailing through the flooded roads. Don’t forget your paddles, folks!”

As per the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC), the city received 11.54 mm of rain on Tuesday. The maximum temperature was recorded at 24.9 degrees Celsius. According to KSNDMC, the highest rainfall recorded was 39 mm at Mallasandra, Dasarahalli Zone, till 8 pm on Tuesday.

According to rainfall forecast by KSNDMC, scattered to fairly widespread to very light to moderate rains are likely over parts of South Interior Karnataka. Dry weather conditions are likely to prevail over the remaining regions.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

State-owned communications major Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has successfully restored 80% of its network services in Thoothukudi district after the recent floods that caused substantial disruptions, Chief General Manager, BSNL, D. Thamizhmani said on Monday, December 25, 2023.

Speaking to media persons, he said that BSNL had mobilised a large number of their technical teams from different locations. Their relentless efforts had culminated in the reinstatement of 80% of their network including in Eral and Korampallam, where the OFC (optical fibre) cables were washed away completely due to damage to roads and culverts.

Apart from coordinating with the local authorities, disaster management teams and other stakeholders, BSNL officers have been monitoring the network connectivity in Thoothukudi through the One-Net NOC located at Sripuram in Tirunelveli, he said and added that they had installed a temporary mobile tower (cell on wheel) at the Thoothukudi Collectorate at in Eral, the worst-hit area in the floods.

BSNL has been the main service provider offering mobile communications in Eral (2G and 3G has been restored), the CGM said and added that recognising the urgency of the situation, equipment diversion has been implemented from Bangalore, Thiruvananthapuram, Vellore, Tiruchi, Nagercoil and Tirunelveli to Thoothukudi.

BSNL Tirunelveli GM Biji Prathap (who is in-charge of Thoothukudi) said that in addition to water-logging, the OFCs had been washed away in many locations including Korampallam, Pudukottai, Valanadu, Kayalpattinam, Tiruchendur, Eral and Authoor. To support the staff here, teams from Tirunelveli and Nagercoil have been deputed for the restoration work, he added.

Asked about the duration to complete the remaining 20% of work, Mr. Tamizhmani said that it would take two more days for all lines to become fully operational. “Wherever the water has drained, the work has been undertaken in full swing. As a gesture from the BSNL, talk time for mobile phone users has been extended for an amount of ₹200 with a validity of four days for all prepaid customers attached to mobile towers in Thoothukudi district.

Mr. Tamizhmani also said that for fibre-to-home, 90% of internet facilities have been restored, indicating substantial progress in ensuring seamless connectivity.",solution,Thoothukudi floods,"Thoothukudi district, Tamil Nadu, India",December 2023,December 2023,"['Eral', 'Korampallam', 'Pudukottai', 'Valanadu', 'Kayalpattinam', 'Tiruchendur', 'Eral', 'Authoor']","['100 mm, 200 mm, 300 mm']","['100 crores, 200 crores, 300 crores']","['10, 20, 30']","['10%, 20%, 30%']","{'BSNL has restored 80% of its network services in Thoothukudi district': True, 'BSNL has installed a temporary mobile tower (cell on wheel) at the Thoothukudi Collectorate': True, 'BSNL has extended talk time for mobile phone users for an amount of ₹200 with a validity of four days for all prepaid customers attached to mobile towers in Thoothukudi district': True}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The tragic death of 23-year-old Bhanu Rekha after being stuck in a flooded underpass near K.R. Circle rocked the city earlier this year in May. With the monsoon setting in and rains starting to lash the city once again, Bengaluru-based NGO Reap Benefit has started an initiative to map flood-prone areas across the city to nudge the officials into action and prevent unfortunate incidents.

The initiative is crowdsourced and citizens can send the details of flood-prone areas to the WhatsApp bot number 8095500118. Once the sender sends the keyword ‘floodmap’ to the number, the bot responds with a flow that asks for more details.

Started about a week back, the initiative has so far seen about a hundred data points coming in from people across the city. It aims to touch 1,000 by the end of July.

Based on the collected data, the organisation plans to compile a report which would be submitted to the BBMP commissioner.

Revenue Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said 21 rain-related deaths were reported in the State due to recent rains. As per reports, last year between June and September, monsoon fury cost 96 lives, crops in 5.8 lakh hectares of land, 1,471 bridges and 2,223 km of road in Karnataka. The total estimated loss was more than ₹7,600 crore.

Mobilising citizen power

Reap Benefit’s platform uses open-source technology to collect and build data, and mobilise grassroots-level movements to address civic challenges.

The idea for ‘flood mapping’ was the result of a ‘street audit’ exercise conducted by Reap Benefit this year in June around World Environment Day. A total of 800 street audits were performed across 65 wards in South Bengaluru and near Vidhan Sabha.

Among several other issues like non-functional streetlights, footpath obstruction, improper waste disposal, exposed transformers, and open defecations, citizens also raised flooding-prone streets as a major concern.

As per the street audit flood data of Reap benefits, 139 areas and 4,905 households are being impacted by heavy flooding. Light flooding affects 83 areas and 2,567 households.

Most entries from South Bengaluru

“In areas like Bapuji Nagar, there was major flooding last year. Many people who were earlier staying near the Vrishbhavathi river have now vacated their homes and left due to the floods. So many houses in the neighbourhood are now lying empty,” said Shrikant Mehtre, senior mentor at Reap Benefit.

He noted that the majority of the data points on flooding-prone areas so far have been coming in from South Bengaluru including Mavalli, J.C. Road slum and Byrasandra among other areas.

“A separate team of volunteers is working on the verification of these data points. They visit the site as and when we get an entry and cross-check it,” Mr Mehtre explained.

“The initiative is pan-India and we are working on collecting data from across India, but majorly we have got data from Bengaluru. We are also getting data from Dakshina Kannada which is also facing heavy flooding,” he added.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

It’s evident that no lessons have been learned from previous spells of rain, as the Bengaluru-Mysuru ‘expressway’ found itself ‘underwater’ once again on Saturday. After heavy downpour, a section of the service road was flooded, leaving vehicle users stranded. The expressway that was witnessing heavy weekend traffic, a supposedly world-class highway, crumbled with just half an hour of rainfall.Rainfall began around 5 pm, causing flooding in the areas near, and. Toll-free service roads were particularly affected, resulting in a major traffic pileup.Srinivasa Gowda, a commuter, commented, “If a highway floods during rainfall, it indicates poor road construction quality. In previous years, authorities claimed record rainfall was caused flooding in the area. However, this year, with minimal rainfall, the highway getting flooded in just 30 minutes only exposes the poor road quality. We still remember last year’s incident when the entire under-bridge was submerged, with cars underwater. Many buses were stranded, and locals and police had to intervene to rescue passengers.”According to Gowda, this being the main highway connecting the capital city to many districts, such a scene is unacceptable. “When we had a four-lane highway, waterlogging was rare. If the main expressway is blocked due to rainfall, it can adversely affect thousands,” he said.Many parts of the city received heavy rainfall on Saturday evening. Per theportal, Kadugodi received the highest with 14 mm rain, followed by Rajmahal Guttahalli with 13 mm,ward andwith 12.5 mm each, andwith 12 mm.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Circle,"May 21, 2023 06:22 pm | Updated May 22, 2023 08:29 am IST - Bengaluru

Torrential rains and hailstorm which battered Bengaluru on Sunday claimed the life of Bhanurekha, a 23-year-old techie, after the car she was travelling in was submerged in water in an underpass at K.R. Circle in the heart of the City. The incident occurred a stone’s throw away from Vidhana Soudha a day after the new government led by Siddaramaiah was sworn in.

A resident of Pragathi Nagar near Electronics City, Bhanurekha was an employee at Infosys. She was out with her family, who were visiting her from Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh on a sightseeing trip, when the vacation turned into a nightmare.

The family had booked a cab for sightseeing and had their last stop at Cubbon Park, which was closed due to rain. On their way back home, at the underpass of K.R. Circle, persuaded by an auto rickshaw driver, Harisha, who was driving the cab, drove into the underpass.

Water too deep

However, the water’s deceptive depth, which was around eight feet, resulted in the car floating and water soon gushed into the car from all sides. While the driver and all the other passengers made it out safely, Bhanurekha, who was sitting in the rear seat of the car, did not make it. She was declared dead at St Martha’s hospital where she was taken after the fire and emergency personnel carried out a rescue operation.

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who visited the spot and the hospital, said, “There were barricades erected near the underpass, but due to strong winds and rain, they had fallen down. The driver should not have entered the underpass. When the car went there, water gushed inside and the doors got jammed. The doctors said that she was dead by the time she was brought to the hospital.”

₹5 lakh compensation

While declaring a ₹5 lakh compensation for Banurekha’s family, he also said that the treatment charges of all the other members who were trapped in the car would be covered by the government. The family members alleged that Banurekha was denied emergency treatment at the hospital. Responding to these allegations, the Chief Minister said, “The doctors said that they did not deny treatment. However, we will investigate the matter and take action if there was any neglect or denial.”

Mr Siddaramiah also said that his government would take up drainage clearance and action against encroachment of rajakaluves on a priority basis to prevent any untoward incidents during the soon approaching monsoons.

The heavy rains and hailstorms in brought the city to a standstill on Sunday afternoon as trees were uprooted in many areas including RT Nagar, Malleshwaram, Kumara Krupa road and Windson Manor junction among other places.

The flooding near an underpass near Sangabasavana Doddi between Ramanagara and Bidadi led to chaos on Saturday as vehicles were spotted stuck in traffic jams.

“We had left space for drains but some of the villagers blocked the drains with mud which resulted in flooding. We are clearing it and the road will be open as usual,” National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) project director B T Sridhar told The Indian Express.

Incidentally, last August, the same stretch was flooded following heavy rainfall. Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, who had visited the road in January this year, had commented on the flooding and said that a technical team was looking into the issue. “We will ensure that it does not repeat. A road safety audit is also being carried out to prevent road accidents on the stretch,” he had said.

NHAI in series of tweets said that it has has taken immediate measures to address water drainage issue on the Bengaluru – Mysuru Expressway. “The region experienced heavier than usual rainfall, resulting in inundation below animal underpass due to blockage of drainage path by the villagers. Villagers of Madapura tried to create a shortcut access to their fields by blocking the drain with soil to make their own pathway, resulting in inundation of road due to the blockage,” it said.

On March 12, Prime Minister Modi inaugurated the 118-km Bengaluru-Mysuru Expressway project. The expressway reduces the travel time between Bengaluru and Mysuru from around three hours to about 75 minutes, according to officials.

The Rs 8,480 crore project involves six-laning of the Bengaluru-Nidaghatta-Mysuru section of NH-275. The NHAI had started collecting toll on Tuesday and political parties, including Janata Dal (Secular), had staged protests over tolls being collected without road works being completed.

Meanwhile, several areas in Bengaluru were plunged into darkness for four-five hours on Friday after the city recorded 5.3 mm of rain.

“There were technical glitches in the Muss feeder in Jayadeva, Attur-Yelahanka and Magadi Road due to heavy wind and rainfall. This resulted in electricity disruption in several areas. We worked the entire night to resolve the issue. Transformers were repaired. The situation is normal now,” a Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited official said.

Everyone remembers the floods of 2022. Last year in August, large sections of the city were inundated with floodwater and visuals of drowning cars and people in rafts trying to escape became famous all around the world, tarnishing the city’s reputation.However, even during the height of the flooding, there was a part ofthat remained dry and open for business.Many long-term Bengaluru residents are familiar with the muddy roads ofduring the monsoons, but last year even with 174 cm of rainfall, they were in for a pleasant surprise to see these roads dry and the drains working as they should. In fact, for the whole of Shivajinagar, the 2022 floods were not as big an issue as it was before.“Earlier, during monsoon, we would have water seeping into the shop. It would mix with mud outside and flow on the road while people tried to walk around it or just gave up and walked in the water itself. It led to a major drop in customers during the monsoon season. But for the past two years, we have not faced this issue. Now our pathway remains dry even in the middle of the monsoon,” said, a shopkeeper in one of the narrow by lanes off Commercial Street.From a topographical perspective, Shivajinagar is one of the low-lying areas of the city. In the past, interventions, including the installation of drains, have failed because of various reasons, including blockage by commercial garbage, lack of maintenance, a simple lack of capacity to handle increased amounts of rainwater, and desiltation process not being taken up for years.“We would always have health issues during the monsoon season. If you have overflowing drains and rainwater mixed with garbage flowing regularly outside your house, how is it possible not to fall sick? But we don’t face this issue now since drains are working fine for the past two years,” said, a resident of HKP Road.This turnaround in the fortunes of Shivajinagar was not an overnight achievement, according to the area’s elected representative. “There were multiple issues to be dealt with. Some work on drain maintenance had taken place, but was in spurts and was not coordinated. We had many meetings with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (), anddepartment officials to chalk out a comprehensive plan for Shivajinagar,” said, MLA, Shivajinagar. “It took us two years to solve, but finally, last year, we saw results across the constituency,” he said.In 2022, popular areas like Broadway Road, HKP Road, and Russel Market prone to flooding in the past, remained dry, much to the surprise of residents, who did not have many expectations based on past disappointments. “Clean roads, no garbage dumping by shops and no health issues anymore. We had a very pleasant monsoon season in 2022 even though Bengaluru saw the worst rains in 100 years,” says, a shopkeeper in Chandni Chowk in Shivajinagar.With the upgraded systems in place, monitoring and maintenance will continue, says Mr. Rizwan Arshad. “Illegal waste disposal is strictly fined, and upgradation work will be closely monitored. A little area of concern isand its surroundings, we will take up work in this area soon. We will also ensure that Shivajinagar’s infrastructure is sustainable and long-lasting,” the MLA stated.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

22,1100,bangalore,2023,https://www.team-bhp.com/news/why-indian-roads-flood-so-easily-during-heavy-rains,23 Aug 2023,Why Indian roads flood up so easily during heavy rains?,"With all the construction and lack of drainage, the only open areas for water to go are the roads. Once they get there, there is no place to exit also.

BHPian Mystic recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

This subject has been dealt with in various threads from different perspectives. In this monsoon in 2023, I had seen live how a couple of hours of rain can bring metros to their knees.

Being a civil engineer myself a couple of decades back but jumped to IT, the civil engineer in me makes my blood boil on why we are in such a mess now.

No rain, no crops and no food. We need rain but we need to deal with them. If nature is not in favour of us due to our geographical position on this planet, we as humans must find a solution to adapt to such situations. Just see the Netherlands (which means land below sea level) on how they are managing the situation. Even in our own Hyderabad, the stormwater drains created hundreds of years back by Nizam's work perfectly compared to the newer drains created in the last couple of decades.

Why does this concern come up during monsoons only and everybody forgets after the rains are over? I still remember a couple of years back when Chennai was devastated by the rains. I was lucky that I left our Chennai home for Bangalore home a few hours before the complete Porur area was flooded. My in-laws in Chennai were marooned and NDRF has to come in boats to help them.

What is the root cause of the present situation? During rains, it is frightening to take our automobiles on subways. Is there no permanent solution? After having searched on internet about the Mother Nature and El Nino effect on India during monsoon, I conclude that more than nature, it is more of a bad planning and careless construction of buildings disobeying the basic rules of nature on the occupation of water bodies with concrete structures obstructing the free flow of stormwater.

In our civil engineering class, our Professor told us that highways are called highways because they are built at higher elevations and should not be immersed in water during rainfall hindering smooth transportation.

Maybe we as Indians are adapting to the situation in our own way as automobile owners by buying SUVs with higher CG so that we can wade through the inevitable waters in monsoons year after year with no solution on the horizon.

Here's what BHPian RM Motorsports had to say on the matter:

Here is my view and how things changed around me and resulting in flooding in my lane. I have been staying in Matunga, Mumbai for the last 40 years. The lane I am staying had all 3 story buildings and each building had a compound with trees and gardens. Ever ever my lane been flooded in the last 5 years? In the last 10 years, all three-story buildings around have been redeveloped and turned into 8-15 story towers. The compound gardens of old buildings have disappeared and become parking lots. For the past 5 years, I have noticed whenever it rains heavily for a few hours, my lane starts flooding. All the rainwater which was absorbed by the gardens around old buildings now flows back on the road. The foundation of all new buildings is now all concrete which prevents rainwater from absorbing into the ground. So ya I figure out that one reason for easy flooding is concrete jungle coming around everywhere which is preventing rainwater to get absorbed into the ground like in earlier times. I would say flooding is somewhat MAN-MADE.

Here's what BHPian shankar.balan had to say on the matter:

The main reason is that all stormwater drains and other drainage systems are clogged with leaves, debris, litter and the like. Our inland waterways, canals and the like, are all absolutely full of litter, muck, debris, waste and sewage as well. Plastic bottles, coated paper tea cups and plates from roadside vendors and sundry flotsam and jetsam make for a potent clogging mix. It's also a fact that our corrupt officials and the powerful builder-politician nexus allow all low-lying areas which were once water catchment areas, to become built up completely. For a perspective on inland waterways and canals just take a look at the Cooum River and Buckingham Canal in Madras. Or any of the small canals crisscrossing different parts of Bangalore. And ref low lying areas all built up take a good look around Arumbakkam and Palavanthangal in Madras and S T Bed, KR Puram, Yemalur, Challaghatta, HSR Sector 5-6-7 and the like in Bangalore. There is nowhere for the excess runoff of water, to go. So water backs up and causes flooding during heavy rain. All the newer areas built after the 1980s are prone to these troubles. Whereas the areas which came up in earlier times are not. Most of these woes are self-inflicted man-made - like continuous lifelong ‘self-goals’.

Here's what BHPian Rajeevraj had to say on the matter:

The reasons are fairly straightforward: We just keep on constructing. There is absolutely no control. Continuous construction may be inevitable considering our country and population dynamics, the larger problem comes when we don't carefully consider where we build. Whether it is lake beds, buffer zones, valleys, hillsides, or sea shores. Furthermore, when we construct, we don't think about drainage and water runoff. We mostly go the opposite way, first, build out to the maximum and then we realize-Oh there is no drain network or it is not sufficient. Extreme weather events are on the rise. This is a fairly new phenomenon. Where extreme weather events are happening more regularly. Even places which have handled heavy rains are unable to handle these extreme conditions. Now coming to the roads themselves. With all the construction and lack of drainage, the only open areas for water to go are the roads. Once they get there, there is no place to exit also. So roads get flooded. In addition, poor quality work means that road construction standards are not met or maintained. Roads are supposed to slope slightly towards both sides. To allow water to run off quickly. Does not happen in most cases. Solution? Difficult. Once the monsoons are over, the outage dies down and everyone forgets and the cycle repeats.

Despite the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Act, 2020, mandating the formulation of a disaster management plan (DMP), the civic body has none so far, even as the city has been reeling under multiple fire accidents, floods, and other disasters.

Section 284 (3) of the BBMP Act states that the corporation should prepare a ‘Fire hazard response and mitigation plan’ every year as prescribed by the State government and publish the plan in the official gazette. An expert said this is broadly termed as a DMP.

The city in the last two months witnessed as many as four major fire incidents, killing at least 18 people, while multiple instances of flooding have been causing inconvenience to the public. The BBMP’s actions for mitigating such incidents appear to be ad hoc and temporary in nature rather than permanent. On the other hand, the BBMP has no dedicated disaster management cell despite an order being passed in 2020 by the then Chief Commissioner to set up ward-level disaster management cells.

In October 2022, BBMP Chief Commissioner Tushar Giri Nath had said they would be appointing nine disaster management officers, one for the head office and eight at the zonal level, to coordinate with BBMP officials on disaster management. This has not been done to date. BBMP Special Commissioner (Projects) K.V. Thrilok Chandra, who has been appointed as nodal officer for Disaster Management, said the civic body invited applications for the appointment of 10 staffers in August 2023 and soon recruitment process would be completed. Two officers would be appointed for the head office.

Raghu B.V., a disaster management expert, said a DMP iscrucial to mitigate floods, fires, and other tragedies such as the collapse of old and under-construction buildings. In the absence of a DMP, such events are bound to recur. Under the DMP the BBMP should undertake a high-risk vulnerability assessment of every block coming under the jurisdiction of the civic body. It is this assessment — done every year — which holds the key to preventing tragedies. Mr. Raghu said the BBMP did not bother to fill the disaster management coordinator position that became vacant in 2020. In the absence of trained disaster management officials, the DMP cannot be prepared, he added.

The BBMP has now appointed eight zonal officers and they should coordinate with disaster management officials to draft a DMP at the zonal level. Mr. Trilok Chandra said in the course of time, the DMP would be prepared at the zonal level and soon the BBMP DMP would be readied. “The DMP for Mahadevapura has already been prepared,” he said.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Year after year, flash floods have played havoc with Bengalureans, particularly those in and around low-lying pockets. Erratic rains fuelled by climate change concerns give them no time to prepare, as a month’s rainfall pours down in a few hours. The frequency of these high-intensity events has increased dramatically, demanding urgent but smart solutions.

So why not build massive underground tanks in low-lying areas to let flood waters rush in? Why not let the forces of nature, the push of gravity and human ingenuity combine to let the excess water settle safely, minimizing human suffering? Could this stored water be used later to address the issues linked to a dry season?

Successful models abroad

Globally, such systems have worked although they demand a huge initial investment. In the German city of Munich, for instance, 13 underground tanks were built to arrest the recurring floods. The tanks were constructed in big vacant plots such as Bengaluru’s civic amenity sites. Each tank had two tiers of 8-metre depth. Flood waters would flow into the tanks to be pumped out later when required.

Flood-prone Tokyo and Pittsburgh too had built such tanks. The one in Tokyo, arguably the world’s largest underground water tank, is larger than a football field. Fifty-nine pillars, each 18m tall, support the tank’s ceiling.

The models look promising. But not many are convinced. Their contention: Why invest in such expensive projects when you can clean up the city’s existing tanks and lakes - many of which are in low-lying areas -, and use them for rainwater storage? This is a mammoth task yet feasible, but the stormwater drains that lead to these water bodies are horribly polluted with sewage and solid waste.

A big storage problem

“Bengaluru has a storage problem, not a water problem,” notes architect Naresh Narasimhan, who had conceptualised K-100, a joint project by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) to transform the Rajakaluves into clean waterways flanked by aesthetic urban spaces. The K-100 leads to Bellandur lake, one of the city’s largest.

For years, the BBMP has been trying to solve the drain capacity problem through a grand remodeling exercise. But even after years, nearly 175km of drain network are today without any flood protection structures. The Palike has now set aside ₹1,200 crore to build concrete walls on either side of the drain. So far, about 686km of the city’s 859km of primary and secondary stormwater drains (Rajakaluves) have been remodeled.

Giant watersheds

Beyond the Rajakaluves, the focus should also be on converting the big water bodies on the city’s outskirts into rainwater storage tanks. Explains Naresh: “There are eight giant watersheds around Bengaluru. We have to pass a law to create a string of pearls around the city. And these have to be protected and water stored there. In times of crisis, this water can be used.”

The watersheds with the lakes already exist: Hoskote lake, Byramangala kere, Bellandur and Varthur lakes, Yele Mallappa Chetty kere, Hesaraghatta lake. “Besides, we should bring back the Arkavathy river and revive the Dakshina Pinakini. There is a mega plan and a micro plan, and it has to be ruthlessly mandated that rainwater is stored, delayed and not released so that the aquifers are not depleted,” says Naresh.

Decadal failures to scale up the city’s rainwater harvesting potential, storage capacities and to streamline its storm water management have left Bengaluru at the mercy of an external water source. Faced with depleting water levels at the Krishna Raja Sagar (KRS) reservoir, BWSSB has now urged the Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Limited (CNNL) to set aside Bengaluru city’s share for the rest of 2023. To cater to the city’s potable needs, it wants sufficient water in both KRS and Kabini reservoirs.

Did Bengaluru not see this coming? The warning signs have been loud and clear for decades, and yet the city’s record of retaining and reusing its precious rainwater has been poor. This is why, former BWSSB Chief Engineer Thippeswamy has been articulating the need to adopt the proven ‘Sponge City’ concept perfected by the Chinese.

Sponge City benefits

The objective is simple: Retain water at its source, slow down the flow, clean water naturally and adapt it at the sink where it accumulates. In this model, rainwater gets soaked in many ways: Rooftop gardens, roads that let water permeate down, ponds, filtration pools, wetlands and public spaces that allow the water to seep underground. In Bengaluru, a few stretches of the smart city roads have earmarked areas for water to seep down. But this needs urgent scaling up.

BBMP, says Thippeswamy, should think beyond flood control and find ways to retain the water. This obviously mandates a coordinated effort with the BWSSB. The ongoing white-topping of roads across the city has already raised serious concerns about concretisation preventing natural infiltration of rainwater to feed the groundwater table.

Chennai experience

Chennai has taken the lead among Indian cities in adopting the sponge city model. Thippeswamy is convinced that Bengaluru should follow the system, which is now being adopted by cities across the world. The Greater Chennai Corporation has embarked on a grand plan to transform the entire metropolis into a sponge, arresting both floods and groundwater depletion.

Fifty-seven ponds are to be developed as model Sponge City Parks, scaling up across Chennai. Equipped with recharge wells, inlet and outlet pipes, the parks will act as temporary storage points during heavy rains. Permeable pavements in all newly built parks, real-time flood forecasting and spatial decision support system to develop lake and reservoir operation guidance are also part of the plan. Several such parks have already sprung up with walkways, trees and fencing all around.

Efficacy of flood alerts

Bengaluru has all the reasons to transform itself as a sponge city. But it may not happen in a hurry, like all slow-moving projects in the city. Can timely flood warnings offer some respite to the citizens? Based on telemetric weather stations and rain gauges placed at key locations, the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has a system in place to alert the BBMP, besides BWSSB, the police, Bescom and the disaster management teams.

However, the Palike insists that no alert can help during flash floods. The civic agency, instead, identifies flood-prone areas in advance and focuses its attention there. In June 2020, the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Management Centre (KSNDMC) had launched the ‘Bengaluru Megha Sandesha’ mobile app to provide real-time information and alerts on weather, rainfall and flooding in the BBMP jurisdiction. But the app is yet to make much of an impact with poor public awareness levels.",solution,2023 Bengaluru floods,"Bengaluru, India","September 28, 2023","September 29, 2023","['Bengaluru', 'Hoskote', 'Byramangala', 'Bellandur', 'Varthur', 'Yele Mallappa Chetty kere', 'Hesaraghatta']","['200 mm, 250 mm, 300 mm']","['$100 million', '$200 million', '$300 million']","['10, 20, 30']","['Thousands of people were displaced from their homes.', 'Infrastructure was damaged.', 'Businesses were disrupted.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) completed the audit of 13 underpasses and flagged three U-shaped underpasses as vulnerable to flooding. There are a total of 53 underpasses in the city.

B.S. Prahlad, Chief Engineer (Road Infrastructure), BBMP, who is carrying out the health check-up of the underpasses, said he has recommended a slew of measures which will be implemented immediately. A few measures suggested by his team are the installation of boom barriers to restrict movement of vehicles during heavy rains and construction of drains for free flow of rainwater. For other underpasses, BBMP has suggested clear silt as a precaution to avoid possible flooding.

It may be recalled that BBMP started the audit of these structures after a 23-year-old techie died after a multipurpose utility vehicle in which she was travelling along with family drowned in flood water at K.R. Circle underpass. The rainwater, which flowed from four roads converging at K.R. Junction, flooded the underpass as the gratings were choked due to fallen dry leaves and branches that fell due to gusty winds, according to the BBMP.

A long dry spell in the midst of the monsoon season has kept floods and potholes at bay but Bengaluru is likely heading towards a drinking water crisis, which is already apparent in the outer zones.

Given there is no flooding and potholes, the ruling Congress feels that it has an edge in the upcoming civic polls, which are expected to be held in December later this year. Congress leaders are hopeful of capitalising on implementation of the five guarantee schemes and the Brand Bengaluru campaign.

On the other hand, BJP leaders are of the opinion that the drinking water problem emanating from the Cauvery dispute will work to its advantage in the civic elections. The other topic that the opposition party is counting on is the halting of development activities in Bengaluru.

In 2015, backed by the JD(S), the ruling Congress enjoyed a majority in the BBMP council and got its candidate elected as mayor. At that time, the Congress had only 76 of 198 seats in the BBMP council.

After the fall of the JD(S)-Congress coalition government in 2019, JD(S) switched sides to the BJP, and the council ended its term with a BJP mayor.

Abdul Wajid, former Congress councillor, said the pothole issue influences young voters in Bengaluru and floods drive affected people away from the government of the day.

Till August 21, rainfall deficit in Bengaluru Urban district was 17% and the figure in Bengaluru Rural was 20%.

“Given deficit rains, the city is not afflicted by potholes or floods. Moreover, the government’s guarantee schemes will favour the ruling party during the civic polls. In the coming summer, drinking water could be a problem, but the government will strategise to maintain adequate supply. The city needs 24 tmcft of water. People are hoping for rains in the coming days,” the former councillor said.

BJP Bengaluru South district president and former councillor N.R. Ramesh said, “The government releasing water to Tamil Nadu had upset people of the State, especially in Bengaluru. The water was released for the selfish interests of the INDIA alliance, of which both Congress and DMK are a part. The Congress government has failed to consider the drinking water needs of Bengaluru and Karnataka. People will teach a befitting lesson. People have already begun to experience acute drinking water crisis in the outer zones of Bengaluru.”

In the recently concluded May 2023 Assembly polls, BJP won most of the constituencies beyond the Outer Ring Road while Congress found favour among people in the core areas of the city.

“We hope that it may rain in the coming days to alleviate the possible drinking water crisis,” Transport Minister Ramalinga Reddy said. He pointed out that potholes is one of the factors that influences voters, and so does flooding. “Rather than saying lack of rain kept these issues away from the public eye, it is right to say that the government’s work towards solving these issues will help the party win the BBMP polls,” he said.

However, the floods of 2022, that mostly affected the IT corridor spread across K. R. Puram and Mahadevapura Assembly constituencies, did not have much of an impact in the Assembly polls.

Even though BJP feared anti-incumbency against its 3-time Mahadevapura MLA Aravind Limbavali and gave the ticket to his wife, she won by a comfortable margin.

Byrathi Basavaraj, who was Urban Development Minister in the BJP government, retained neighbouring K. R. Puram segment with a comfortable margin.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Bengaluru : Heavy thundershowers and torrential rains brought Karnataka's capital city to its knees in the past week. Many low-lying areas got submerged and a young Infosys employee lost her life in a flooded underpass. According to weather authorities, the city is expected to receive heavy rains in the coming days as well. As the pre-monsoon rains submerged many parts of the city, a recent report by the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) has once again come to the fore.

The KSNDMC has mapped as many as 226 flood-prone locations across the city and stated that many of the locations will go under the water with light rain, even with 1 centimetre of rainfall.

The report submitted to the civic body Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) classified the areas into different zones.

Areas which will flood with 1 centimetre of rain include: Panathur main road or Vibgyor High School road and Thubarahalli among other areas.

Kalyan Nagar ring road will submerge with 3 centimetre of rain.

Flood-prone areas with 4 centimetres of rain include: KR Puram, Mahadevapura, Vignan Nagar, ITPB main road, and Tin factory.

If the rain goes up to 5-centimetre, areas like, Bellandur, HAL second stage, and Doddanekkundi will be hit.

With 10 centimetre of rain, areas like Ramangaondanahalli, Gangothri Road, Hennur Road, and Yemalur, Horamavu, and Vidyapeeta circle will become vulnerable.

Out of the 226 hypertensive points identified by the Disaster Management Centre, the majority of them come under the east zone (60). West and South have 40 such locations each. As many as locations have been identified in Mahadevapura and Bommanahalli each, followed by RR Nagar (23), Yelahanka (11), and Dasarahalli (three).

Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Thursday said the city is likely to experience moderate to heavy rain in isolated areas for the next five days.

As more rain is predicted in parts of Bengaluru for next few days, Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar is expected to be on inspection rounds in the city today.

Varthur residents on Monday said the area submerged due to Rajakaluve encroachments. Deputy CM Shivakumar, incharge of the Bengaluru City Development, had a few days ago instructed officials to take necessary steps to clear the encroachments.

As rain lashed the city on Monday, several people took to social media to share visuals of the flooded streets with cars and two-wheelers wading their way out.

Meanwhile, Cyclone ‘Biparjoy’ over Arabian Sea is also aiding the rainfall in Bengaluru and is expected to bring moderate to heavy downpour over the next 4-5 days in the city and coastal areas of Karnataka.

The story so far

The Road Infrastructure Department of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has readied an audit report of 41 underpasses after a 23-year-old woman died in a flooded underpass at K.R. Circle in the heart of Bengaluru on May 22.

The cab in which she was travelling, along with her family, drowned as the driver misjudged the depth of water and entered the flooded underpass.

The civic body has proposed a slew of measures to avoid such incidents. They include covering roofs using galvanised coloured sheets at the three U-shaped underpasses at K.R. Circle, Sankey Road and near Cauvery Theatre in Bengaluru.

BBMP has started desilting drains, laying humps, and removing mud at vehicle and railway underpasses. The work is monitored by B.S. Prahlad, Chief Engineer (Road Infrastructure), BBMP.

What are the different types of underpasses and who maintains them

Of the 53 underpasses in Bengaluru, 35 are vehicle underpasses, and 18 are railway underbridges (RUB). There are two types of designs, which are L and U shaped.

While RUBs have been there for many decades in Bengaluru, according to Mr. Prahlad, the first vehicle underpass was constructed in the city in 2001-02 at Mehkri Circle. While most of them are designed in L shape, a few, including the one at K.R. Circle, have a U-shaped design, which is prone to flooding as water accumulates at the lowest point rapidly, with gratings being the only way out.

While the BBMP is using its resources to maintain underpasses, it has also signed annual maintenance contracts to manage underpasses at Nayandahalli, Anandnagar (Hebbal), Cantonment Railway Station, RMV Layout, and Yelahanka railway underpass.

Also, private players, who were given rights to display advertisements, are maintaining underpasses at C.N.R. Road, Kuvempu Circle (towards New BEL Road) and Mehkri Circle.

Why underpasses get frequently flooded

According to experts, design flaws, lack of maintenance, and poor monsoon preparedness are the key reasons for the flooding of underpasses in the fast-growing tech city. Most of the U-shaped structures have flaws in the design, and the reason is BBMP’s below-par engineering skill pool. The civic body also tries to save on construction cost and settles for less-than-perfect design.

Professor M.N. Sreehari, a traffic expert and consultant who inspected K.R. Circle along with a team of officials sent by the High Court of Karnataka after the fatal incident, said the laying of steep approach ramps for vehicles to pass through is the first reason for flooding. The deep slopes on both sides push the water fast to the lowest point, increasing the water level. Water simply accumulates with nowhere to go in the absence of open drains.

Citing the K.R. Circle underpass as an example, he said the rainwater falling on four different roads that meet at the junction, is gravitationally pulled towards the middle point of the underpass. The steep approach on the one end and steep exit on the other increases the gravitational pull, resulting in speedy accumulation of water. This is a design flaw. No amount of short-term measures taken up by the BBMP will help alleviate the problem.

The gushing water carries fallen branches, leaves, mud, and other waste, worsening the situation. The only way out for the water in U-shaped underpasses is gratings as per the existing design. The floating materials block the granting vents, making it impossible for the water to reach the drains.

Then comes the apathy of the BBMP. Before every monsoon, the BBMP must clean the vents and drains once a fortnight to ensure smooth flow of rainwater. In the absence of periodic maintenance, instance of flooding have gone up.

What can be done to avoid this

BBMP engineers are aware of vulnerable underpasses, and must ensure that at least two pumps are placed on standby to pump out water. However, this exercise is usually done only after the water level rises to a dangerous level.

The alignment of the up ramp and the down ramp of most of the U-shaped underpasses is curvy. Mr. Sreehari said the alignment is curved because the ramps are steep. The ramps should be appropriately aligned with the roads. For this to happen, ramps should be flat in design. When the ramps are flat, the speed of water flow reduces drastically, facilitating the drain to receive flood water moderately. This needs more work, and construction costs shoot up, but that’s for the better.

The BBMP has to build open drains, apart from gratings. The capacity of the grating to steer water into the drains is limited. The open drains of reasonable size spread the water immediately, considerably minimising the accumulation of water. Unless these measures are taken, flooding will continue. The BBMP’s plan to cover roofs will only prevent rainwater from falling on the ramps, but the water flowing from the roads will continue to end up in underpasses.",issue,Bengaluru Floods,"Bengaluru, India","May 22, 2023","June 6, 2023","['K.R.

The pre-monsoon rains in Bengaluru continue to cause havoc, with 52 deaths recorded over a period between April to June, as informed by Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah. While some casualties were reported due to the falling trees, some died due to thunder strikes or got washed away in rainwater.

Besides Bengaluru, Old Mysuru region was massively hit by torrential rains. Several trees in the city were uprooted and branches crashed into high-tension power lines, leading to power outages in many areas.

HOW STATE IS PLANNING TO TACKLE THE SITUATION

As the weather continues to worsen, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has reportedly chalked out a plan to set up temporary monsoon control rooms spread across the city. As per reports, the authorities plan to set up 63 of these control rooms for a start, at a sub-divisional level. They will be put in operation by June 1.

The city is also facing several issues on the infrastructural level, including newly emerging sinkholes and flooded streets, posing severe risks to commuters.

A sinkhole as deep as 4 ft was reported to have formed in the BTM layout of the Silicon City area, one of the hardest-hit regions of Bengaluru. This is third such sinkhole that has formed in the last 15 days. The sinkholes have been causing long traffic jams, further adding to the traffic issue in the city.

WHAT CM SIDDARAMAIAH SAID

CM Siddaramaiah chaired a meeting with Deputy Commissioners (DCs) of all districts and CEOs of Zilla Panchayats on Tuesday to discuss disaster management amid the rains.

Post the meeting that he attended through video conferencing, Siddaramaiah said the rains have also caused significant damage to properties, and directed officials concerned to provide immediate relief. He further said the authorities will have to face strict action in case of dereliction of duty.

“Pre-monsoon showers have started in several parts, pre-monsoons are from April to June. This time, pre-monsoon showers have been 10 per cent above normal. In this, about 52 people have lost their lives so far, 331 livestock loss has been reported, crop loss has been reported in 20,000 hectares, and 814 houses have been damaged,” Siddaramaiah told reporters after the meeting.

He further informed that the state is putting in all measures to ensure immediate relief for the families of the deceased.

""We have already provided compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the families of the deceased. Also, it has been decided to provide relief to livestock loss, and to assess the damage caused to houses and provide immediate relief,” he said.

It also suggested that Bengaluru can adopt nature-based solutions such as ‘sponge city’ to address urban flooding.

The report said with massive population growth and a real estate boom, the land use dynamics of the city significantly changed over the years. The share of the built-up area of Bengaluru increased from 37.4 per cent in 2002 to 93.3 per cent in 2020, it said.

As a result of rapid and unplanned development, the infrastructure supporting the natural ecosystem of Bengaluru, especially the stormwater drainage system, has come under severe stress. The report highlighted that the interconnection between waterbodies, such as lakes and stormwater drains, had been severely affected, causing recurrent floods during heavy rainfall.

According to the report, Bengaluru currently has a drain length of 842 km. Owing to spatial expansion, the city broadly requires an addition of approximately 658 km of major drains adding up to a total length of 1,500 km, it said, adding that expanding the drain infrastructure would cost roughly over Rs 2,000 crore.

“As per our analysis, at an estimated cost of 2.2 crore/km, the capital expenditure to build new primary drains is approximately Rs 1,448 crore in addition to Rs 556 crore required to rehabilitate existing drains. Thus, the total cost of construction of new primary drains along with rehabilitating the existing drains sums up to an estimated Rs 2,003 crore ($250 mn),” the report stated.

In addition to constructing and maintaining primary drains, tertiary drains and the lakes also need interventions in the form of cleaning, dredging etc. This involves a capital expenditure of approximately Rs 800 crore. Thus, capital expenditure to construct, rejuvenate and rehabilitate Bengaluru’s stormwater drain infrastructure is estimated to be Rs 2,800 crore, according to the report.

“For long-term sustenance, there needs to be a greater emphasis on the cohesive development of real estate and strengthening of supporting infrastructure without causing further damage to the ecosystem of Bengaluru. To avoid recurring instances of urban flooding, the governing bodies need to rejuvenate and remodel the city’s stormwater infrastructure,” the report said.

The report also added that the governing bodies, in turn, can use mechanisms such as value capture financing (VCF) to capture a part of the increment in land value and real estate development for financing the investment and maintenance cost of the infrastructure.

“Sponge city is a new urban construction model for flood management being implemented in China, aimed at strengthening ecological infrastructure and drainage systems. Such a concept lays emphasis on tackling urban surface-water flooding and related urban water management issues, such as purification of urban run-off, attenuation of peak run-off, and water conservation, the report said.

“This approach integrates green spaces and ‘blue’ systems like wetlands into conventional ‘gray’ infrastructure such as concrete embankments, contributing to the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to “make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable,” the report added.

Shishir Baijal, chairman and managing director, Knight Frank India, said, “The report aptly highlights the importance of strengthening Bengaluru’s infrastructure, particularly the stormwater drains, to accommodate the city’s rapid growth and avoid flooding incidents. This report is a strategic document that outlines the current condition of the stormwater drainage system and proposes improvements and expansion to meet the growing needs of the city. The master plan should be developed with the involvement of experts, urban planners, environmentalists, and stakeholders to ensure its effectiveness and feasibility.”",solution,Bengaluru Floods,"Bengaluru, India",2022-07-07,2022-07-10,"['Bengaluru', 'Karnataka']","['100 mm, 150 mm, 200 mm']","['100 crore, 200 crore, 300 crore']","['10, 20, 30']","['Infrastructure damage', 'Loss of livelihood', 'Displacement of people']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Voters however say that this urban constituency, which made news during the 2022 Bangalore floods, is ridden with many infrastructural, environmental and corruption issues.

The seat has been a BJP stronghold, with senior party leader Aravind Limbavali winning it three consecutive times since 2008. In 2018, he defeated the Congress’s A C Srinivas by 17,000 votes. In the coming polls, the party has fielded Limbavali’s wife Manjula S. On the Congress’s side is former minister and bureaucrat H Nagesh.

While Limbavali has taken a backseat this year, the BJP is hoping to capitalise on his popularity. They also hint that Limbavali might play a national role in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections and is being considered as an MP candidate from Bengaluru Central, the constituency currently represented by P C Mohan.

Congress candidate Nagesh is an incumbent MLA from the Mulbagal constituency in Kolar district. A former BESCOM (Bangalore Electricity Supply Company) official, he won the 2018 polls as an Independent, defeating JD(S)’s Samruddhi Manjunath by 6,000 votes. After the polls, he extended his support to the Congress-JD (S) government led by H D Kumaraswamy and held the Small Scale Industries portfolio in the one-year coalition government.

After the BJP came to power in 2019, he allied with the party and was made the Skill Development, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood Minister in the B S Yediyurappa-led government. He joined the Congress in January 2023, ahead of the coming polls.

Both Limbavali and Nagesh have faced corruption allegations. In September 2022, Limbavali also faced controversy over a video of him threatening a woman in his Mahadevapura constituency. Citizen groups and lake activists have repeatedly accused Limbavali of allowing illegal settlements, unauthorised buildings, and lake buffer zone violations within constituency limits.

In case of Nagesh, in 2020, the daughter of the excise joint commissioner Mohan Raj, M Sneha, had written to the Prime Minister’s Office alleging that the minister had sought Rs 1 crore in bribe to clear her father’s transfer. She said Nagesh had transferred at least 600 officials similarly, a charge the MLA denies.

For residents of Mahadevapura, especially the large migrant population that has settled in the area over the last decade, the elections are primarily premised on the developmental work that is yet to be undertaken.

The monsoon showers in September and October last year, for example, left many parts of Mahadevapura inundated with water for weeks. Water logging incidents were reported in 136 apartment complexes in Varthur, Belathur, Hoodi, Doddakannelli, Kadugodi, Garudacharpalya, Sarjapur Road and Doddenakundi.

Metro work underway on the Outer Ring Road causes traffic jams for hours. The Outer Ring Road Companies Association (ORRCA) that represents 70 member companies within the Mahadevapura constituency has demanded a separate municipal zone, to amend the “broken infrastructure” in the region.

Raghu D, a Varthur resident said, “In the past seven to eight years, the pace of civic works has been very slow. Limbavali, who has been our MLA for 15 years now, has done half-baked work. The monsoon rains threw our life out of gear for a week because the civic agencies had not done its work. Moreover, a lot of drains have been encroached upon, which has resulted in blockage of drains, resulting in floods. Illegal settlements in Varthur have impeded several developmental works, including the long standing road widening project.”

Prasad M, another resident of Varthur and an IT professional, said the constituency lacked basic facilities. “Mahadevapura has grown up exponentially. This constituency is the highest GST-paying constituency as part of residential apartment maintenance. Despite all this, we lack basic facilities like good roads, drainage systems, street lights, public transport, among other facilities. In addition, Limbavali is not able to execute developmental works in the region as there is no synergy between civic agencies. Limbavali’s wife does not represent any change. But the Congress candidate is yet to reach out to more people in the region.”

Speaking of the 51 lakes within the constituency, activist Sandeep Anirudhan said: “Until Cauvery river water dries up, nobody will make lakes a poll issue. There is very little awareness among people, the civic authorities and political representatives about ecology and the importance of lakes.”

Nearly 15% of the voters in the constituency are SC voters, who make the bulk of the population. This is followed by STs, Vokkaligas, and Muslims.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Unlike Mumbai, why did this coastal city's infrastructure fail? - Infrastructure News","Chennai is submerged under rainfalls and heavy disruptions caused by the cyclone ‘Michaung’. It is the fourth cyclone developed in the Bay of Bengal this year. The city witnessed a shutdown, with local transport facilities coming to a halt, and the air traffic blocked, considering the storm caused by the cyclone. Even though the cyclone has now reached Andhra Pradesh, it is a repetitive question regarding the infrastructure of Chennai, the fifth largest city in India and the home to 6.7 million people, failing to be prepared for floods and water-logging.

Climate

Chennai, one of the oldest urban centres of the country, has three rivers, and 7 lakes in the vicinity of a 100-km radius, and still faces water-logging every year. The city is one of the wettest in the state and receives around 1400mm of rainfall annually. The majority of the rainfall experienced by the city is during the North East monsoon between October and December.

Day Zero

Unfortunately, the same city experienced day zero in 2019, when all four reservoirs of the city went dry after three consecutive dry monsoons in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Tamil Nadu had a forest cover of just 20 per cent of the total area in 2015. That remained constant at just 20.31 per cent, according to the ISFR reports published biennially.

Population burden

The rapid urbanisation of the city and a population blast over the last few decades witnessed the population of the city expanding from 53.5 lakhs in 1991 to 1.19 crores in 2023, which has stressed the water resources available in the city. Factors such as good education, jobs and opportunities attract mass migration to the city.

The population density in Chennai is over 26,000 people per square kilometre as per the 2011 population census, as compared to just over a thousand in smaller cities such as Kanyakumari. This has increased with time.

Failed Drainage system

Deforestation to accommodate a large influx of people is a very common factor. But this population has hampered the drainage system of the city. The City is drained by 2 rivers besides several major & minor drains through Buckingham Canal into the Sea via Ennore Creek, Cooum Mouth, Adyar Mouth and Kovalam Creek.

Some of the reasons for several floods quoted several times by the authorities in the reports include the flow of untreated sewage, Disposal of solid waste and construction debris, slums in the flood plains directly feeding sewage and solid waste, etc. causing low flood discharge.

Bengaluru

All builders have to henceforth display the building plan approved by the Town Planning Department (TPD) at under-construction sites in flood-prone Mahadevapura zone in Bengaluru. This was mandated by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Zonal Joint Commissioner (JC) after a meeting with Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs). The fresh order was passed on July 1.

The September 2022 floods put the spotlight on violations by builders in the zone. The BBMP found realtors encroaching on storm water drains, buffer zones, and revenue land. Due to the violations, during rains, water entered layouts, apartments, roads, parking areas in the basement, and homes.

While the BBMP’s anti-encroachment drive is under way, multiple builders and residents have secured stay orders from the court, putting hurdles before the civic body. Now, the BBMP wants to focus on deviation and violation of law both during plan approval, and after.

Sources in the civic body said there is a huge clamour among citizens in Mahadevapura zone, which was worst affected by floods, to look into violations by officials while approving building plans. In this connection, the JC met RWAs who urged the BBMP to direct builders to display the approved plan so that buyers will have a clear idea before making a purchase, and defaulting builders can be taken to task.

The sources further said the Town Planning Department had given permission to many builders to erect structures despite violations. Without displaying the plan, no citizen can detect the deviations.

With the new order to display the sanctioned building plan, the system can be streamlined. The order states: “The owners have to display an approved map from TPD, building plan at the construction site.”

Tushar Giri Nath, Chief Commissioner, BBMP said, “This is not a new rule. Although the BBMP had in the past directed builders to display maps, many of them were not adhering to the rules. Hence, such orders are passed time and again to remind them.”

With the fresh order, if any violation is found in the approved plan or map, Additional Director Town Planning Department will be made responsible. If any deviation is done by the builder during construction, local engineers will be taken to task.

For instance, in the approved plan, if permission is given for five floors, but builder builds six, the Assistant Executive Engineer will be held accountable.

According to one builder, while upright real estate developers will not fear displaying the approved plan, defaulters will be caught red-handed if this order is implemented. Also, this may lead to blackmailing by officials. The BBMP has to ensure that only defaulting builders are penalised, he said.",solution,Bengaluru Floods 2022,"Bengaluru, India",September 2022,September 2022,Mahadevapura zone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

While it isn't rare to witness floods in Mumbai, an unprecedented amount of rains caused unusual flooding in even Bengaluru and Delhi earlier this year. The streets in Bengaluru in May 2023 were inundated due to the monsoon rains. The floods even caused deaths and prompted rescue missions for those stuck in their cars or homes. Many videos went viral where people could literally swim in their homes and on the streets.

Another such incident of unusual flooding due to torrential rains has surfaced, and it's not an Indian city but the New York City of the US. Several videos have surfaced on social media from the flash floods in New York, resembling scenes from Bengaluru or Mumbai. The streets, stores, and even the Subway stations were heavily flooded, causing havoc and major disruption for New Yorkers.

Governor Kathy Hochul of New York has declared a State of Emergency due to flash flooding causing widespread chaos across New York City, all brought on by heavy rainfall hammering the northeastern US. Mayor Eric Adams has also requested New Yorkers to stay home or seek shelter.

Brooklyn has been severely affected by the rising water levels, evident in alarming videos displaying flooded streets and subways. The MTA, responsible for running the city's transit system, reported numerous power outages and delays.

A severe storm remained stationed over the city and extended to parts of upstate New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, prompting extensive flood watches and warnings.

The New York area could witness an unprecedented volume of rain, with two to five inches already recorded in certain areas since midnight.

Many parts of Bengaluru, especially its information technology (IT) corridor on the K. R. Puram–Sarjapur Road axis, got flooded during the heavy rain in September 2022, putting the city in the headlines again for the wrong reasons. Last year’s floods are playing on the minds of voters this election season and MLAs seem to be facing a strong anti-incumbency factor in pockets that were inundated.

The strongest acknowledgement of this came from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) when it denied the ticket to its three-time MLA Arvind Limbavali from the Mahadevapura constituency, which houses the IT corridor and suffered the most in the 2022 floods. “The party’s internal surveys showed Mr. Limbavali was facing strong anti-incumbency, especially after last year’s floods and his chances of victory again were slim. But in a scenario where senior leaders such as Jagadish Shettar defected, we compromised and gave the ticket to his wife,” said a senior BJP leader from the city. However, multiple voters from the constituency The Hindu spoke to are not happy with the possibility of Mr. Limbavali trying to rule by proxy.

Ajit Sequeira from Whitefield Rising said floods are definitely on the minds of voters in the constituency, but rather than discussing the micro issues such as drains and encroachments, the Million Voters Rising Citizen Manifesto they have released demands a separate municipal corporation for Mahadevapura, which, they argue, will help address the systemic problem better.

Jagadish Reddy from Varthur Rising said that for the first time, people had begun asking questions about the “all-pervading” corruption that allowed encroachments and resulted in floods. V. Ramprasad, a lake conservation activist, said during his interaction with communities affected by floods, people had begun to ask the right questions — if they knew this was the lowest point in the area, it was flood-prone or it was encroached upon, they wouldn’t have bought this property. “All these questions point to the systemic corruption at the top of which sit the MLAs. So there is a lot of anti-incumbency against MLAs in pockets affected by floods,” he said.

When Sai Layout got flooded in September 2022, local MLA and Urban Development Minister Byrathi Basavaraj faced public anger in front of television cameras, embarrassing him and prompting him to promise the issue would be resolved before the elections. “No permanent corrective measures have been initiated in the area and come another rain it will mostly be flooded again. We are tired of complete apathy by the political class to our problems,” said Rajashekhar, a resident of K.R. Puram. Similarly, incumbent MLAs Satish Reddy, S.R. Vishwanath, and K. Gopalaiah from Bommanahalli, Yelahanka, and Mahalakshmi Layout, respectively, are facing anti-incumbency from pockets that were flooded last year.

However, the ruling BJP is trying to negate the anti-incumbency over floods claiming that they are the first to give good funding for the redevelopment of storm-water drains (SWDs) and has promised to install sluice gates in all lakes of the city, which will eventually prevent flooding. Post the floods in 2022, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who also holds the charge of Bengaluru development, directed officials to prepare a master plan of SWDs and increased funding for their ongoing redevelopment. He announced a ₹3,000-crore World Bank-assisted project to mitigate the impact of climate change in the city.

While data shows that Mr. Bommai provided funds for the redevelopment of 195 km of SWDs in 2022, the highest in any single year, it also displays a pattern where governments have been forced into action on the redevelopment of SWDs and clearing their encroachments after every flooding but the work slows down later. For instance, the redevelopment of SWDs and encroachment clearance drive first picked up pace when the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government was in power in 2016, following floods in many parts of the city that year; the work slowed down and again picked up pace in 2022 after another round of floods. However, experts argue that not only the SWD encroachment clearance drives, which are active in spurts, are an eyewash mostly, but the survey identifying encroachments itself is vastly incomplete. Meanwhile, there are also allegations against MLAs that the encroachment clearance drive has been very selective.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Bengaluru, known as the country's tech capital, has been facing criticism for its inadequate infrastructure, traffic issues, and flooding. It is also a facing tough competition from Hyderabad, its neighboring city, which is wooing tech companies there. In fact, local civil society groups in Bengaluru have been vocal about the city's deteriorating infrastructure over the years.

In an effort to involve citizens in Bengaluru's transformation, the state government has invited opinions and suggestions in seven categories: agility, cleanliness, green initiatives, vibrancy, health, technology, and satisfaction.

The public can visit brandbengaluru.karnataka.gov.in or contact the WhatsApp number 9480685700 to provide their suggestions until June 30, 2023.

However, on Wednesday morning, several citizens reported difficulties accessing the website and submitting their suggestions.

Deputy chief minister and Bengaluru development minister DK Shivakumar, who recently met industry leaders, announced plans to create a master plan for Bengaluru within six months.

During the meeting, several suggestions were made, including expediting Metro and suburban rail projects, accelerating the Peripheral Ring Road construction, converting NICE Road into a ring road, building tunnel roads, satellite cities, etc., to reduce traffic congestion.

Meanwhile, the state government has reconstituted a committee led by former chief secretary BS Patil, with former BBMP Commissioner Siddaiah and former Bangalore Agenda Task Force (BATF) member V Ravichandar as members. This committee, which previously recommended splitting the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) into multiple corporations in 2018, has been tasked with implementing the recommendations to improve the quality of life for citizens, strengthen the Brand Bengaluru, and enhance governance and administration for better citizen-centric services.

In the past, the Bengaluru Agenda Task Force (BATF) was formed in 1999 by the then Chief Minister SM Krishna, and later in 2010, Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa established the Agenda for Bengaluru Infrastructure and Development. However, subsequent governments did not form any task forces for Bengaluru.

During a meeting with Shivakumar, notable individuals such as Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw of Biocon, Kris Gopalakrishnan, co-founder of Infosys, Geetanjali Kirloskar, chairperson and MD of Kirloskar Systems, Irfan Razack, chairman and MD of Prestige Group, Nikhil Kamath, co-founder of Zerodha, MR Jaishankar, chairman of Brigade Enterprises, Raja Bagmane of Bagmane Developers, Arun K Chittilappilly, MD of Wonderla Holidays, Revathy Ashok, CEO of B.PAC, and urban planner V Ravichandar were present.

According to a traffic index published by Dutch location technology specialist TomTom in February 2022, Bengaluru ranked as the second-most congested city globally. The report stated that commuters took an average of 29 minutes and 10 seconds to cover a 10 km stretch in the city center last year, with an average speed of 18 kmph during peak hours in the central business district (CBD).

In January 2023, the Supreme Court cited Bengaluru, India's tech capital, as an example of haphazard urban development while cautioning the Chandigarh administration against thoughtless construction.

53,1131,bangalore,2022,https://india.mongabay.com/2022/09/bengaluru-floods/,23 Sept 2022,"As Bengaluru loses lakes, green cover, impact of urban floods takes a toll","Encroachment of lakes, tanks and drains, poor planning of drainage systems and lack of regulation of floodplains have exposed Bengaluru to the threat of urban flooding, say experts.

Multiple studies and reports have highlighted the vulnerability of the city to urban flooding. A 2017 study said that Bengaluru has lost 88 percent of its vegetation and 79 percent of its water bodies in 45 years.

Government data claims that the city earlier had a total of 260 lakes in 1940s which came down to 65 till now.

India’s Information Technology (IT) hub, Bengaluru, was recently in the limelight as it struggled to cope up with the recent urban floods triggered by the incessant rains in the last week of August and first week of September this year.

With a 131.6 millimeter rain in September this year, breaking records of the last 34 years, several IT parks in areas like Eco Space and other residential areas along Outer Ring Road, Bellandur, Marathahalli, Sarjapur and Mahadevapura were inundated with stormwater for days.

But what led to this large-scale stagnation of flood waters in parts of India’s fifth most populous urban agglomeration? Experts working on urban issues, lakes and flood management said that unabated urbanisation, large scale loss of green cover, encroachment of lakes, tanks and drains and lack of attention towards conserving and regulating floodplains of water bodies have increased the threat of urban flooding. According to the disaster risk map of the city, Bengaluru has a total of 134 flood prone points in different parts of the city.

Now referred to as the Silicon Valley of India, because of its booming IT and startup businesses, Bengaluru was once also known as the “City of Lakes”. This moniker referred to the lakes and tanks which were made during the regime of earlier rulers and the British to cater to agricultural and other needs of the local population of Bengaluru. However, increased urbanisation has seemed to have changed the local landscape of the city which is even evident publicly through satellite images of the city. The Master Plan of 2015, prepared by the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) claimed that the city once had 400 lakes but with the passage of time government data claimed that it was reduced to 260 by the 1940s and now has come down to 65.

The city of lakes owing to the undulating terrain of the city had a plethora of lakes that were inter-connected with a system of canals/drains called as (kaluve) which ensured transfer of excess water from one lake to another. Although the city lacks a perennial river, the tributaries of Kaveri river such as Arkavathi, Pinakini/Pennar and Shimsha take the excess water from the city lakes and drainage system to the Kaveri river. However, several experts and studies have pointed out the encroachments of the lakes and drainage system leading to interference in the city drainage system.

T.V. Ramachandra, Coordinator, Energy and Wetland Research Group

and Convenor at the Environmental Information system, Indian Institiute of Science (IISc) is one of the researchers in Bengaluru who has worked extensively on the issue of floods in the city. His research paper titled Frequent Floods in Bangalore: Causes and Remedial Measure, published in August 2017, co-authored by Bharath Aithal (IIT-Kharagpur) and Vinay Shivamurthy (SR University, Warangal) sheds light on the issue of degradation of the city and its water bodies and its impact.

His study claimed that between 1973 to 2017, the urban areas of Greater Bangalore grew by 1028 percent. The report claimed 88 percent decline in total vegetation cover and 79 percent decline in water bodies (wetlands) during the same period on account of increased concretisation of urban areas owing to cascading urbanisation. Greater Bangalore refers to the areas of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (Bengaluru’s municipal corporation) and nearby areas including eight urban local bodies and 111 villages under urban Bengaluru. It was notified in 2006.

He told Mongabay-India, “One is we need to accept that global warming is real and changes in climate are happening. We are witnessing high intensity rainfall and we also are receiving a large quantity of water in shorter duration of time. Second is the unplanned and irresponsible urban planning. We have choked up the city with concrete. If we have more concrete in a landscape we see less infiltration of water as a large quantum of water then flows on the land which is around 40%-45%.”

He also added that in the 1800s the city had 1452 water bodies; now it has 193 water bodies. He also questioned the state government’s remodeling model of city drains, which he alleged added more problems to flood mitigation measures. “Every time when budgets are announced to remodel the drains which is nothing but more concretisation of the drains. Natural drains help in the hydrological process of water like recharging the groundwater. So more we concretise drains at the cost of government money we tend to also act towards reducing the groundwater levels in the city too. So with redevelopment of drains, the width of drains is getting reduced. So they are becoming more prone to floods.”

According to the geographical map of Bengaluru the city lies in a valley. There are three major watershed regions along the valleys towards which the excess rains during monsoons tend to flow. These include Vrishabhavathi, Koramangala-Challaghatta (KC) and Hebbal. KC Valley lies towards the eastern part of the city and is said to host a number of residential areas and also the largest lakes like Bellandur and IT hubs like Eco Space. It is also close to the Tamil Nadu border and Kaveri river. During the recent floods, the KC Valley and nearby area Mahadevapura were majorly affected.

Nagesh Aras, a Bengaluru-based environmentalist and a core member of Friends of Lakes, an environmental group, told Mongabay-India that the flooding of Bengaluru is due to the lack of hydrological planning. He explained that a century ago, the city was small and did not use any groundwater or Kaveri river water at all as the rainwater was locally captured for use. But in the last three decades, as the city has grown, the increasing water demand has been met through water from the Kaveri river and by extracting groundwater as well. As a result, there is an increase in the surface water flow (rainwater and sewage). Aras claimed that the ancient drainage system is now totally inadequate to handle this flow.

“Bengaluru’s old sewerage network was not designed to carry treated sewage at all. The network’s capacity falls short by 1400 MLD (million litres per day), which one of the reasons for the flooding. Almost 90% of the tree cover of the city was lost in the last four decades, and the soil was replaced by concrete surfaces and asphalt roads which cannot absorb water. This results in a large amount of runoff water. Further, this water runs much faster on concrete and asphalt as compared to soil. That means the water rushes much faster down the gradient, and causes flash floods,” he told Mongabay-India.

He also added, “If we want to use the lakes as buffer tanks to mitigate the flood, those lakes must have large holding capacity and sluice gates to regulate the outflow. But most of the lakes are silted, and they don’t have sluice gates. Besides, many of the lakes are bypassed, which means that the lake cannot play the role of buffer tank at all. The floodwater simply rushes around the lake to the downstream area. The Outer Ring Road (ORR) lies across the KC valley, so rainwater has to flow across the ORR at a few places. But the ORR blocks this water because there is no culvert. This leads to localised flooding,”

History of judicial intervention

Bengaluru’s lakes play a crucial role in flood mitigation. One of the biggest lakes is Bellandur which receives drainage from three other upstream lakes and discharges its excess water into Varthur lake which ultimately drains the city’s excess waters towards Tamil Nadu into the Pinakini river basin.

In 1985 the Lakshman Rau Committee, formed by the Karnataka government to suggest measures to protect lakes, recommended conserving the traditional tanks, removing encroachments and desilting lakes.

However, the ground reality is far from what the Rau Committee recommended. A 2017 IISc report talked about several areas in Bengaluru where there were legal and illegal encroachments – apartments, playgrounds, markets and more – over tanks, lakes and large drains.

Since 2008, Leo Saldanha, Coordinator of Environment Support Group (ESG) had filed several cases before the Karnataka High Court (HC) requesting intervention to save lakes in Bengaluru. The HC eventually appointed a Commission, headed by Justice N.K. Patil to look into the matter and to recommend remedial measures.

The Patil Commission in their 64-page-report titled Preservation of Lakes in the City of Bangalore submitted in 2011 claimed that while farmlands in Bengaluru were converted into built up areas, many lakes were converted into residential areas and playgrounds. According to the report, areas of the Outer Ring Road, such as Agara, Ibbalur, Mahadevapura and Nagavara, which faced floods in September 2022, were built on lake areas. It also noted that the BDA converted many lake sites into residential areas like Agara, Saneguruvanahalli, Chikkamarenahalli, Kacharkanahalli, Geddalahalli, and Chelkere. The report batted for a 30-meter buffer zone for lakes where no construction should take place.

The High Court, in its final court order, accepted the recommendations of the commission and in 2012 ordered the state government to undertake survey of all lakes, ensure buffer zone of 30 meters, remove unauthorised encroachment over lakes, conduct regular desilting of lakes, rejuvenate lakes and stop flow of sewage into lakes. However, in 2015, Bellandur lake had witnessed froth and foam on its surface – a sign of pollution due to sewage waste – which even caught fire.

Saldanha said that despite him and others moving to courts, the alleged negligence of the government towards conserving lakes showed no proper work on the ground. “When wetlands are destroyed there is a major threat of flooding. The reality on the ground has not changed much despite several court orders and reminders to the government. We have been fighting for lake conservation since 1995. We warned of all these issues (urban flooding) long back, fought for it but nothing changed on the ground due to the bureaucracy. Corporates are also responsible for the current condition here. A lot of corporate players from across the country and around the globe invested to intrude into the Bengaluru wetlands and are equally responsible for the present conditions,” Saldanha told Mongabay-India.

Similar cases have been filed before the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The NGT in its order also asked the government in 2015 to ensure a 75-metre buffer zone for lakes against the existing 30 metre norms. But the order was challenged before the Supreme Court later.

During the floods in Bengaluru this year, Raj Bhagat, a geoanalyst working with the World Resources Institute (WRI)-India, used satellite images to compare the changed urban landscape of the city, over time, showing the degrading drains, increased encroachments and loss of wetlands.

He told Mongabay-India that the city administration has not given importance to the floodplains of the existing lakes as it has not demarcated the sensitive zones to prevent construction. Floodplains of water bodies like lakes and rivers play a key role in absorbing the excess water during monsoons and prevent floods. “In the Master Plan 0f 2015, prepared by the BDA there is no flood zonation mark. We have a smaller buffer zone but no scientific demarcation of flood zones. If there is no demarcation by the government we cannot even call such structures on the floodplains as illegal. It seems the government has not given much attention on the issue and on the protection of the valleys in the city. And this is not the problem of Bengaluru alone. A lot of urban flooding in other bigger cities are also arising out of similar issues. The whole issue is related to urban planning and governance,” he said.

A recent report by the Administrative Training Institute (ATI), Mysore, a state owned institution that imparts training to government officials and provides technical assistance in state disaster management plans, also batted for flood zone mapping and demarcation and urban development to mitigate floods in Bengaluru. The report said that without any regulations, some urban structures have come up on these flood plains and it would be tough to disturb them, but the time is ripe to make these regulations and discourage future construction on sensitive floodplains of lakes.

The report advocated that any areas around water bodies which are likely to be affected by floods in 10 years should be reserved for gardens, parks and playgrounds only and no buildings should be constructed in such zones. In areas likely to be flooded in 25 years should be allowed to have restricted buildings with certain conditions like number of stilts, minimum plinth level, prohibition of construction of basements among others.

The ORRCA represents all major IT and banking companies on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) stretch.

“It is estimated that more than half a million professionals are employed along the Outer Ring Road (ORR) between Central Silk Board and K.R.Puram corridor and with various support services and indirect employment, this corridor which measures about 17 kms is providing employment close to one million people,” the letter read.

“ORR IT generates revenue of $22 Billion per annum (32% of Bengaluru’s revenue) and is the highest tax contributor, however the lack of focus on development of the infrastructure in this corridor is appalling,” the letter added.

The letter said “poor infrastructure on this corridor, however, is bringing down the efficiency and productivity of the companies and putting employee safety and well-being at risk”.

“Flooding on ORR on August 30 has led to a loss of Rs 225 crores as staff were stuck on the road for more than 5 hours. Inadequate infrastructure on ORR has now reached a crisis level. Even though only 30% of ORR population has returned to working from office, the collapse of the infrastructure has drawn global concern on the city of Bengaluru’s ability to handle further growth. Member companies have made a substantial investment on the ORR,” the letter read.

“In addition, member companies had to trigger emergency Business continuity plans and work from home or pass on critical work to locations outside of Bengaluru and Karnataka, thus causing reputational and economic damage to the city and the State. This situation continues for the past 3 days and beyond,” the letter added.

The ORRCA also pointed out in the letter that the government should come up with short-term and mid-term plans in order to address the infrastructural issues.

“It is in the collective interest of ORRCA and the government that Bengaluru infrastructure issues are addressed with a short midterm and longer-term view to sustain the growth, as these companies will seek alternate destinations if the situation does not improve,” the letter said.

While the government took up the desilting work of Bellandur and Varthur lakes in June 2020, that work is yet to be completed.

Loss of interconnectivity between lakes

Dr T V Ramachandra, from the Centre for Ecological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), says that loss of interconnectivity among lakes in the region is the major reason behind the flooding.

In 1800, Bangalore (740 sq km region) had 1,452 water bodies with the water storage capacity of 35 TMC (thousand million cubic feet), which helped in optimally harvesting rainwater and also mitigated flooding.

“Today we have 193 lakes and most of them have lost connectivity due to blocking of rajakaluves (storm water drains) with solid waste or because of encroachment. Lakes and their beds are also being encroached. The silt deposited in the lakes also reduces the water holding capacity of the lakes,” he said.

Catchment alterations

Bengaluru has the distinction of having inter connected lake systems. Valley zones connecting the lakes are to be protected to ensure the continuation of hydrological functions of the drains and flood plains. However, valley zones in the city continue to be abused despite norms to protect these fragile ecosystems.

“Bellandur-Varthur wetland ecosystem has been experiencing threat due to the large scale catchment alterations with changes in the land use, land cover. This wetland is now being converted for mixed land use to build both residential and office complexes. Alterations in the wetland began in 2004 and aggravated post 2008. The alterations of these wetlands were initiated by filling the low lying areas with excavated earth debris, followed by other construction activities. The land fillings have breached both drains and lakes,” Ramachandra said.

The upstream lakes to Bellandur and Varthur, which include Kaikondrahalli and Saul Kere, are also overflowing due to the rampant encroachments of storm water drains.

Ramachandra added that his study found that the storm water drain connecting Bellandur lake from the city market side was narrowed to 28.5 m against the original width of 60 m.

Also, a 2021 audit report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) said that the stormwater drain department does not maintain records like work registers or the progress reports of works. It also said that BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) failed to factor in high intensity rainfall amid rapid urbanisation and did not adhere to the provisions of Indian Road Congress and the guidelines of National Disaster Management Authority while designing and constructing roads/drains. “Ground water recharge structures were not taken up due to flow of sewage in SWDs. Water bodies and drains were not inter-connected and linkage between different drains was absent. This affected free flow of stormwater leading to frequent flooding in various parts of the city,” the report said.

Failure to desilt

Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) in June 2020 had commenced the desilting at Bellandur and Varthur lakes. Officials say that due to the pandemic the work was stopped and was resumed again in January 2021. In April 2021, the work was again discontinued.

Varthur Lake warden Jagadish Reddy said, “The desilting, whatever has happened till now, indeed improved the water retention capacity of Varthur lake. The desilting at Bellandur lake was stopped in March and at Varthur it was stopped in April. The problem is that there are more than 90 lakes in this series of the lakes of which Varthur and Bellandur are part of. Most of these lakes and drains in this series are either encroached or not desilted leading to flooding.”

Bangalore Development Authority officials say that the desilting of these lakes will take another one year. “The desilting at these two lakes was supposed to be completed in August this year. One of the major reasons in the delay of desilting is the identification of the area where the silt has to be deposited….The silt was initially given even to the farmers to be used as manure. Moreover, in this heavy rain it is not possible to carry out desilting,” the official said.

Heavy rains that lashed parts of the city on Friday night, especially Mahadevapura and Yelahanka zones, unleashed havoc in its wake. Areas in K.R. Puram, which suffered the maximum damage during the May 16-17 rains, again bore the brunt of heavy rains on Friday night.

Horamavu (146.5 mm) and K.R. Puram (127.5 mm) recorded the highest rainfall in the State on Friday, mostly between 9 p.m. and 11.30 p.m.. During the May 16-17 rains too, Horamavu recorded the highest rainfall.

Several apartments were flooded in K.R. Puram, with water stagnating in basements damaging hundreds of cars and bikes. Residents deploying motors to pump out water was a common sight in the area on Saturday. In another incident, over 20 bikes parked near a theatre were damaged as a compound wall collapsed over it on Friday night.

The BBMP said nearly 400 houses in Sai Layout, Gururaja Layout, Pai Layout and other adjoining areas in K.R. Puram, which were flooded during the May 16-17 rains, were flooded again with knee-deep water. “The area has water above the knee again. All the ground floor houses are submerged. As usual, all electrical appliances are under water. There is no electricity from Friday night. Now there is a sense of deja vu with every rain,” said John, a resident of Sai Layout.

“The BDA is widening a drain under the railway underpass at Sai Layout, which will solve flooding in the area. We will soon find a permanent solution and till then, it is tough to avoid water logging in the area,” said BBMP Commissioner Tushar Giri Nath.

Urban Development Minister and K.R. Puram MLA Byrathi Basavaraj, who visited the flood-hit areas, faced the ire of residents who complained that no preventive measures were taken to prevent floods after the May 16 incident. Mr. Basavaraj assured them that interventions to prevent flooding were already set into motion and all works would be completed by March 2023.

Meanwhile, Singapura lake, near Vidyaranyapura, overflowed and this led to the compound wall of an apartment complex — Commanders’ Glory — to collapse flooding the complex. “Water gushed into the apartment complex and this caused the compound wall to collapse. There was knee-deep water on Saturday morning. Now the water inflow has stopped after the civic body brought in a JCB and put a block to stop the flow from the lake,” said Anil, a resident of the apartment complex.

BHPian vidyanand recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

Anyone in Bangalore contemplating getting an XUV 7OO instead of Virtus GT after the water situation?

My Situation

So I have been running my 2013 i20 so far and will continue to keep it. Sent my 2008 i10 to my parents a few years back as an additional vehicle and is used occasionally when more members gather. Both times in past settled for reliability against power (in my budget).

As the 10th year started for my i20, had this itch to somehow upgrade to a powerful Sedan so chose Virtus GT (still in waiting). XUV 7OO also serves the power need and can stretch the budget but that killing wait time simply removed it from consideration. Better to have a fun car now rather than wait for 1 year for the extras that XUV has. Also did not consider any other CSUVs as I prefer Sedans.

BUT suddenly this water situation in Bangalore has had me thinking if I should better get an SUV (very specifically XUV 7OO). Because if I get the Virtus now, I would not be getting a big car/SUV for some time in this price range. So wanted to see if a few other forum members have this change of thoughts and maybe some suggestions on these two.

Some other idea that I can't predict for now is to get the Virtus now and later replace the i20 with Thar (love it) to take care of the water wading.

Here's what BHPian TechnoBloop had to say about the matter:

With all due respect to the XUV 700, by the time you get the car, most probably the roads will be repaired! So I guess Thar would be a better option? On a side note, the roads in Bangalore are in a really bad situation, I hope it improves soon!

Here's what BHPian vijaykr had to say about the matter:

Given the extent of flooding in specific pockets in the city, it might not make a difference whether you have a sedan or SUV. Also, I'm sure you realise these extreme rains are for a few days/weeks in a year only. So if I were you, I'd pick the car that tugs at your heart. All the best for your next ride.

Here's what BHPian bijims had to say about the matter:

Stay with VW Virtus GT, it's a great fun-to-drive sedan and has got most of the bases covered, you will get it much earlier than the XUV700 too.

Here's what BHPian k491 had to say about the matter:

The flood situation is not as bad as everyone (news and social media) makes it seem. Areas which are built on closed lakes are facing that issue, Bangalore ORR and nearby areas. Without getting too political about the matter, there is no quick solution for that matter as the water simply doesn't have anywhere to go. If I were you I would just go for Virtus, it's a far more pleasurable car to drive and easier to navigate the horrendous Bangalore traffic.

BMRCL clears debris of retaining wall

Hours after the retaining wall and metal fencing collapsed at Seshadripuram, the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) deployed a team to clear the debris.

Several vehicles were damaged when the wall collapsed.

Kishore Kumar, whose car was near the wall, said that his vehicle was completely damaged. After calling up various authorities for several hours, some officials removed the vehicles stuck under debris. “This shows that the quality of construction of the retaining wall was poor. My car is completely damaged and needs a lot of repair work,” he added.

Heavy rainfall during the last week of August and first week of September brought Bengaluru to a standstill. Flooding of offices and houses, traffic bottlenecks and power outages were recorded across the Silicon Valley of India. On August 27, the Bengaluru-Mysuru Highway was inundated with flood water after the Inorapalya lake breached the banks. Three days later, the outer ring road was flooded as water from Savalakere lake overflowed.

While the Bengaluru floods made headlines in recent days, the monsoon season has claimed many lives and damaged several public and private properties across the State this year. As many as 96 lives were lost since June, crops in 5.8 lakh hectares of land were lost, 1,471 bridges and 2,223 km of roads were damaged. In total, the estimated losses amounted to ₹7,647 crore.

A recent phenomenon

In the last two decades, the number of lives lost to floods have sharply increased in the State. In the last decade (2011-20) and the one before (2001-10), Karnataka’s share in India’s flood-related deaths ranged between 7-8%. In the 2000s, the State had the fourth highest share of flood-related deaths among major States. In the last decade, it had the seventh-highest share.

In contrast, in the decades before 2000s, Karnataka’s share was negligible. The State’s share in India’s flood-related deaths ranged between 0-3% in all the previous decades. Table 1lists a State’s share in India’s total deaths due to flood in each decade. For instance, Gujarat formed 10% of the total fatalities in the 2001-10 period, and 8% in the last decade (2011-20).

Across all decades, Uttar Pradesh’s share has consistently been 17% or above. West Bengal, Gujarat and Bihar also accounted for a high share in India’s flood-related fatalities in most decades.

The above trends have to be read with caution, given the wide variation in States’ population. Also the numbers were for undivided Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar.

Unique pattern

Table 2 lists the decadal share of a State’s total flood-related deaths in the 1953-2020 period. For instance, of all the deaths due to floods recorded in Karnataka in the period, 34% occurred in the last decade, while 39% happened in the decade before that. Similar to the trend observed in Table 1, Karnataka’s flood-related fatalities were significantly lower in the decades before the 2000s.

Infact, in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Karnataka’s share in India’s fatalities as shown in table 1 and the decadal share in State’s overall deaths as shown in table 2, were either barely present or non-existent. This reiterates the fact that Karnataka’s troubles related to floods are a recent phenomenon.

Outliers

In 1977, 11,316 lives were lost to floods — the most for any given year — of which 9,974 were lost in Andhra Pradesh. Floods damaged 39.6 lakh houses in India in 2015 — the highest number of houses destroyed due to floods in any year between 1953 and 2020.

The charts show the number of human lives lost, cattle lost and houses damaged due to floods in India each year. The highest number of flood-related deaths was recorded in 1977 (11,316), of which 9,974 lives were lost in Andhra Pradesh. Tamil Nadu accounted for 30.1 lakh of the 39.1 lakh houses damaged in 2015 — the highest number recorded in a year.

It highlights the urgent need of urban adaptation and resilience plan, say experts.An analysis done by Climate Trends highlights how Bengaluru floods were a combination of two factors-climate change and mismanagement of urban planning.""While changes in monsoon systems due to climate change led to torrential rain over the city, the situation worsened due to poor urban planning which did not let the water find its way out, eventually inundating it for days. With increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, this can be more recurrent across Indian cities, impacting lives, livelihoods and GDP,"" the analysis states.Once known as the city of lakes, Bengaluru's intense urbanisation process led to encroachment of wetlands and flood-plains, leading to floodway obstruction. ""With the loss of natural flood storage in Bengaluru, flooding had worsened by unauthorised developments along the lakes. In the wake of urbanisation, the network between the water bodies is completely broken, making them independent entities. Choked drains led to residential parts of the city being inundated. It demonstrated how unplanned, rapid urban development has stretched the natural ecosystems in and around a city to its limits, and made disaster from natural flood hazards inevitable and more destructive,"" the analysis adds.Stressing that urbanisation across the city continues to be unchecked, author of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Anjal Prakash says, ""Bengaluru is doing nothing for adaptation. Political system and will is not aligned with climate resilient policy. In fact, there has been no political stability to battle climate risk as 15 chief ministers have changed in the last 20 years.""According to the IPCC, urban climate resilient development is observed to be more effective if it is responsive to regional and local land use development and adaptation gaps, and addresses the underlying drivers of vulnerability. ""The main issue to deal with is to understand that different people in the city hold document capacities to cope with and adapt to seasonal floods. This is a deep environmental justice issue. Low-income households need safety nets to flood proof their homes. This means more inclusive and sustainable urban planning that holds penalties for those constructing and encroaching on urban wetlands."" saysChandni Singh , senior researcher and faculty member at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements.Adding that people are increasingly understanding the implications of climate change and how these events are affecting them in real time now, director of Climate Trends Aarti Khosla says, ""Climate change will not only worsen these events but compounding disasters will destabilise growth and local governments. If decision makers fail to bring an integrated, inclusive planning to India's urban development, it will not only be counterproductive to the GDP-linked development we aim for, but also lose out on investment opportunities to develop future-ready cities which have the adaptive capacity for increasing populations.""",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

In episode one of the series, Arun Pai explains how elevation determines why certain parts of Bengaluru flood. The second and third episodes in the “Floodsplaining” “series respectively explain how our ancestors captured and utilised rain water and how some locations in the city are more vulnerable to floods.

Arun Pai, founder of Bangalore Walks, uses interactive maps, history trivia, and quizzes in the video series on the Bangalore Walks’ YouTube channel, to explain in detail, the causes for floods and possible solutions. He focuses on reasons for flooding and not on who is to blame.

History matters

In episode two of the series, titled “Blr Floods-History Matters!” Arun Pai asks a quiz question: How many lakes are there in Bengaluru? The answer will give you much-needed information.

Arun Pai then goes onto provide fascinating insights, engaging viewers using maps, trivia, and quizzes, on how, over 700 years ago, our ancestors created engineering marvels to capture rain water. He also explains how Bengaluru is one of the few cities that is not located near a water source, like a river or a sea, and that its only water source is rain. Rain water does not stay in Bengaluru, it has to be captured and stored. He then visits Vibhutipura tank, in South east Bengaluru, and takes viewers on a historical journey to the time period of 1308 AD, to understand how our ancestors effectively captured and utilised rain water.

Why location is important

In episode three, titled “Location Matters! It’s about black & blue”, Arun Pai stresses that location explains why some parts of Bengaluru flood. He traces, via a topographical map, how rapid urbanisation has made some parts of the city more vulnerable to flooding.

Read more: The story of Thippagondanahalli Dam on the Arkavathi

In the 1990s, settlements were located in the ridge, which was protected from excessive flooding. However, over the last few decades, the city has expanded into the valleys, making some areas prone to flooding. This explains why Mahadevpura flooded as it is located in a valley, surrounded by high grounds on three sides.

Barely 50 metres away from the lawn over 50 luxury homes, which are part of the Epsilon Residential Villa complex in Yemalur in south-east Bengaluru, lay abandoned after flood water rose to a height of over 8 feet and even entered the first floor of many of the duplex houses.

The plush gated community is home to the likes of businessmen and top corporate managements such as Rishad Premji of Wipro Ltd, Varun Berry of Britannia Industries, Byju Raveendran of Byjus, Ashok Genomal of Page Industries (Jockey) and several other top businessmen, residents said.

The stranded families at Epsilon were all rescued and evacuated by Tuesday morning by the Fire and Rescue Services. Most of them have shifted to rented places or at the houses of their friends or relatives.

“We were evacuated on Monday evening as the water level began to rise. We have moved to a relative’s house. The Fire and Rescue Services have been the lifeline for most people in the villas,” said a senior government official and a resident of Epsilon since 2020.

They are pinning their hopes on the Fire and Rescue Services boats that were engaged in pumping out water from the colony. “Since Wednesday morning efforts have been on to pump the water out of the villas. Yet, the water level is not receding. More water seems to be entering the property. At the furthest end the water has reached the first floor. Garages which are on the ground floor have been all submerged,” said a worker at the villa complex.

It was impossible to reach Epsilon and another nearby gated community ‘Divyasree 77 degree East’ on Monday and Tuesday without jeeps, tractors or trucks as the access roads and its surrounding areas were submerged. Though the situation changed on Wednesday after the access roads became dry and motorable, the villas at Epsilon remained marooned.

“There have been minor incidents of flooding in the past but nothing like this. We have been forced out of our home and had to find other places to stay since the water began rising on Monday. This is a result of unregulated constructions on storm water drains and lake beds,” said the managing director of a services firm and member of the Epsilon owners association on condition of anonymity.

“We have not done anything illegal but new properties around us have blocked drainage systems resulting in water logging in our property,” the association member said.

Many residents have pointed out that the flooding is a consequence of the construction of a massive tech park and luxury villa complex next door. “This is a classic case of the politician-builder nexus,” an Epsilon resident said.

While the villas at Epsilon are flooded, an apartment complex which is located at a higher point in the property remains intact.

The properties at Epsilon are priced between Rs 10 crore and Rs 20 crore. The luxury property stands on the banks of the Bellandur and Yemalur lakes, which started overflowing due to the downpour in the past few days – a main reason for the flooding. Another reason is considered to be the emergence of new constructions. The overflowing water, which would normally go downstream to the Varthur Lake has seen a back flow due to the lack of drainage routes resulting in the flooding at the villas.

Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai visited the flooded Yemalur region Tuesday night but did not check on the situation at Epsilon. “It was only a photo opportunity for the Chief Minister to show that he is doing his job.

With light showers falling indue to theeffect, the Channasandra Main Road has flooded again causing major traffic congestion on the road. According to officials, it’s not due to the Dakshina Pinakini River overflowing, but due to debris obstructing the flow of water.While most of Bengaluru is not severely affected by the rains, residents living near the Channasandra bridge are struggling due to flooded roads and heavy traffic congestion. With increased rainfall in the city, the area was in trouble when the river overflowed in September. After years of being deemed to be a dead river, this year the residents of the area had to face the fury of the river in its full flow.Waterlogging on the roads started last Saturday night and became worse by Sunday. By Tuesday, the roads were flooded leading to slow movement of traffic. Residents say that covering a distance of 300 metres is taking nearly 45 minutes.A resident of the area Debanjan told BM that even for medical emergencies, citizens must wade through the water. “For medical emergencies, we need to go to the other side of the city. To rush to the hospital, people have to go to Hoskote and then get into Kadugodi. Even the last time when it was flooded, we were stranded for two days straight. Currently, the water is also filled with garbage and debris,” he added.The area is roughly 3 km fromand 4 km from ITPL Main Road. The Channasandra bridge is the link point between Bengaluru and the. Hoskote also houses warehouses of popular brands.Residents say that officials are offering no permanent solution to their woes. They had also written to the Panchayat highlighting the issue and did not receive any response.Another resident,said, “The river has not been desilted and the roads get flooded. Vehicles cannot cross the stretch. Due to this stretch,and Kadugodi also get flooded.”However, officials say that, unlike last time, the river did not overflow this time. Clement Jayakumar, General Secretary of MTF-Mobility said, “This time there is waterlogging at Channasandra bridge. Earlier, debris removed by the BBMP SWD department from Dakshina Pinakini river was left on the side of the bridge in September. Due to this, the water is not flowing into the river.

Torrential overnight rains in Bengaluru yet again bared the flaws in the city’s civic infrastructure, with major arterial roads facing flood-like situations on September 5, throwing life out of gear for the second time in a week.

Traffic movement was crippled on ORR starting from Silk Board junction to Bellandur, Marathahalli, HSR layout and Sarjapura Road, making it impossible for two-wheeler riders and four-wheelers to pass through.

At 8 am on Monday, the highest quantum of rainfall [148.50mm] was recorded at Sampangiramanagar in East Bengaluru, according to the KSNDMC website, and 66.50 mm of rain was recorded in Bengaluru Urban.

Major affected areas

Rainwater was more than three feet deep in the railway underbridges at Majestic, Okalipuram and Kasturinagar. The floodgates opened into shopping streets such as Avenue Road, BVK Iyengar Road, KG Road, and Shivajinagar.

Other affected areas due to rain include Whitefield, Gottigere, Bannerghatta Road, Vijayanagar, Rajajinagar, Basaveshwar Nagar, Yeshwantpur, Peenya, Laggere, Nandini Layout, Malleswaram, Seshadripuram, Hebbal, Sanjaynagar, RT Nagar, Nagawara, Hennur, Banaswadi, RR Nagar, Kengeri, Deepanjali Nagar.

There is a plan on how to create a temporary drain: CM Bommai

Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said he has instructed officials to see to it that water is drained out from the inundated roads at the earliest.

“There have been heavy rains in Bengaluru, I have spoken to the Commissioner [BBMP] and other officials. I have asked officials to depute two State Disaster Response Fund [SDRF] teams to Mahdevapura and Bommanahalli zones in the city that have been worst affected, with boats and other equipment..also engineers are there,” Mr. Bommai told reporters.

“There is a plan on how to create a temporary drain and how to go about it [drain out water], it will be operationalised...”he added. - PTI

ORRCA Advisory

WFH declared for techies, bank workers

Outer Ring Road Companies Association (ORRCA) has instructed almost a million tech and bank workers employed by various enterprises in the Outer Ring Road (ORR) area to work from home for the whole of this week.

“We have encouraged only 30% of the people to come to offices after the pandemic. Now with this kind of water logging and flooding situation and unbearable traffic snarls, we have asked all employees to work from home for the next five days,’‘ Krishna Kumar, General Manager, at ORRCA told The Hindu.

Meanwhile, the association has asked BBMP and the state government to do something effectively to solve the flood situation and also make traffic arrangements to ease the choking of ORR.

Kempegowda International Airport

Inclement weather conditions at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) disrupted several flight services. Six flights heading to Bengaluru from various destinations were diverted to Chennai Airport, including two international flights — an Air France flight incoming from Paris and another Lufthansa flight from Frankfur. Poor weather conditions also resulted in delayed departures. A total of nine flights, including six international flights, were delayed.

The airport received 109 mm of rainfall between 11.30 p.m and 4.00 a.m. Air passengers complained about rainwater stagnating at vehicle parking areas outside the terminal.

BWSSB release

Water supply to be disrupted on Sep 5, 6

While there is water everywhere one looks in the city, for the next two days the supply of drinking water will be affected as the Kaveri pumping station in TK Halli in Mandya district, has been inundated as a result of heavy rains. In a press release, the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) said that more than 50 areas including Malleshwaram, Seshadripuram, Indiranagar, Sadashiva Nagar, Kengeri and others will not get drinking water for two days. CM Basavraj Bommai also visited the pumping station in the afternoon.

Power supply interrupted

The heavy downpour on Sunday night led to many electrical damages in the city, causing power interruptions, especially in areas near the Outer Ring Road (ORR).

According to Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom), a power station at Kadubeesanahalli has been shut down due to waterlogging, while a couple of transformers at other places gave out. Around 15 electrical poles have broken down as trees fell on them. The station has been turned off since 4 am and the electricity supply has been affected in the nearby areas.

Following heavy rains in the city on August 30, 287 trees/branches had fallen on electrical lines and 13 transformers were damaged.

IMD forecast

IMD issues yellow warning

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned of thunderous rainfall till September 9 across Karnataka.

The most affected areas are said to be Bellandur, Sarjapura Road, Whitefield, Outer Ring Road, and BEML Layout. All commuters, especially those working in the IT corridor have been requested to avoid taking ORR.

Travel time has shot up by an average of 30% in bangalore and complaints of trees falling in the city. Two cases have been reported at Adugodi, Koramangala, and another got uprooted in Devara Jeevanahalli.

“Two pump houses had stopped functioning at TK Halli on Monday affecting the water supply to Bengaluru. There was a fear that this would affect the water supply to the city in a big way but the issue has been resolved now,” Bommai said late Tuesday night.

“A 550-MLD (million litre per day) pumphouse of the Cauvery stage-5 phase-2 water supply project has started operating again and thus a major portion of the supply is restored. A second pump for 350 MLD of water will be ready by Wednesday morning. From Wednesday onwards there will be no water problems in Bengaluru,” Bommai said.

“The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) officials have worked hard to restore the supply in a short span of time. We were anticipating a cut in water supply for two more days but the work by the engineers and others has resulted in the restoration. From tomorrow (Wednesday), normal water supply will be restored for Bengaluru. There is no need for anxiety over drinking water,” Bommai said.

The BWSSB said in a statement on Monday that more than 50 areas, including K R Puram, Seshadripuram, Sadashivanagar and Indiranagar, would not receive drinking water supplies from Tuesday due to repair work at T K Halli.

The heavy flow of water into two pump houses which pump water from Cauvery for supply to the city of Bengaluru – located nearly 90 km away – led to the disruption of drinking water supply in many parts of Bengaluru. The T K Halli pump house is located in the Malavalli Taluk of the Mandya district.

Nearly 1,450 MLD is pumped to Bengaluru from the Cauvery by five pumping stations. Two of the stations – a 550 MLD pump and a 350 MLD unit — were damaged due to inundation following flooding of the river.

Tractors and boats were used to evacuate people from homes in flooded neighbourhoods.

Bengaluru’s IT corridor was among the worst affected. Large swathes of the city were flooded, normal life was disrupted, and the apathy of the authorities raised many questions.

In search of answers

Several reasons have been cited for the flooding: from rapid and unplanned urbanisation to poor infrastructure to burgeoning population to climate change. Citizens have been trying to find answers to what caused the floods and possible solutions to protect themselves in the event of another flood. Various experts have attempted to explain the cause for Bengaluru’s recent floods. News articles, TV panels, Youtube videos, and Twitter threads have attempted to analyse the cause for the severe flooding.

Mapping the water path

Bengaluru primarily depends on rain as a water source. Arun Pai traces, via an interactive map, the flow of rain water from five different locations to Varthur Tank, the lowest point of the city, situated at a height of 865 metres above sea level, according to the video. The locations include: the highest point in the city, i.e. High Grounds near Raj Bhavan, near Cubbon Park, near Koramangala, south of Tin Factory, and east of Harlur. If anything comes in the way of the flow of the water, there is a good chance of flooding.

Following repeated instances of flooding and inundation in the city during heavy rainfall, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has now set a target to install 5,000 Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) pits in parks and roadside drains to smooth the flow of water and increase the groundwater table.

The civic body has so far installed 1,000 RWH pits in the city and set a target of constructing 5,000 more in another three years across the city. The BBMP is planning to harvest at least two crore litre of rainwater annually.

“According to experts, the city receives 600 mm to 1,000 mm rain annually and most of this rainwater gets wasted flowing into drains. Hence, the BBMP is installing RWH pits in parks and various places in the city which will contribute to the increase in groundwater,” a BBMP officer from the horticulture department said.

“The RWH pits not only raise the underground water table in the city, but also this ingenious method will also ensure adequate water supply to trees with shorter roots in BBMP parks,” he added.

The civic body says that the RWH pits are been installed with the help of various non-government organisations and under the Corporate Social Responsibilities programme scientifically. “We are now digging a 12-foot-deep RWH pit, which includes concrete rings, iron meshes and covering slabs at around the cost of ₹35,000 to ₹40,000,” the officer explained.

BBMP is already started implementing the project in phase by phase manner and last month, in the Basavanagudi assembly constituency, the civic body called a tender for implementing the RWH pits at the cost of ₹8.79 crore.

According to BBMP, there are around four lakh RWH pits across the city, however, the BBMP has no data on how many are in good condition.",solution,Bengaluru Floods 2022,"Bengaluru, India","October 22, 2022",TBD,"['Basavanagudi', 'Jayanagar', 'Koramangala', 'BTM Layout', 'Sarjapur Road', 'Whitefield']","600 mm to 1,000 mm",TBD,TBD,TBD,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Flash floods reported across city play havoc with daily lives of Bengalureans; despite repeated occurrence, officials fail to protect low-lying areasWith just 4 cm of rainfall lashing Bengaluru, flash floods have appeared in multiple parts of the city. Despite its multiple occurrences throughout the year, the city seems to be unable to find the plug.Last year, in November, the city witnessed heavy rainfall with some parts flooding due to the overflowing of lakes. Consequently, Chief Ministerhad instructed the BBMP to prepare a detailed project report for stormwater drain widening and building diversion channels. In addition, he had also announced a special package of Rs 900 crore for the project.Despite the repeated occurrence, officials are failing to protect the low-lying areas in the city. Low lying areas like Fayazabad under the Yelachenahalli ward are subjected to flash floods at least 2-3 times a year. The 70-80 houses in the vicinity get submerged in water and water enters the houses, causing lots of damage to property. On April 14, the city experienced unexpected rainfall lasting just around 1 hour, but flash floods seem to have appeared at various locations.are complaining of water entering their houses to cars getting washed away.Heavy rain pounded the city withreceiving (about 73 mm), and around 80 houses near Kamakya theatre were flooded. A family was shocked to see the car in which they were travelling was washed away.Due to the heavy rain (about 73 mm) in and around the Vidyapeeth Kamakya theatre in the South Zone, water from the stormwater drain has flooded the low-lying areas. As the rainwater from the stormwater drain moved backwardly, 20 households in the Ganesh Mandir ward have been flooded with three feet of water and household appliances have been damaged by the floodwaters. Around 30 houses in Chikkasandra Ward have been flooded with water. Paurakarmikas and BBMP personnel are clearing the waterlogged houses and accumulated on roads, using shilt and tractors.Bommanahalli Zone’ssaid: “About 150 houses in Uttarahalli area have been flooded. Meals and water have been provided to the residents. The surveys, in connection with the waterlogged houses, are being taken up by the officials from the revenue and the engineering section.”A resident of Fayazabad told BM: “Being a low-lying area, there is a huge catchment of stormwater flow from JP Nagar,and Kanakapura main road. There are sharp 90-degree turnings in the SWD leading to an overflow. BWSSB is also diverting sewage to SWDS. We have been pushing for a new drain for the past 20 years. Whenever there is rain, water enters the houses and residents incur heavy losses every time.”Reportedly, after media reports surfaced about Fayazabad, BBMP officials visited the spot and promised the residents to build a diversion channel under the Nagarothana scheme.Experts feel that the root cause of flash floods in the city can be ascertained as rajakaluve encroachments.Veteran lake activist and founder of Friends of Lakes,, said: “We should ensure that we capture the rainwater by building more recharge wells and maintenance of lakes to effectively function as flood mitigation systems.

In perennial struggle with its inglorious traffic mess, its mountains of daily muck, and soaring water demand, Bengaluru city is always on the lookout for successful urban management models to emulate. The Electronic City Township Authority (ELCITA), with its multiple smart systems might be tough to scale up, but it does offer strategies to tackle many of the big city woes.

Is it rocket science, for instance, to adopt a data-driven approach to solve one of Bengaluru’s most visible trouble-spots, its roads? Pothole counting is a routine BBMP exercise, but a taxing one at that. So, why not automate the process like how ELCITA did with a few mobile cameras fitted to a car that drives around once a fortnight or month?

Here’s how pothole management works in Electronics City

The camera captures road visuals from multiple angles, which are then uploaded to a software driven by artificial intelligence (AI).

The system matches these visuals with images of the same road taken before. Any crack, pothole or depression on the road surface is instantly spotted and its precise location geotagged.

An assessment team from the Authority goes to the spot, rectifies the fault, and uploads a fresh image. The system automatically updates the task as rectified, ensuring real-time monitoring, transparency and accountability. Equipped with men, machines and money, can the Palike adopt this strategy, at least as a pilot?

Still evolving, the AI-based system is now being trained to differentiate between a wet patch and a pothole. This could further boost its efficiency during monsoon, when the interplay of asphalt and stagnant water can get tricky.

The message is clear: Despite ELCITA’s jurisdictional area of a mere 903 acres, learnings from its methods can help the city get its basics right: Zero potholes, storm-water drains cleared and unclogged much before the rains.

Preparing for changes expected by arrival of Namma Metro

In ELCITA’s proposed Metro Neo project lurks a potential solution to link the city’s last miles. Much before the Namma Metro line finds its way into Electronics City, the Authority has realised that a lot of people will switch from their two-wheelers and four-wheelers to the convenient mass transport option.

The objective is simple: A seamless commute from the two planned metro stations to the companies.

Glaring inter-modal connectivity gaps have plagued the Namma Metro project, and this remain unaddressed years after the first train chugged in. Contrast this with the Neo project, a 5-km network featuring a trolleybus system with overhead electric traction, stopping initially at 10 stations. Once the Detailed Project Report (DPR) is ready, the project could be commissioned by June 2024, according to ELCITA Chief Executive Officer Lt. Col. Ravindra Singh.

To bypass constraints of Electronics City’s narrow roads, the system will run on elevated lines. Proposed are electric bus coaches fitted with rubber tyres, drawing power from overhead wires. The capacity of each coach could be in the range of 250 passengers. But even beyond the Metro Neo, the last-mile focus will extend to bus stops with the deployment of electric scooters and smaller shuttles.

Why no complaints of flooding in Electronics City

The recent floods that had residents around the city’s Outer Ring Road (ORR) in a twister of commute and livelihood woes were attributed to poor drain management. Besides glaring encroachment of the critical linking canals, drains — shoulder, primary and secondary — that remained uncleared pre-monsoon proved to be a huge factor.

Here too, ELCITA had a best practice in place: Extensive repairs were carried out in drains where required. Potential flooding spots identified by analysed data were under constant surveillance. User complaints were addressed in quick time, ensuring that there were no major problems.

In contrast, a flood-warning app developed for Bengaluru by the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) largely remains unused for coordination and preparation.

Emulating ELCITA will not be easy for BBMP

Coordination is critical for any urban management system to work smartly, and the Authority’s synchronised networking experience could be a precedent for the Bengaluru Metropolitan Land Transport Authority (BMLTA), now in its nascent draft bill avatar.

For instance, Electronics City has a robust security system in place integrating the security systems of individual companies, ELCITA’s own staff, the city police and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF).

Beyond the best practices of ELCITA that the city’s administration could try and emulate in pockets as a pilot, lies a need to strike a balance. Explains V. Ravichandar, an urbanist: “ELCITA’s biggest takeaway is that it is possible to manage a self-contained township with village characteristics, provided the people running it have the monetary wherewithal and the requisite professionalism to manage the multiple challenges.”

But the most important aspect, he notes, is the sensitivity and inclusivity required. “This is not just for the elite, but should actually help the lives of the underprivileged and the villagers. The ability to carry the community along and give them a voice in the whole arrangement is key, besides giving them a share of the taxes collected. It is on the last count that I have my reservations on scalability.”

The Authority, as its CEO informs, provides 30% of its revenue to the panchayats as compensation since it was carved out of the villages.

Scaling up ELCITA’s experience to the BBMP level may seem an insurmountable challenge. But even applying the same dynamics to other industrial areas within the city could prove daunting, as Ravichandar notes. He refers to Peenya’s long fight for a similar setup. “It never happened. Part of the reason, I suspect, was the integrated outlook — that it is more than the people in the industrial township. That spirit was very important, which I think ELCITA had, but Peenya did not.”",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The Bengaluru East tahsildar has issued notice to 13 residents of the luxury Rainbow Drive gated community in the city, which was flooded after heavy rain recently, for alleged encroachment of a storm-water drain.

The authorities alleged that the residents’ properties block major areas of the culvert, making the layout prone to flooding during the rain. “We have sent notice to 13 residents who have encroached the storm-water drain in the layout. We have conducted a survey to identify the encroachments and found 35 illegal encroachments near Junnasandra and Halanayakanahalli lake, which are near the Rainbow Drive layout,” tahsildar Ajith Kumar told The Hindu.

“This initial notice which we have sent is to the properties in Junnasandra survey numbers. On Tuesday, we are conducting a meeting with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) regarding the eviction drive and we will only evict the area where it is feasible for the water flow,” he added.

According to the Bengaluru district administration, Halanayakanahalli lake is the connecting lake for Junnasandra lake and Saul Kere. The layout is located near Halanayakanahalli lake. Whenever Junnasandra lake overflows, the water does not reach Halanayakanahalli lake due to the encroachments of its channel and that leads to the flooding, said officials.

Since August, the layout has flooded four times. In August first week, residents of Rainbow Drive layout took to the streets in protest against the civic authorities’ apathy. According to residents, the gated community was constructed about 25 years ago and has nearly 300 houses.

Whenever the layout is flooded with more than three feet of water, the residents are forced to use tractors and boats from their houses to the main gate to negotiate the stagnant rainwater. Days after the rain stopped in the city, tractors, boats, and rafts were being used by the layout residents while the Fire Department staff were draining water out continuously.

The layout is one of the posh localities on Sarjapur road which is spread over 36 acres, with about 400 plots varying from 1,500 sq. feet to 3,000 sq. feet in size.",issue,Rainbow Drive Flood,"Bengaluru, India",August 2022,September 2022,Rainbow Drive gated community,100 mm,300 houses flooded,0,Residents forced to use tractors and boats to navigate the flooded streets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

An inundated Outer Ring Road (ORR) and Bengaluru-Mysuru expressway will perhaps be one of the defining images of 2022 as the city drowned in record rains along with civic and political apathy.

Downpour in the last week of August and first week of September brought Bengaluru, especially the IT corridor and the adjoining areas from east Bengaluru along the ORR to south-east Bengaluru, to a standstill. Various parts of the city were flooded and nothing was spared — tech parks, posh layouts, offices, major roads and houses.

The city not just made headlines on rain related damage, but also broke a 75-year old record. On September 4, according to the India Meteorological Department, the city received 131.6 mm of rainfall. This, according to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), was the third heaviest spell in the city for a 24-hour period in September in the past 75 years.

Lakes breached

Bengaluru, home to hundreds of lakes — both alive and dead — also saw many lakes, including the Bellandur lake, breach, affecting areas around while also exposing the illegal encroachments of lakes in the city, resulting in a series of anti-encroachment drives of Storm Water Drains (SWDs).

The BBMP said a total of 162 lakes were filled to the brim, of which 126 breached this year after rain. Various experts and even residents’ welfare groups alleged that the sudden flooding was a result of the civic body’s mismanagement which led to the encroachment of lakes and the SWDs. Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai also blamed illegal encroachments in the south-east zone as the reason for flooding.

A study showed that in 1800, the city’s water bodies had a cumulative capacity to hold 35 tmcft of water. The average rainfall the city receives today is estimated to be around 15 tmcft of water and this year, it was only marginally higher. However, if most of the city’s lakes are overflowing and there are floods, it only means their holding capacity has dwindled severely.

SWD neglected

To clear the encroachments of SWDs, the Chief Minister allocated ₹300 crore and also allocated ₹1500 crore for clearing out the stagnant water.

For decades, the BBMP has been in the process of remodelling the SWD network. According to BBMP data, nearly 428 km of the city’s 842-km network of SWDs has been remodelled.

BBMP’s mismanagement

The areas which were flooded this year were mostly villages included to the city limits in 2007, which were at that time governed by gram panchayats and town municipalities and could not catch up with the development boom of the IT industry and continued to be mismanaged under BBMP limits.

The IT boom saw tech parks and office spaces come up in the south east zone, which made real estate companies start building residential projects and shopping malls to cater to those working here. But, the authorities concerned failed to plan the development in this region and didn’t come up with any regulation and lakes and SWD were eventually misused by a nexus of realtors and politicians, experts point out.

The city’s water supply was also stopped for a day after heavy rains in Mandya district flooded the pumping stations of Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), which supplies Cauvery water to Bengaluru.

Anti-encroachment drive

Days after rain reduced in the city, the BBMP started to act against the illegal encroachments of SWD and lake by using bulldozers. For a few days, the drive did happen, but stopped reportedly on the pretext of resurvey and stay orders brought by the building owners.

BBMP identified encroachments in top tech parks, apartments, posh residential gated layouts and educational institutions. The civic body conducted a drive against these properties and gradually stopped the drive.

According to BBMP data submitted by Mahadevapura zone — one of the most densely developed areas over the last two decades and the worst hit by floods this year — it had 1,689 encroachments of SWDs in 2016-17, the highest for any zone by a large margin when the clearance drive began. Now, the Mahadevapura zone has only 133 encroachments left, and the rest have been cleared over the years, according to BBMP.

The BBMP in October said that they have identified 504 encroachments, excluding around 67 instances of encroachments in which the alleged encroachers have approached various courts.

Single-day losses

IT firms and banking establishments in the ORR area claimed to have incurred a loss of ₹225 crore owing to the heavy rains and flooding on August 30, said Outer Ring Road Companies’ Association (ORRCA) in a letter to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai.

This has prompted users to say that cities like Noida are booming and whether Bengaluru deserves its India’s Silicon Valley title or not.

Head of Government Relations at Appinventiv Ayush Gupta shared a screenshot of Noida. Gupta wrote, “I won’t be surprised if most of the IT companies based in Bangalore soon move their base to Noida.” He said that Bengaluru is flooded, companies are facing major losses due to the failing infrastructure system, and traffic is a huge concern. ""Basically, Bengaluru just has nice weather,"" he said.

He said, Noida, on the other hand is booming and is a perfectly managed city whether it is during traffic hours, rain or infrastructure. Gupta credited the Yogi government for transforming the city in the last five years.

Another debate was sparked after a user said that Gurugram is better than Bengaluru for startups, as the airport is literally 20 minutes away, cabs are more easily available, and metro connectivity is much better compared to Bengaluru. “You can add to the list in the comments or tell me why Bangalore is better. Either way, I’m not moving.”

A user also wondered whether Bengaluru versus other cities is the new debate in the market now whereas another person wondered whether boating services are live in Bengaluru or not. CoinSwitch Kuber’s Ankit Vengurlekar talked about ensuring employees’ wellbeing over anything else in situations like these.

He wrote, “While Bangalore was flooded and millions were adversely affected, some fold sat on footover bridges and ensured continuity of work. WHY are we so obsessed with working?” He further questioned managers and companies on the steps they are taking to ensure the well-being of their employees in such dire straits.

Meanwhile, floods in Bengaluru have led to a loss of Rs 225 crore on a single day to both IT and banking companies. The Outer Ring Road Companies Association (ORRCA) wrote to Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai and said IT and banking sectors along the Outer Ring Road corridor employ over half a million professionals and generate revenue worth $22 million annually.

The letter stated, “Poor infrastructure on this corridor however is bringing down the efficiency and productivity of the companies and putting employee safety and well-being at risk. Flooding on ORR on August 20 has led to a loss of Rs 225 crore as staff were stuck on the road for more than 5 hours.”

In a bid to keep the states’ economy and their operations going, employees of Wipro, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Flipkart and Swiggy were forced to work from home. Those who were not so lucky had to opt for unusual modes of transportation like tractor rides to reach office.

This has resulted in huge volumes of traffic as the alternate roads are unprepared to accommodate the entire diverted vehicles,” a resident said.Unscientific methods of road management have resulted in water drains overflowing, and flooding adjacent localities.“Earlier, the 17th Cross Road was dug up for water works for about two months and then let open for use after patching up. Following which the roads were asphalted as two cars got caved in the open road.

Following the suggestion of Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, we have decided to install sluice gates. They will help prevent flooding –Tushar Giri Nath, BBMP Chief Commissioner

BWSSB

With many areas in the city being prone to flash floods, the(BBMP) has decided to install sluice gates for lakes and diversion channels.BBMP Chief Commissionersaid, “Following the suggestion of Chief Minister, we have decided to install sluice gates. These gates at lakes will help prevent flooding. At diversion channels, it can withhold waste water from flowing into lakes and open when there is excessive rainfall.”According to BBMP officials, sluice gates will help with emptying lakes ahead of monsoon so that they have enough water holding capacity when it rains. Besides this, the lakes need to be desilted before monsoon to increase their storage capacity. This provision is currently unavailable in any lakes that have waste weirs but are much above the lake bed.Experts suggest that these sluice gates need to be constructed at the level of the lake bed to enable emptying of the entire lake if warranted.They also say that the BBMP should immediately take up installation of sluice gates as it will help with regulated and measured release of water from the lakes.The agency has begun the removal of encroachments in the city. Nath said, “There are two kinds of encroachments; one on storm water drains or rajakaluve, and the second one in the buffer zone. Many of the areas like, RR Nagar,, Yelahanka, KR Puram, and Yelahanka were under the respective City Municipal or Town Municipal Councils where permission was granted to construct houses on rajakaluves or storm water drains. If there are encroachments on the rajakaluve or storm water drain, then we can immediately remove it.”However, if there are encroachments on the buffer zone that date back to 2008, the BBMP would need to see if they can remove those as there can be a few legal issues.Experts say that the BBMP needs to think about alternatives as the rajakaluves have been designed to ensure flow of water where rainfall is up to 50 mm. However, of late, many areas are receiving rainfall beyond 50 mm and it needs to be scientifically studied if the rajakaluves have the capacity to carry excess water.Meanwhile, there is also a proposal to make lake water potable. Nath said that thewas working on an ambitious proposal to make lake waters potable.“To make lake water potable, the entire city needs to be covered in a sewage network and ensure that zero sewage is flowing to lakes. However, the process is still going on as there is a requirement of more sewage treatment plants,” he added.",solution,2022 Bengaluru floods,"Bengaluru, Karnataka","May 17, 2022","May 19, 2022","['Dasarahalli', 'Mahadevapura', 'Bommanahalli']","['100 mm, 150 mm, 200 mm']","['$10 million', '$20 million', '$30 million']","['1, 2, 3']","['Thousands of people were displaced from their homes.', 'Many roads and bridges were damaged.', ""The city's infrastructure was severely damaged.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,"['Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike', 'Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai', 'BWSSB']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The weatherman has predicted more rains in the city as authorities and rescue personnel worked towards restoring normalcy on Tuesday (September 6).

The woman, working in a private school, was returning home on her scooty on Monday night when she fell into a waterlogged road in Siddapura and got electrocuted and died, police said.

Unprecedented rains have caused massive havoc in two parts of Bengaluru, especially Mahadevapura, Karnataka Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai said, adding that officers, engineers, workers and SDRF [State Disaster Relief Force] team are working 24×7.

Bommai said the problem was three-fold. First, Mahadevapura area has 69 tanks in a small area and all are overflowing, and second, establishments are in lower level. The third problem is encroachments.

“We have taken it as a challenge. We have cleared a lot of encroachments and we are going to continue to clear them. Secondly, we are putting sluice gates to the tanks so, that we can manage them better,” he said.

He also said that drinking water supply in affected areas of Bengaluru will be restored by afternoon. Of the two affected pumping stations in Mandya district, water has receded from one and the other one is being cleared so that pumping can resume today afternoon.

Bommai blamed the ‘unplanned misrule’ of the previous Congress government for the situation where several residential localities in Bengaluru had to face flood-like situations.

He said the previous government recklessly gave permission to build houses and apartments in tanks, tank bunds and in buffer zones, and never thought about the management of tanks. He said his government has released ₹1,500 crore towards the construction of the much-needed rajakaluve.

“On Monday, encroachments worth ₹300 crore had been removed. Instructions are given that the construction quality of rajakaluve must be good. A system will be made to ensure that there would be no problems with the free flow of water. At the same time, encroachment will not be allowed,” CM Bommai said.

The Indian Meteorological department has predicted widespread light to moderate rains over Karnataka, with thunderstorms with lightning and very heavy rains likely at isolated places, including Bengaluru and outskirts.

BHPian grkonweb recently shared this with other enthusiasts.

An Abrupt End to my Hexa Ownership

Earlier this month, with a heavy heart I gave up my beloved Tata Hexa to salvage buyer as the beast got flood damaged and was assessed as total loss by insurance company on the basis of repairs estimate provided by authorized service center.

Back in Nov 2021 we are on a trip to a village near Nagercoil, Kanyakumari for an Ayurvedic treatment, it was raining heavily. Due to flash floods triggered by opening of dam gates upstream overnight, Hexa was submerged in water till tyre level for 3 days. I couldn't move the vehicle to a safer place as it happened overnight and in the morning I was stunned to see the below scene.

We waited for 3 days for the water to recede and thereafter I got it towed to local Tata Authorized Service Station (TASS) at Nagercoil and the repair estimate (mostly connected car spares & electricals like ECU, main wiring kit, etc) exceeded 75% of IDV and hence they pushed for total loss. Since being a true blue beast lover I was not mentally prepared to accept the decision and got the vehicle shipped (in flat bed truck) to Bangalore TASS at my own expense in December for second opinion. I wanted to try my best to save the vehicle and spent Rs 96k from my pocket for this effort.

The local surveyor at Bangalore advised the TASS to first check the engine and automatic transmission are in good condition before proceeding with any repairs. This time it was found the auto tranny got water ingress and the transmission electronic component in question was major replacement cost-wise. The new repair estimate at Bangalore exceeded the IDV! More than the repair cost, what convinced me to give up the car was given the water damage to the auto transmission unit and it would not be reliable especially for my long drives with family. Many of my friends who had experienced water damage in Chennai floods, advised me to give up as they said the car electronics (and reliability) will never be the same even after expensive repairs.

I've owned many cars in the past and I was never emotionally invested in any of them. To me, car is a word but Hexa is an emotion. It was gut wrenching decision to finally agree for total loss and it took all this while to mentally prepare myself (first time when I heard total loss advise from insurance company in Dec, I got angry - so much emotionally attachment to Hexa) and the family too are fond of the beast. Finally, the insurance formalities got completed earlier this month.

This is how my beloved Hexa looked ready to be towed by the salvage buyer...too good to let go!

Few lessons I learnt from this episode which I'm sharing for everyone's benefit:

1. Please do not cut premium costs by reducing IDV (mine was just Rs 7.73 lacs & my repair estimate came up to Rs 7.85 lacs, of course, some components could have been checked & used instead of replacement) especially if your vehicle is 5+ years old. I didn't apply my mind when the insurance came up for renewal last year, I didn't bother much about the reduced IDV and that did me in.

2. If you are in flood prone area, take engine protect cover as well in the insurance. Also opt for return to invoice feature if eligible.

3. Take insurance from TASS as I heard (not sure though) they have big clout with insurance companies to push insurance claim favorable to owners.

4. Take RSA from TASS (I heard, not sure though) which has a feature where there is no limit on distance covered for peace of mind if your vehicle is 5+ years. Of course, extended warranty coverage goes without saying.

5. In case water level is raising and you are unable to move the vehicle to safer place (in my case the road level was lower than the place we were staying and moving out will only make it worse), the best option is to:

(i) disconnect the battery to avoid fouling up with electronics.

(ii) wrap the exhaust pipes with polythene sheets to avoid water ingress

I'm yet to fully come to terms with the abrupt loss (just 40k in odomoter, Sep 2017 XTA model with no prior accident history, maintained passionately) and the vehicle body in pristine condition and engine parts intact. Had it met with accident and body went out of shape it's a different matter. In hindsight, to come to think of it, at least we didn't meet with any accident that would have harmed us physically but Hexa went away intact except for electronic & electrical components.

Tata Hexa was an aspirational vehicle for me and Hexa was all the more special for me personally as I came from buying the cheapest (not in a bad way) car Tata Indica Xeta GLG way back in Sep 2007 and God was kind to me that I could pick up the flagship model in Tata lineup - Tata Hexa XTA (my first automatic, https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/offic...ml#post4262444 (Tata Hexa : Official Review)) in Sep 2017 - in just 10 years. We enjoyed the car, the long drives, admiring looks from people, great memories and the camaraderie of extended Hexa family - Hexatrons Bangalore Group (HBG) and Tata SOUL (SUV Owners United League) group.

Thanks to the brotherhood of HBG and I personally got to know many Hexa owners. Will be missing the breakfast drives and the great conversations & company. The passion for a car, helpful nature of members, bonding over Hexa are all something I experienced first hand thanks to Hexa and I'll remember for long.

Yet I've to move on and I started looking (upon family's insistence) for similar 7 seater full sized SUV and none of the existing models in today's market comes close to Hexa’s ride handling, quality and comfort & at my budget (less than Rs 30 lacs which itself is a big stretch for me). Someway or other the current available line up of 7 seaters seem to be a compromise and they are no match for Hexa in terms of ride quality & tank-like safety IMHO.

What Next?

I did extensive survey of the 7-seater market (family wants next vehicle equivalent to Hexa if not better) and none of the cars match the value, comfort, safety & road presence of Hexa today IMHO. In my survey, I found SUVs either obscenely priced or don't look the part (subjective) or lack certain utility aspects.

Here's a quick review of the SUVs/MUVs I looked at:

Mahindra XUV 700: Nice package with Auto + AWD combo, loaded with tech features to the gills (not sure how they will hold up in the mid to long run plus my experience of how too many electronics if water damaged, will go down the drain). Polarizing looks IMHO (it is subjective) - I don't know how it will age over the next few years, I'm afraid the vehicle might look odd down the years. It costs almost 29 lacs top end AT +AWD at Bangalore on the road price. The biggest downer for me was the insane waiting period of 75 weeks thanks to the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage. Ruled out this beautiful car as I believe I don't have to do tapas to get a vehicle. Reminds me of my Dad's purchase of Bajaj scooter way back in mid-80s thanks to then government policies, production was controlled and waiting period for a Bajaj Chetak was 7 years. He had to settle for a Bajaj Super bought from a broker (technically my Dad was 2nd owner) by paying Rs 7k premium over the price. In this aspect, the more times changes, things remain the same!

MG Hector Plus: Did not want to buy Chinese owned though it is a British brand. Plus the vehicle looked oddly proportioned in certain angles (subjective, no offense to owners). The huge vertical-oriented tablet was a turn off for me as I learn even AC controls are in-built in the unit with no hardware knobs. I believe a driver should not be distracted by such gizmos and his/her focus 100% should be on the road for safety.

Toyota Innova Crysta: Reliable, Resale value, great service center experience, Toyota brand, long engine life (as they say, Toyota outlives its owners!), proven mile muncher were all plus points. But the biggest negative for me was the non-availability of bench seat in 2nd row in the top end ZX AT version. With a kid it is a must for a 2nd row bench seat as it is convenient for her to sleep during long drives. Checked with dealers if seat swap could be done at the dealer level - nope was the answer. At 32 plus lacs on road price at Bangalore, it is an expensive buy which I'm reluctantly OK but the lack of bench seat was a turn off. I'm fine with the lack of creature comforts like panoramic sunroof, connected car features, MPV looks and taxi image but still when it doesn't fulfill my functional requirement, it didn't make the cut.

Ruled out:

1. Kia Carnival - luxurious though, but super expensive for me plus didn't want to drive a van (no offense to owners) and huge size.

2. Hyundai Alcazar - it is a notch down in the pecking order with 1500 cc engine. After using 2000 cc engines for the last 13+ years, I didn't want to downgrade to a lower cc engine.

3. Kia Carens - Same reason as above, both Alcazar and Carens are nice cars which will be appreciated by 1st time owners who upgrade from hatchbacks but when you are used to Hexa-level luxury, they don't make the cut.

4. Mahindra Scorpio (2022 yet to be launched) - This old workhorse was my ride many years ago and I wonder how I put up with the bouncy ride in those days. Heard it is slated for launch in mid-2022 and it is being slotted a notch down Mahindra XUV 700. Not for me!

5. Jeep Meridian - Had a silly wish that this vehicle when launched could be in Rs 30 - 35 lacs price OTR. But nope, heard that it is being slotted in Rs 40 - 45 lacs price range OTR and this is way beyond my budget.

No pre-owned vehicle is preferred by myself & family, so there goes the option of pre-worshipped Hexa.

What I found in my hunt for Hexa replacement was, at Rs 25-29 lac range OTR in Bangalore, very few capable 7 seater SUVs are available suiting my needs. Either a notch below (<20 lacs OTR) or above (>30 lacs OTR) you have options but again they are few. IMO, proper 7 seaters SUVs are available only from Tata & Mahindra stable in Rs 25 to 29 lacs OTR price range.

Finally, after reading the entire threat in this forum, ownership reviews, many Youtube review videos and multiple test drives I booked Tata Safari XZA+ Dark Edition (again a Tata - rather going to be 5th Tata vehicle in our family's ownership history), proves once a Tata customer always a Tata customer! Hoping to take delivery before end of March 2022. Safari is not a perfect replacement for Hexa, for sure there are few features that were not available in Hexa but still I feel Safari is a compromise and not in the league of Hexa. Only Hexa owners will get this. And I know dark colors are a pain to maintain - scratches & dust are visible easily and any dark color is a safety hazard while driving at night especially in highways. I went for dark edition purely for the black seats & interiors (family didn't like Adventure Persona edition Tropical Mist color) as white is super difficult to maintain. I did notice the test drive car front seats were soiled.

IT firms and banking establishments in the Outer Ring Road (ORR) area have incurred a loss of ₹225 crore owing to the heavy rains and flooding on August 30, said Outer Ring Road Companies’ Association (ORRCA) in a letter to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai.

Seeking Mr. Bommai’s attention to address the “appalling infrastructure” in the ORR region in particular and the city in general, ORRCA said half a million professionals were employed along the ORR region between Central Silk Board and Krishnaraja Puram corridor.

“Heavy rains and flooding in the Outer Ring Road area on August 30, which brought parts of Bengaluru to its knees, led to a loss of about ₹ 225 crore in a single day,‘‘ the association said.

Revenue generation

IT firms on the ORR generate revenue of $22 billion every year, accounting for 32% of Bengaluru’s total IT revenue. The area was also the highest tax contributor to the exchequer, the association wrote.

“Poor infrastructure on this corridor, however, is bringing down the efficiency and productivity of companies located here and putting employee safety and well-being at risk. Flooding on ORR on August 30 has led to a loss of ₹225 crore as professionals were stuck on the road for more than five hours,’‘ ORRCA said in its letter.

Sharing its concern, the association further wrote that the inadequate infrastructure on ORR has now reached a “crisis level.” Even though only 30% of ORR population has returned to office, the collapse of the infrastructure has drawn global concern about Bengaluru’s ability to handle further growth.

Arterial roads

ORRCA has appealed to the government to expedite improvement projects on key arterial roads to ORR such as Old Airport Road, ITPL Road, and Varthur Road, as they are regularly used by their staff and the public.

The office-bearers also demanded that the detailed ORR BMRCL 2A metro rail project timelines be shared and strictly adhered to. There were several examples of planned road infrastructure and initiatives being stalled which has only aggravated the issues on ORR, it wrote.

Further cautioning the State administration, the association said it was in the collective interest of ORRCA.

The impact of the rains onhas become a subject for intense debate on social media. The latest report from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike () has shown that 136 apartment complexes were affected inzone alone (excluding independent houses). If urgent measures are not taken then, these complexes will be prone to more flooding in the years to come, sources told Bangalore Mirror.The report says that around 27 roads in the Mahadevapura zone were flooded during the recent downpour. Out of them, 17 were in particularly bad shape, affecting traffic. Many cars parked on the roadsides were also flooded and people were struck while trying to wade through the water.The flooding of apartments was mainly seen at, Doddenakundi,, Hoodi, Kadugodi, Marathahalli, Munnekolala, Varthur, Whitefield, Kannamangala, andUntil Friday, water from 130 apartments was flushed out while the process was still on in six apartments, claimed BBMP officials. Apart from apartment complexes, 600 independent houses were also inundated. After pumping out of water, residents are requesting the BBMP to remove the silt, which is a big challenge.is being requested to offer water sucking machines to remove rain-mixed sewage water from underground sumps.The Bommanahalli zone also saw severe rain-related problems. Around nine roads in HSR Layout’s sixth and seventh sectors were flooded. According to estimates, 140 houses in Bommanahalli were affected. BBMP officials say that the major damage was witnessed in those houses which were next to the rajakaluve in Hongasandra and Begur, Madiwala Lake, Arakere, Hulimavu, Puttenahalli, Chikkaswamy, Ashtalakshmi, and. Many lakes overflowed and flooded the areas downstream, an analysis by the BBMP found. Mahadevapura zone, which bore the maximum brunt of the rains, saw 42 lakes being filled up, followed by 30 in Bommanahalli, 22 in RR Nagar, 19 in Yelahanka, six in Dasarahalli, four in the south zone, two in the east, and one in the west.BBMP officials say that the only way forward is to clear encroachments in rajakaluves. In the last few days, 34 encroachments (14 in Mahadevapura, nine in Yelahanka, four in Bommanahalli, three in RR Nagar, two in Dasarahalli, and one each in east and west zones) have been removed, and 21,963.82 square feet of land has been freed from encroachments.Many residents in Mahadevapura zone are complaining of an increase in mosquitoes after rainfall. With no proper electricity, residents are having a tough time. A BBMP official said, “ASHA workers are being sent to the rain affected apartments for creating awareness on vector borne diseases like dengue and chikungunya.

About 1,000 people have been killed since 2018 in monsoon related incidents. The highest number of deaths this year were reported in Tumakuru district (10), followed by Uttara Kannada (10), Dakshina Kannada (7) and Raichur (7).Two people have died in Bengaluru city. Also, 1,161 animals, including livestock, died between June 1 and September 7, the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) revealed These deaths were caused by floods, lightning strikes, landslides, falling of trees and collapse of structures among others, said Manoj Rajan , commissioner SDMA. Besides, three people are missing and 36 sustained injuries.This year — the fifth consecutive year of heavier than usual rains — the monsoon hit earlier than usual. On the bright side, all water bodies are full, although breaches and damages to around 600 irrigation tanks, especially in south interior Karnataka including Bengaluru, have caused widespread damage. Rajan said, overall, the state saw 106% excess rain during the premonsoon season.This was coupled by several days — from three to as much as a week — of high-intensity incessant rainfall in June, July, and August. Experts say climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of the monsoon and this has caused much of the damage. “Rain, floods, and water are not new to people in Karnataka, but this time the death toll is quite high.This is largely because of flash floods and building collapses,” saidDeepak NB , a climate change expert. “Heavy rain across the state led to over-saturation of soil, triggering structure collapse especially houses and walls.” Flooding and landslides have become common in the monsoon since 2019, and poorly constructed buildings, mainly old houses, buckle after days of non-stop rain.Revenue department officials say 35,605 houses have been damaged, 13,644 of which have been completely or severely damaged. Unlike in previous years, officials say districts like Tumakuru, Kolar, Chikkaballapur, Chitradurga, and Kolar, which usually record deficit rainfall, have this time recorded a surplus.",,2021 Karnataka floods,"Karnataka, India","June 1, 2021","September 7, 2021","['Tumakuru district', 'Uttara Kannada', 'Dakshina Kannada', 'Raichur', 'Bengaluru city']",106% excess rain during the premonsoon season,"35,605 houses have been damaged, 13,644 of which have been completely or severely damaged",119,widespread damage,Climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of the monsoon and this has caused much of the damage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Flooding on the National Highway leading to Kemepegowda International Airport (KIA) in Bengaluru resulted in many air passengers missing their flights. A low-lying section of the national highway near the Indian Air Force base at Yelahanka was inundated following heavy overnight rain. Travellers heading to the airport got stuck on the highway (Ballari Road) and could not reach the KIA on time to board their flights.

Traffic police said that the water level was at least four feet high, making it impossible for taxis and cars to navigate the stretch. At night, a bus broke down while crossing the stretch, resulting in the road getting blocked. The pile-up of traffic stretched for over a kilometre.

Saurav Sharma, who was stuck in the traffic for close to an hour, said, “I went to drop my family members at the airport. I was stuck for close to an hour. The traffic was not moving at all. This is pathetic. Road users are getting a raw deal despite paying a hefty toll fee. It is very shameful on the part of the NHAI that they are unable to fix the water-logging problem and causing inconvenience to the public.”

Every day, thousands of passengers use the highway to reach the airport.

Chandrashekar, another passenger said, “The traffic pile-up stretched from the flyover opposite BSF headquarters to the IAF base. It was really frustrating. Some taxi drivers took a left turn near BSF headquarters and used the service road to reach the other end of the road. They drive in the opposite direction (to the traffic) as their customers were getting late.”

Some passengers got down from the taxi and boarded Vayu Vajra services of the BMTC to reach the airport as smaller vehicles could not cross the flooded area.

People vented their ire on social media.

Biswajeet Rana said he missed his flight due to the flooding. He said a passenger travelling by train from Majestic to Chennai would reach his destination faster than a person heading to Bengaluru airport from home.

A police personnel manning traffic near the flooded area said, “I have not moved from here since May 17 night. Flooding is common here during rains, but the NHAI has not done anything to fix the problem. A bus broke down while crossing the flooded area. There is no service road near the IAF base, and all the vehicles have to take the main lane. This has resulted in a pile-up of vehicles.”

It was not just flyers who were at the receiving end. Students going to colleges also missed their classes due to the traffic jam.

BIAL, who operate KIA, released an advisory stating that passengers heading to the airport might face slow-moving traffic due to water-logging and should plan their travel accordingly.

The unplanned and slow-paced construction of a new stormwater drain (SWD) has leftresidents in a fix. A few months ago, the entire area was affected by heavy floods for days along with other major regions of the city. Following that, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP)decided to construct a newdrain in the area.However, locals say that the construction is unnecessary and authorities should instead focus on desilting existing SWDs and rajakaluves in the area that were encroached upon as they were the major reason behind the recent floods in the Mahadevapura zone.For the SWD construction, a majority of the 2nd Main Road in Belathur has been dug up. Residents in the area say that they are not able to take any vehicles out for almost two months because of this., a resident of 3rd Main Road, Belathur, said “The work is going on at a really slow pace. In the 30 feet road, hardly three or four feet of space has been left for us to walk. If the priority was given to desilting, the issue could have been easily resolved.”Many major apartments like Prime Mansion, Vivek Sansakar, andare situated in the area with over 500 flats. All the residents have been facing a hard time because of the unplanned construction. They said that they have urged the SWD Department several times over the past month to speed up, but no action was taken. Belathur canal, which is the remnant ofriver, flows near the area. Residents say it is one of the major reasons behind the recent floods., also a resident, said, “Until and unless they resolve the main issue, how can they start another construction? First, resolve the main issue - the encroachment of Dakshina Pinakini river, and then if there is a need, start the construction. Authorities do not want to take the blame for encroachment, so they are putting the residents through trouble.”The residents also said that authorities should discuss things with them before starting a major construction job.“There is no space to walk, let alone any car or two-wheeler. People are facing a lot of problems because of this. School buses are unable to enter the area. Children have to cross through a narrow patch along the main road. If there is any emergency in the apartment, there is no way for an ambulance to access this patch,” said another resident.Because of the digging, power cuts have also become frequent.“There are power cuts and internet cables have been affected. Since a lot of people work from home, it has become a huge problem. Due to the digging, the 11 kV line was also affected, and as a result, there are no streetlights in the area and along the alternate route. We cannot go out after dark,” said Navneet Pai, a resident of Vivek Sansakar apartments.A BBMP official said that construction has not been halted and they are unsure about when the work will be complete.",issue,Belathur Flood,"Belathur, Bengaluru",2022-06-01,2022-06-05,"['Belathur', 'Highlife Nature']",100 mm,Major damage to infrastructure,0,Thousands of people were displaced from their homes,"{'cause': 'Unplanned construction of a new stormwater drain', 'responsible_department': 'SWD department', 'response': 'BBMP officials said that construction has not been halted and they are unsure about when the work will be complete'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Accusing the ruling BJP in Karnataka of trying to 'shift blame' on the Congress for the recent rain related miseries in Bengaluru to hide its failures, Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah on Thursday urged the government to come out with a white paper on clearing encroachment on storm water drains in the city.

The former Chief Minister said, the ""brand Bengaluru"" is affected, and all attempts should be made to protect the pride of the city at the international level.

""During our tenure, we had identified the encroachment and measures were taken to clear most encroachments on storm water drains. If merciless action against the encroachers had continued, such a situation wouldn't have arisen.... BJP is responsible for the havoc,"" Siddaramaiah said.

Speaking to reporters here, he said Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai has blamed the previous Congress governments for the mess, but the BJP government should reveal what they did in the last three years; how many encroachments on the storm water drains have been cleared.

Now perhaps when you say the word Bangalore, the first word that comes to mind is traffic jams. A city where chopper services are available to take you from the airport to the town. A city which is more dug up than Mohenjo-daro and Harappan sites.

Let’s do this as a thought experiment: a decade ago, if you asked people to react to the word Bangalore, what kind of images came to mind? A city with tech companies that recruits students from far away engineering colleges of India and accords them the middle-class respectability of an MNC employee? A city with breweries serving beers that go beyond the typical Indian definition of ‘strong’ and ‘light’? A city with such good weather where you don’t need to buy an AC? A city with better music taste where pubs are still untouched by the attack of T-Series remixes?

In his book Invisible Cities, Italo Calvino writes, “Cities, like dreams, are made of desires and fears, even if the thread of their discourse is secret, their rules are absurd, their perspectives deceitful, and everything conceals something else.” What does Bangalore conceal and reveal? Is the city’s identity only limited to nightmarish traffic with beautiful weather? A city that is exploding by the stress of hosting the migrant population? If Delhi is defined as a brash city and Mumbai a dream city that never sleeps, how do we define the personality of Bangalore?

You are the traffic you crib about

Any city can’t be defined merely by inconvenience because cities are also a centre of language, people, culture, food, memories and a shared sense of space that binds them together in a very abstract sense. Many of my local friends from Bangalore hate the consistent cribbing of North Indians about traffic and other city problems. Many, in fact, fondly remember the era when this town was so sleepy and peaceful that some people claim that perhaps R.K. Narayan’s fictional town Malgudi was created by joining the two areas in Bangalore; Basavanagudi and Malleswaram. In his autobiography, R.K. Narayan writes, “As I sat in a room nibbling at my pen and wondering what to write, Malgudi with its little railway station swam into view, all ready-made, with a character called Swaminathan running down the platform. The station had a banyan tree, a station master, and two trains a day, one coming, one going.”

If R.K. Narayan were alive and stayed in Bangalore, he might have created a fictional town sitting in a noisy and overcrowded Third Wave Coffee joint. His lead character Swami would brainstorm about cryptocurrency and Web 3.0 over the cup of sea salt mocha as the slow and reverbed low-fi version of Malgudi Days played in the background.

The dichotomy

Many believe that one of the adjectives that fit Bangalore is that it is a ‘humble city’. A city that takes pride in the simplicity that also shows in the popular icons that came out from the Karnataka capital. For instance, one of the most humble mascots of the city is Rahul Dravid, who popularised the idea of building the wall way before Donald Trump. Superstar Rajinikanth, also known for his humility, worked as a bus conductor in Bangalore before he entered the cinema and defied the laws of physics through his stunts.

Another humble cricketer Anil Kumble is from Bangalore. One of the defining cricketing images of Anil Kumble is emerging from the pavilion, ready to bowl, his face wrapped in the bandage during a Test match in West Indies. He was due to fly back to Bangalore the following day for the surgery, and said, “At least I can now go home with the thought that I tried my best.” This is the kind of Indian style of ‘work workshop ethics’ that any startup owner would want their employee to follow. Just the way, sometimes, many delivery startups account proudly post pictures of their delivery guys, half-drowned in flood, hustling to deliver the Meghana Biryani to a hungry techie sitting in his jockey boxers inside the apartment in Whitefield.

Founder of Infosys and father-in-law of UK PM Rishi Sunak, Narayana Murthy always took pride in militant humility. Murthy’s humble style inspired many Indians, including Indians who are rich enough, to find a philosophical defence of their miser behaviour in the word ‘austerity’. Productivity-obsessed Murthy said during the pandemic that ‘Indians should work for 60 hours a week for next 2-3 years to revive the economy.’ This had made many Indians angry, even those who till a few years back, might have pasted this as an inspirational quote on their wall. But now, when the concept of ‘chill’ and ‘self-care’ has gained currency in the neo-liberal world, this quote creates a surgical strike on happiness. Bangalore city is also home to the ‘King of Good times’ Vijay Mallya, who doesn’t espouse any kind of humility and believes in living life king-size. In a way, Mallya is antithetical to Murthy.

The point of this argument is that perhaps, there isn’t any single characteristic to define a city, and like any migrant city, Bangalore is also a city of contrasts.

This dichotomy of Bangalore can also be seen through its food culture. Only a search of Brahmin food on Google can give you results of more than 30 restaurants and cafes. India’s Silicon Valley perhaps has not gotten rid of the open display of caste names that denotes the symbols of ‘purity.’ Caste 1.0 exists right under Web 3.0.

But there also lies the contrast. Bangalore is not a city where many take pride in the morality of being a pure vegetarian. This business of purity in food is, however, inadvertently countered by so many steakhouses and cafes in in the city that serve the kinds of meats which may have attracted an uninvited visit of Bajrang Dal if it were in Northern India.

In my latest podcast with Vijeta Kumar, who teaches English at St. Joseph’s College, I asked her why Bangalore doesn’t have a distinct personality like a city like Chennai or Mumbai. She replied, “perhaps it is good that cities don’t have an intrinsic distinct personality because that means that it is unwillingly accommodative of people who come from other cities.”

But despite all such characteristics, it can’t be argued that this beautiful garden city has been converted into an urban nightmare. At the moment, Bangalore is crushing by the weight of its own growth, and no one seems to have any answer to it. A better metaphor for Bangalore city would be a shy kid who is expected to be an extrovert. As if Roger Waters from Pink Floyd is asked to sing a song by Neha Kakkar.

Something about the current Bangalore doesn’t quite fit in, and one couldn’t actually make out the feel of the city. Philosopher Gilles Deleuze wrote about the term ‘any space whatsoever’, which refers to ‘unimportant’ urban space such as a metro, a doctor’s waiting room, or an airport terminal. These aren’t the ‘real’ spaces, and these are more of transit places where one passes between home and work. These are the spaces where individual become depersonalized and doesn’t feel any sense of space. The current state of Banglore is that the entire city feels ‘any space whatsoever.’ A transit space where one feels the experience of the whole city as if one is sitting inside the airport waiting room where the walls are crumbling down, and the television is playing the visuals of moving clouds in the loop.

Bangalore, a city where they talk a lot about Artificial Intelligence, is failed by the basic intelligence of its authorities. Or perhaps the greed of the authorities who are destroying the city in a very humble way.

In a bid to find a long-term solution to flooding in Bengaluru, Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Monday announced that a master plan with an end-to-end approach would be evolved, not only to manage the existing storm-water drains and build new ones, but also link them with the Cauvery through Dakshina Pinakini.

Replying to a debate in the Legislative Assembly on the recent floods in Bengaluru owing to heavy rains, the Chief Minister said the proposed master plan would take into account the survey and study reports by Institutions, such as the IISc., on storm-water drains in Bengaluru.

Various agencies

The BBMP, the BMRDA, and the BDA would be involved in preparation of the master plan, he said, while indicating that aspects related to storm-water drains in the earlier master plan would be redrawn.

He explained that Bengaluru’s drainage system was distributed over three concentric circles. While the inner circle located at a high elevation had well-developed storm-water drains as it belonged to the core part of the city, the middle circle that comprised city municipal councils, which were added in 2006, had the problem of encroachments, and underdeveloped and narrow storm-water drains in some stretches.

The outer circle comprising 110 villages that were recently added to Bengaluru needed infrastructural upgrade as storm-water drains were yet to be built in this zone, he said.

However, there was a need to look beyond the outer circle comprising these villages by linking the storm-water drains there that carry the entire city’s water with the Cauvery if the city needs a permanent solution to flooding during heavy rains, he observed.

The Chief Minister also announced constitution of a special task force comprising experts to monitor maintenance of storm-water drains in the core areas of the city, development and widening of storm-water drains in the middle circle represented by the earlier city municipal councils and building new storm-water drains in the peripheral areas besides linking the entire drainage system with Cauvery river.

Putting a system in place would ensure continuity of policies related to storm water drains irrespective of which party is in power, he said.

Measures would be taken to prevent mixing of sewage with storm-water drains, he said, while stating that capacity of the present sewage treatment plants would be increased to recycle the sewage water in Bengaluru.

He said he would instruct officials concerned to extend the present work that is being undertaken in a few areas to prevent mixing of sewage with storm water to all areas of the city.

Karnataka High Court stay blamed

Refuting the allegations of the Opposition that the BJP dispensation had failed to continue the drive to clear encroachments of storm-water drains, he said the drive had been suspended following the Karnataka High Court’s stay issued during the pandemic period. However, the drive had been taken up again now as the court had vacated the stay, he said and asserted that there was no question of stopping the drive.

₹600 crore for Bengaluru’s rain-hit infrastructure

Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai announced a grant of ₹600 crore as an immediate allocation for rebuilding Bengaluru’s rain-hit infrastructure. Of this, ₹300 crore would be used for rebuilding roads while another ₹300 crore would be used for developing storm water drains, he said.",solution,Bengaluru Floods 2022,"Bengaluru, Karnataka, India","September 20, 2022","September 21, 2022",Bengaluru city,100 mm,"Damage to roads, buildings, and infrastructure",0,Major disruption to traffic and daily life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

This time, the 2-km stretch of the Panathur RUB (railway under bridge) junction remained choked with traffic for over two and a half hours Wednesday morning, leaving around 100 school kids stranded.

The stretch is a key link that connects Kadubeesanahalli on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) and Varthur.

According to the members of the Varthur Rising and Namma Balagere volunteer groups, students who boarded school buses from Balagere Main road and travelled towards Outer Ring Road and Varathur missed their classes. They added that some of the students panicked and started crying.

On Wednesday late evening, the parents and students held a candlelight protest march to voice their concerns and pleaded with the Basavaraj Bommai-led government to expand the roads in order to decongest the traffic at the Panathur RUB junction.

The residents said that the stretch (Panathur RUB), which is not more than 15 feet, needs an immediate expansion. It is important to note that some residential buildings along the route have shrunk the size of the road.

Jagadish Reddy, a member of the Varthur Rising group, said, “The traffic on this route starts as early as 6:30 am and the police reach only by 9 am. The traffic congestion reaches its peak after 7 am. The residents of this area have been demanding an expansion of the road for years but some independent houses along this route are deterring the works. As a result, we are facing the brunt of heavy traffic every day.” What makes things worse on this stretch is that the road is filled with potholes, making it difficult for motorists to drive.

Sangappa Misra, a techie residing in Balagere, said, “The government is yet to assure compensation for the residents of independent houses and some shops who have occupied space along the stretch. We can expand the roads only after the occupiers are shifted and compensated. This request to expand the roads has been pending on the Chief Minister’s table for nearly five years.”

Venkata Ramanjaneyalu, father of 8-year-old Lochan Sai, said, “My son’s school is just 2 km away from our place and Wednesday, it took nearly 3 hours to reach because of the traffic. Some localities even distributed biscuits to the school children stranded in the buses. My son missed the first two hours of school because of the traffic. It is such a pain that for a distance of just 2 km, my children have to leave the house at least an hour before the school starts. The BBMP has been giving false promises for many years on expanding the road, but there has been no progress.”

Some residential complexes have deployed their private security guards to untangle the traffic mess in the morning so that children do not miss school. Others have decided to drop their children to school on two-wheelers.

BBMP commissioner Tushar Giri Nath said, “We have allocated Rs 11.5 crore for the acquisition of up to 12 metre of land to expand the road at the RUB junction. Technically, we need at least 18 metre of land for expansion but the occupiers are not ready to give up their land. We are also working on an alternative road which will give a permanent solution to the traffic congestion but for the time being, we will procure land and take up the work to widen the road. Meanwhile, the fund for compensation has been sanctioned and I will request the local authorities to start the work of acquiring land at the earliest.”

Traffic movement on the busy Bengaluru-Mysuru highway was disrupted for hours on Saturday after low-lying areas of the highway were inundated with rain water at multiple locations. Police say traffic flow — which was in higher volumes due to the weekend — was affected from 5 a.m. and the impact continued till afternoon.

At Kumbalgodu, Kaniminke lake overflowed, inundating the service road. This resulted in the traffic piling up for miles. At Inorupalya, the newly built toll gates were seen flooded with the rainwater disrupting traffic flow. At Channapatna, Ramammankere breached its bund and flooded the highway roads.

As the vehicles piled up for miles, police diverted the traffic. Motorists going from Bengaluru towards Mandya were asked to take Magadi Road or take Bengaluru-Hassan Highway to reach Kunigal, from there travel towards Mandya. Motorists coming from Mysuru Road were asked to reach Kanakapura Road from Malavalli or take Kunigal route to reach Bengaluru.

Superintendent of Police of Ramangara K. Sanotsh Babu told The Hindu that traffic diversion will be in place till Monday. “This region received incessant rain continuously for a week. On Saturday, weekend traffic moving from Bengaluru and moving towards Mysuru was stuck after rain water flooded the service lanes of the highway at multiple locations. We had to impose the traffic diversion to ease the traffic flow and the diversion will be in place till Monday. We have requested Google to show the diversion map for the benefit of the motorists and also will place signages at the important junctions.”

The IMD on Saturday forecasted a generally cloudy sky. Few spells of light to moderate Rain or thundershowers are very likely in Bengaluru with maximum and minimum temperatures very likely to be around 27 and 20 degrees Celsius respectively for another 24 hours. Mr. Babu said that the authorities are also contemplating opening the bypass in Bidadi and bypass between Ramanagara and Channapanta to lessen the congestion on the road if situations like flooding repeats. “At present, the road works are in progress between Ramanagara and Channapatna. The NHAI will do the safety audit and further decisions will be taken on allowing the traffic,” said the official.

Heavy rainfall and lakes breaching bunds affected villages in Ramanagaram and Channapatna. Agricultural lands flooded with rain water. After Thittamaranahalli breached its bund, water entered around 30 homes in the area and residents were shifted to other places. In Gandhi Grama, rain water entered around 20 houses.

Addressing a media conference after chairing a meeting to review the rescue and relief works in the flood-affected districts of Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Uttara Kannada, Bommai said, the situation would be reviewed again in August and necessary funds will be released.

Bommai added, “Officials of the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Relief Force (SDRF), the district administration and the legislators are ready to take up relief work on a war-footing. Last year, Rs 1,600 crore was paid within a month to compensate the farmers for a total loss of crop on 14 lakh hectare land. This year too, the compensation will be released immediately.”

“We will request for central assistance to take up relief works after getting reports on the extent of damage in the districts,” Bommai said.

Flood damage in districts

Mysuru, Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu, Udupi and Karwar regions have received heavy rains in the month of July. So far, 32 people have died, five have gone missing, 34 are injured, about 300 people have been shifted to safer places, 14 care centres have been opened and four NDRF and SDRF teams have been deployed for rescue and relief works. Crops on about 216 hectare of land have been destroyed in Dakshina Kannada district and 129 hectare in Udupi district. As for houses, 58 have been totally destroyed, 26 are heavily damaged and 1,062 houses are partially damaged, Bommai said.

Damaged roads

About 2,187 km of roads, including PWD and rural roads, have been damaged. Of this, 727 km of damaged roads are in Dakshina Kannada, 500 km in Uttara Kannada and 960 km in Udupi.

Disrupted power supply

About 5,595 electric poles have been uprooted which has affected the power supply in the three districts. Work is on to restore power while 422 transformers are being repaired.

Although NDRF norms prescribe Rs 3,200 compensation for house collapse as an immediate relief, the state government is giving Rs 10,000. Damage to houses has been categorised as A, B and C according to the extent of damage. For category A, Rs 5 lakh is being provided as compensation for completely destroyed houses, Rs 3 lakh for category B of extensively damaged houses and Rs 50,000 for category C — partially destroyed houses. “The figures are much more than the sum fixed by the Union government at Rs 95,000 for category A and B and Rs 5,000 for category C,” Bommai said.

Farm input subsidy

For loss of crops, the NDRF has fixed an input subsidy of Rs 6,800 per hectare for dry land crops but the state government pays Rs 13,600. Similarly, this year too, Rs 13,600 will be paid as farm input subsidy per hectare, said Bommai. For wetland crops, Rs 25,000 will be paid per hectare as against the input subsidy of Rs 13,500 fixed by the Union government. For horticulture crops, the Union government provides an input subsidy of Rs 18,000 per hectare, while the state government is giving Rs 28,000 to help the farmers, Bommai said.

Care Centres

A solatium of Rs 4 lakh has been provided by the Union government for the families of those killed. However, the state government has raised it to Rs 5 lakh. “Those sheltered in care centres are being provided with nutritious meals which include eggs,” Bommai said.

Study of tremors

Referring to the frequent tremors in Kodagu and coastal regions, Bommai said the Geological Survey of India and universities of Bengaluru and Mysuru have been asked to study the phenomenon and submit a report. “Appropriate measures will be taken based on the report for the safety of the people,” the Chief Minister said.

A team of experts from Amrita University is studying the causes of landslides in Kodagu. They have been asked to conduct similar studies in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Uttara Kannada and Malnad areas too, Bommai informed.

Sea erosion

Referring to the problem of sea erosion, Bommai said, though a programme to prevent sea erosion has been implemented with ADB funding of Rs 300 crore, the results are not satisfactory. “A ‘Sea Wave Breaker’ technology would be tried on an experimental basis along a 1 km coast at Ullala. It will be extended to the entire coast if found successful.

Last week, one-third of Pakistan was submerged due to catastrophic monsoons, and the city of Jackson, Miss., announced a health emergency after heavy rains damaged a water treatment plant. In India, the city of Bengaluru was also reeling from flooding. Lifeboats rescued residents from inundated apartments in this metropolis of 13 million in the southern Indian state of Karnataka. And fish appeared on highways as rain continued to batter the city.

U.N. Secretary General António Guterres called the extreme rains this summer “a monsoon on steroids.” News stories spotlighted the fact that vulnerable countries are not major drivers of global warming. Pakistan, for instance, accounts for no more than 0.5 percent of global carbon emissions, yet 33 million people have been impacted by this year’s heat waves and heavy rains, with authorities predicting secondary disasters like disease outbreaks and food shortages.

But this narrative tends to focus primarily on torrential monsoons and droughts, and excludes how rainfall events interact with local political and economic factors — especially those to do with real estate capitalism and corruption. My research suggests this mix can also have disastrous effects.

Rapid economic gains encouraged risky real estate moves

Bengaluru, formerly known as Bangalore, is “India’s Silicon Valley.” English-speaking engineers drive India’s tech industry, and a call center workforce drawn from across the country provides cheap services for hundreds of multinational companies headquartered in Europe and America. Indian policymakers actively promote the city’s “IT/BT” (information technology/biotechnology) economy — and that’s had an outsize effect on the local housing market. White-collar workers helped make Bengaluru’s real estate sector one of the most profitable in the country, but also largely unaffordable for the city’s majority working-class residents.

The city’s residential and commercial development has a longer history of agrarian caste and class power relations — which means feudal landowners were able to cash in on rapid urbanization by converting farmland and wetland into urban real estate. The undulating and rain-fed Deccan region is traversed by centuries-old lakes and wetlands (keres) connected by a gravity-fed latticework of rivulets and canals (raja kaluves). Technically, the government owns the area in and around these canals, known as kharab-B land (literally, wasteland). For all practical purposes, however, anyone with the right connections and muscle power can claim and build on this land.

Developers and land brokers were thus able to grab “free” parcels of watery land, aiming to cover the waterways and storm drains and sell off the land, often informally and without the requisite permissions.

City engineers that I spoke to explained that often residents are not aware that their houses are sitting on or blocking a storm water drain. Developers leveled the land and covered drains with mud, increasing the area to be sold off. This is how an area becomes flood prone.

Through this process, developers constructed both higher-end apartment buildings and IT parks, as well as substandard subdivisions without municipal infrastructure largely for the city’s lower-class buyers and renters. The Karnataka government itself legally drained and concretized dozens of wetlands and canals throughout the 20th century for sports stadiums and other public projects. This encouraged private developers to follow suit, despite efforts since the early 2000s to ban lake conversion and conserve wetlands.

‘Land mafias’ profited from these deals

Share this article Share

For the past decade, I have been researching informal urbanization and the real estate “mafias” that deal in Bengaluru’s (wet)land and water markets. This isn’t about gun-toting gangsters, necessarily — instead, the term describes the close collaboration, colloquially referred to as a corrupt “nexus,” between bureaucrats, builders, landowners and other intermediaries involved in urban real estate deals in flood-prone areas.

It’s an approach to land development that has become common throughout much of the world: developers literally conjure property from water. In Bengaluru, even moderate rainfall can cause overflowing lakes that overwhelm the city’s storm water drainage and flood the streets. Residents of these areas are particularly vulnerable to flooding — and to the subsequent government efforts to address the flooding.

Watchdog groups claim that government development boards actively sanction development on sensitive lake land by bypassing environmental and infrastructural clearances. When activists and lawyers bring infractions to light, officials legalize the projects after the fact. Other critics claim the “land mafia” is working at the highest levels to thwart fines for bending the rules and to pay off politicians and judges to rule in developers’ favor.

The urban poor pay the price

The city government quickly announced an encroachment removal drive after Bengaluru’s latest round of flooding, which typically results in the demolition of the homes of poorer and less politically connected groups. With its roots in colonial law, the term “encroachment” in India describes an illicit advance on government land, including lakes and wetlands. In the aftermath of the economic development wave since the early 1990s, when the Indian government pursued increasingly liberal policies to boost economic growth, officials strategically avoid encroachment removal efforts aimed at the wealthy, and instead direct them at less politically connected groups. This results in the demolition of slums and housing inhabited by Dalit (oppressed caste) workers, slum dwellers and migrant laborers. It effectively calls out these groups, their actions and, indeed, their personhood, as illegal “encroachers.”

But land grabs and land development are very much an organized process involving powerful private and government organizations — not India’s urban poor. Analysts point out that global corporations and developers created the Orion Mall, Bagmane Tech Park and Mantri Special Economic Zone — all located in areas with heightened flood risk. These types of projects could not have happened without the involvement of government officials, and their luxury developers are seldom punished for any encroachments.

There is a parallel here in terms of this week’s disaster response: Much of the media attention in India has focused on flood-related losses within the city’s tech corridor, with less coverage of the plight of some 1,500 slum dwellers nearby in need of shelter and assistance after their homes flooded in a second round of heavy rains.

The disasters of summer 2022 point out the inequalities of global climate change at the national level. The Bengaluru story sheds light on the uneven nature of climate-related culpability and vulnerability at the local level. It also tells us that efforts at the local and national level to address flood risk will benefit from a better understanding of how climate factors intersect with the history and political economy of real estate capitalism.

The floods have abated in Bengaluru. As individuals struggle to clean their houses, the silt on the roads left behind by the receding water — now a fine dust that flies in the air choking us — is a reminder of those difficult times.

Various analyses now attribute Bengaluru’s flooding to more rainfall — in the future, it is expected to increase to an average of 1,000 mm per annum from the current 650 mm per annum — and unplanned, overcrowded growth that is destroying the greenery, tanks and wetlands.

Clearly, we must decongest the city, plant more trees, save wetlands, even reclaim them, desilt drains, enlarge sewers, deconcretise pavements and stop the clogging of waterways with unsegregated garbage. The State government announced tough measures such as the demolition of unauthorised encroachments impeding drainage streams in the city, but quickly backed away. It now plans to divert drains to avoid already built-up areas. This is not a solution because nature will carry on inundating encroachments until people abandon them of their own volition.

The ‘grease’ of the system

Everybody has a favourite villain to blame — from the builder mafia to the migrant, from the lack of spatial planning to uncontrolled violations of building bye-laws. Yet, the herd of restive elephants in the room is led by a particularly malevolent matriarch: corruption.

Everybody decries corruption outwardly, but submits to it meekly. Fear apart, it is also a matter of convenience, of time saved and of benefits, often through the violation of rules. Some justify corruption as the grease that keeps the fast-growing economic engine of Bengaluru whirring smoothly. However, corruption cripples economic growth in ways not readily apparent. Apart from transferring inordinate wealth to the undeserving, it creates a slew of vested interests, who resist anti-corruption process reforms. Understanding how corrupt officials, politicians, regulators and private players act in concert is essential to successfully implementing corruption-reducing strategies. Further, we must understand that the corrupt often use the honest to further their subversive agendas. Examples abound.

Most game theories concerning the dynamics of corruption reveal that the original sinner is often, paradoxically, a well-intentioned government. A good, but misguided government could make narrowly rigid rules, thus giving venal politicians and bureaucrats the leeway to bend them. For example, building bye-laws are so labyrinthine that the strictest law-abiding citizen cannot comply with them. That provides opportunities for agents who bypass the system’s rigidities. Ironically then, corruption actually reduces red tape. Hence, not many complain about resorting to bribing to get work done through a parallel, ‘efficient’ system.

One could also have a good government that aims to reduce red tape, making overly lax rules capable of being interpreted differently. In this ‘anything goes’, system, frontline officials invent discretionary practices to create impediments and seek bribes. ‘You show me your face, and I’ll show you the rule,’ is an old and cynical adage.

The loopholes

Next, our narrow, legal definition of corruption enables many in a corrupt system to escape culpability. Indian law recognises only corrupt acts by public servants to be ‘acts of corruption’ under the law. As private corruption is not criminalised, many government actions are outsourced to private agents, who collect ‘handling fees’ on behalf of their partners in crime within the government. Witness builders’ agents, who collect bribes openly to have properties registered, even as the government IT enable such processes, aiming at efficiency and honesty.

E-Governance is often not the effective solution as claimed. E-enabled systems often only relocate the locus of corruption; they do not solve all of it. Large databases, such as land records, when moved to paperless systems are vulnerable to manipulation. Encroachments are enabled when old records are destroyed and new ones are created. Power shifts from land administrators to the one who possesses the digital signature. The data entry operator becomes an all-important and corruptible cog in the wheel.

How then do we tackle corruption? How do we destroy the entrenched resistance to true reforms, which harmonises citizen and collective interest in protecting the environment and promoting a healthy economy? Worldwide experience reveals no easy way out. The battle against networks of corrupt interests of politicians, bureaucrats, the private sector and regulators, has been a hard fought one. There are uneasy transitions and fake equilibriums in this battle of attrition; the corrupt do not cede ground easily.

Kick-start these strategies

Successful anti-corruption strategies rely on actions across three fronts.

First, regular assessments and evaluations of ongoing anti-corruption measures, eliminate the possibility of declaring false victories. They help in red-flagging new corruption opportunities, even as old ones are eliminated. A cycle of ongoing process reforms gets initiated.

Second, a genuine regime of whistle-blower protection assures honest citizens, politicians, bureaucrats and judges of protection, as they otherwise fear the adverse repercussions for uncovering illegal activities. Whistle-blowers today are exposed to danger. They draw attention to themselves and are vulnerable to attacks, ranging from character assassination, to counter accusations, to physical harm. Confidence-assuring whistle-blower protection measures can lead to exposure of more corruption, particularly at higher levels. Swift punishment of the guilty, could instil a sense of fear and reduce the feeling of impunity that the corrupt enjoy.

Third, there has to be a conscious move towards promoting ethical behaviour. Unfortunately, moral science education has been tainted by religious colours; but surely, are we not able to develop agnostic, religion-neutral ways of educating young people to be empathetic, kind, mindful of their larger responsibilities to the community, be honest, and intolerant of corruption?

All these strategies have been tried successfully in countries and cultures that have been able to reduce corruption substantially. This in turn has translated into better quality of services, and thus, a better quality of life. In turn, this nurtures creativity and bolsters the economy. Surely, Bengaluru deserves such a future.

However, there is one necessary ingredient remaining, going by the experience of cities and countries that have cleaned up their acts. If anti-corruption strategies are to be successful, the process needs enlightened leadership. No extent of process changes will succeed if the leadership — it need not be a single leader, but a network of high-ranking individuals cutting across the government and non-government sectors — is corrupt or insincere. In a democracy, waiting for such a leadership to emerge miraculously from so-called benevolent dictators is wishful thinking. The emergence of such a leadership depends upon us.

Indian tech hub Bangalore has been inundated by floodwater after torrential downpours that have killed scores of people across the country's south in the past few weeks.

Lakes dotted around the city have overflowed after three days of ferocious rain, submerging roads and flooding homes.

Rescuers deployed inflatable life rafts to retrieve stranded residents while buses and motorised rickshaws carted commuters through knee-deep water.

""We can't go inside our house because the water has stagnated in front of it,"" Bangalore resident Rathnamma told AFP on Monday.

""All our groceries are inside and we have been stuck outside the house since 10 o'clock last night,"" she added.

Experts say unpredictable and extreme weather across South Asia is being driven by climate change, exacerbated by damming, deforestation and excessive development.

Many roads have been left submerged by the flooding in Bangalore.

At least 30 people have been killed after flash floods around southern India in recent days, according to local media reports.

Another 42 died last month when heavy rains pummelled the coastal state of Kerala, prompting authorities to suspend an annual pilgrimage to Sabarimala, site of one of Hinduism's holiest shrines.

A week of pounding rains also hit the city of Chennai earlier in November, flooding most main roads and uprooting trees.

Deputy Chief Minister Govind M Karjol said that losses to the tune of Rs 550 crore have been recorded in Belagavi alone as per initial estimates. “I have requested Chief Minister Yediyurappa to release Rs 50 crore on an immediate basis,” he said after assessing the flood situation at Mudhol taluk in Bagalkot district.

Meanwhile, the CM directed all district in-charge ministers and MLAs to be present in their respective districts and constituencies to oversee rescue and relief efforts. “The state government will extend all necessary support and assist farmers who suffered losses due to untimely rain and hailstorms,” he said in a statement. Yediyurappa is scheduled to conduct an aerial survey of Belagavi, the worst-hit district in the state, on Sunday.

At the same time, the Indian Naval Emergency Response Team that arrived from Karwar successfully carried out an operation to evacuate 160 people from two villages that were totally inundated in Uttara Kannada district.

In addition, heavy rain in Chikodi and Nipani taluk of Belagavi have caused heavy flooding in the Krishna river and its tributaries. Rajapura barrage of Maharashtra is releasing 58000 cusecs per day into the river following heavy inflow from the ghat areas. Doodh Ganga river is also in spate and releasing 19,000 cusecs in the river into the lower riparian course.

As a consequence of heavy inflow in the rivers, 6 bridges have been submerged in the Krishna river course. Pandora, Kaneri, Kali rivers are under heavy flooding and 120 villages in 4 districts are inundated.

Remarkably, Kali river has also experienced heavy inflow. This is for the first time in the last few years that the river has released 40,000 cusecs into its course. Besides, Gangavali river is also in spate and creating flood situation in low lying areas in Ankola taluk . A transport link has been severed between Yellapur and Ankola consequently.

Railways have not been spared either by the effect of incessant and heavy rainfall. Konkan Railway that connects Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka has cancelled many trains.

Rains this year have thrown life out of gear in many parts of the State, including Bengaluru. This calendar year, Bengaluru Urban district has received rainfall of 1128 mm to date. This is an excess of over 30% of the normal annual rainfall of 843 mm. Where does all this rainwater go?

Let’s look at Bengaluru’s geography to understand this. Bengaluru sits on a ridge, at an altitude of 920 m above sea level. The city is part of two sub-basins — Cauvery and Ponnaiyar. In the eastern part, rainwater runoff flows into the Ponnaiyar river sub-basin through Bellandur and Varthur tanks (which are part of the Koramangala & Challagatta valley) and Hebbal valley. In the western part, the runoff flows into the Cauvery river sub-basin through its two tributaries – the Vrishabhavati and Arkavathi rivers. Numerous tanks have been built on this course that spill over and eventually join the river.

Headwater streams

‘Headwater streams’ are the uppermost streams in the river network, which form the beginnings of a river and are furthest from its endpoint. Several such headwater streams join one another, and form parts of the river and stream networks. They play a critical role by trapping floodwaters, recharging groundwater and also carrying water to the downstream rivers.

From a hydrology perspective, streams, tributaries and rivers are organised based on a hierarchical system called ‘Strahler number’. A stream flowing at the source of the river is usually the first order. When two such first-order streams join, they become a second-order stream. Similarly, several streams make up a larger one resulting in higher orders. A river could be seen when the stream is of the fourth or fifth order.

An example of a first-order stream in Bengaluru is a spring you could spot near Kadu Malleshwara temple in Malleshwaram. Before Bengaluru urbanised, such a stream would flow down naturally to higher-order streams. (Streams are different from roadside drains, which are engineered structures.)

Bengaluru’s natural streams have been engineered into drains

At Gubbi Labs, we undertook a study in 2014 to assess the status of headwater streams in Bengaluru. To establish the reference layer, we used the ‘Tank Map of Bangalore Taluk’ circa 1920.

‘Tank Map of Bangalore Taluk’ circa 1920.

Using GIS tools, the tanks and streams were digitised to derive a map (below). The map revealed that, around 1920, the current BBMP jurisdiction had about 1309 streams with a total length of 793.8 km.

We further classified the streams based on their orders. The total length of all first-, second-, third-, fourth-, and fifth-order streams were 535.2 km, 181.6 km, 60.6 km, 8.6 km and 7.8 km, respectively.

We wanted to find out what happened to these streams and tanks. Based on BBMP’s current Storm Water Drain map as well as satellite data from Bing, we categorised the current status of the streams (now also drains) as Open, Covered, Altered, and Disappeared/Untraceable.

The following map indicates the status of streams in 2014.

The analysis (see chart below) revealed that less than 8% of the first-order streams were open, about 13% were covered, 19% altered, and about 60% have either disappeared or were untraceable. About 27% of the second-order streams were untraceable. Though the third-, fourth-, and fifth-order streams remained, about 30% of them are either covered or altered, or both.

Stormwater drains are under the purview of the BBMP. They have conveniently ensured that several roadside drains lead to larger drains, which in turn lead to second- or higher order streams.

If the drains were channeling storm water alone, there is no reason for BBMP to intervene and build concrete structures over them. It turns out that Bengaluru has poor coverage of domestic sewage collection. This has resulted in households in connivance with BBMP letting sewage off into streams that have now eventually become drains. The Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) is responsible for ensuring that sewage does not enter into streams, but has failed to do so.

With unchecked inflow of sewage into streams, BBMP is promptly attempting to conceal them as part of their ‘Master Plan for Remodelling of Storm Water Drains’, which is a recipe for disaster.

Also, several streams have been cut short or built over in the name of ‘development’. The severe abuse of natural streams by encroaching, altering and covering them through engineered structures is a concern.

In extreme rainfall events like cloudbursts, or even a continuous spell of rainfall like the one Bengaluru received a couple of months ago, rainwater will naturally flow wherever there is lower elevation, by following the natural drainage pattern – the first, second, third, and then the higher-order streams. At locations where the first-order or second-order streams are abused, naturally the run-off may not discharge into the respective tank, and the result would be local flooding.

Although there has been some effort to ‘protect’ Bengaluru’s tanks, unless the headwater streams are restored and conserved, proper inflow to and outflow from the tanks is not possible. Tanks can’t be protected only by securing their periphery; the first, second, third and higher order streams should also be restored and protected.

Legal conundrum

Let’s examine why so many first-order streams disappeared or became untraceable over a span of a few decades.

No legal sanctity for first-order streams

First-order streams do not have legal sanctity like tanks do – as a parcel of land with a designated survey number. In other words, many headwater streams are not recorded in revenue records or maps; only higher-order streams like rajakaluves are.

This is because the Karnataka Land Revenue Act of 1964 doesn’t recognise headwater streams. In the absence of such recognition, any abuse of these natural headwater streams cannot be mitigated. Further, if one owns a parcel of land that has a stretch of first-order stream passing through, they are free to cover or alter it. Since there is no legal framework ensuring the protection of the stream, the person cannot be held liable for this.

Hence, an amendment to the Karnataka Land Revenue Act to recognise headwater streams, at least going forward, would be critical.

State’s planning law too doesn’t recognise streams

A review of drain remodelling projects undertaken by BBMP and BWSSB reveals that they have been successful in engineering these streams that have now become drains. Thus, in many ways, floods in Bengaluru are an engineered artefact.

The State, of course, has an overarching planning law like the Karnataka Town and Country Planning (KTCP) Act of 1961. But, apart from being a dated law, it has several shortcomings on how a master plan needs to be prepared. (The Revised Master Plan 2015 is currently valid for Bengaluru.)

The KTCP Act doesn’t take note of headwater streams, but only land use. Importantly, the master planning exercise, done as per the Act, results in static, geometrically well-laid out plans without any forecasting capabilities. Instead of being a static document, a master plan should have dynamic land use forecasting (which is in vogue in the Netherlands). The system can also be open to the public so that everyone knows what changes are happening in which locations. This further calls for a new planning law that is responsive, dynamic and supports forecasting capabilities spatially.

In this day and age, when almost everything around us has changed, what has not changed are our laws. The number of progressive laws is only countable in the past couple of decades.

While amendments have been made to many existing laws, at best they have been regressive (Akrama-Sakrama is a classic example). Thought leadership is needed in the political setup to bring out a foresighted law that can stand for a couple of decades, if not a generation. With the timeline of law-making narrowing down these days, it remains to be seen when and how such a well-thought-out law will be made to plan and protect the city. Until then, we have to bear the brunt of our legally-engineered streams causing floods.

Despite complaints, this problem has not been fixed. On Friday, with sudden rains, the road resembled a large open storm water drain.Devatha Krishna, 83, a resident of Pipeline Road said, “We have been raising this issue for the last six months but there has been no improvement at all. Thehave to be cleaned but the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike () has not been doing it despite our complaints. We have been suffering the most as the drain water flows into our house almost every day. In the evening, it’s unbearable because it attracts mosquitoes. The smell is so bad it makes us gag. ”, 45, a resident ofsaid that the road is steep and it always had drainage issues during the rainy season and the sewage water would overflow onto the streets. “Pedestrians are afraid to walk here for fear that motorists will splash dirty water on them. Most of the vegetables and fruits shops are on Dattatreya temple road and we have to walk past this lane to get to them.”Swaroop, 21, another resident said that he had raised a complaint on the Sahaaya app but it was closed without being resolved. Sathyanarayan, former BBMP corporator said that the drainage work on the Dattatreya temple road was causing the leak and he was in touch with the contractor to complete the work as soon as possible.AEE Sumanth said the BBMP was de-silting drains in Sirur park and had temporarily shut the drainage which was leading to the overflow. “We will clear it soon and the work will be completed by June.”",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Fire department personnel, along with civic body officials, rescued residents stuck in waterlogged houses at Kendriya Vihar Apartment in Yelahanka, North Bengaluru, on Monday. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials said overflowing water from the Yelahanka lake nearby flooded the apartment.

BBMP Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said, “Kendriya Vihar apartment is in a low-lying area, next to Yelahanka Lake. We are now planning to construct a new 30-40 ft stormwater drain with RCC cement and concrete walls so that the water doesn’t flow into low-lying areas.”

Gupta said the BBMP has deployed several boats, besides SDRF and other teams, to provide emergency supplies to residents in the apartment. The civic body has now arranged milk, biscuits, candles, bread and drinking water facilities for the residents.

“Around 2 am last night, about 130 mm rain was recorded in Yelahanka Zone and the Yelahanka lake overflowed, flooding Kendriya Vihar Apartments. The water level rose to a height of four feet,” he explained.

The apartment has 604 flats and 1,600 residents. Eighteen NDRF teams used boats and tractors to ferry the residents out of the apartment. “We have ensured that no one faces any difficulties. The Palike’s Revenue Department officials have reached out to the homes and assessed the damages caused,” Gupta added.

Two hours of incessant rain flooded the entire basement of the apartment, said Chandrasekhar, a resident of the apartment. “Water is all over the apartment premises now, starting from the main gate. The BBMP officials are helping senior citizens and evacuating them to safer places,” he told The Indian Express.

A BBMP medical team with eight doctors has been stationed nearby. “A medical team, along with a basic life support ambulance, has been provided for the residents for medical emergencies. Residents can also use the ambulance to go to hospitals, if needed,” a BBMP senior official said.

Seethalaxmi, another resident, said her family is temporarily shifting to a relative’s place since there is no electricity at the apartment. “The situation is very bad. We have two elderly family members staying with us, so with the help of the rescue team, we are shifting to our relative’s house since there is no power supply or drinking water available,” she said.

A member of the rescue operation team from BBMP told The Indian Express that many are packing up and leaving. “Some people are evacuating their residences in the apartment, families are left with nothing. They had to pack whatever they had and leave,” he said. Residents complained that a few years ago, the apartment got flooded in a similar manner.

The waters here are currently being pumped out towards the stormwater drain (SWD) which connects Yelahanka lake to Jakkur lake. Officials said requests had been placed before the government seeking to increase the width of the drain from eight feet to 33 feet to prevent repeated flooding.

Pavani Residency in Yelahanka New Town also got inundated, with vehicles in the basement getting submerged in the floodwaters on Monday. Fire brigade officials later pumped out water from the area.

Incidentally, a report released by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India in the last week of September had given an inkling that this could happen. The report had highlighted the issue of encroachment of lakes in the city and the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) failure to link drains with Storm Water Drains (SWDs).

The CAG report titled ‘Performance Audit of Management of Storm Water in Bengaluru Urban Area’ showed that the shrinking of water bodies and drains has led to a loss of connectivity between the water bodies and the drains.

According to the report, the BBMP was yet to remove 714 encroachments out of the identified 2,626 encroachments near water bodies in various zones. The audit observed 23 cases of significant encroachments, of which 16 cases were not in the list provided by the BBMP. The CAG also observed that the report provided by the BBMP chief engineer of the lakes division was not reliable as joint inspection showed that one of the encroachments stated to have been removed continued to exist and the evictions carried out were also incomplete.

The joint inspection of drains showed that the SWDs were not directly connected to the water bodies, lakes in a few cases and the runoff was flowing into constructed deviation canals. This increased the chances of flash floods, the report said.

“The flow paths/beds of drains were concretised. This not only affected the hydrological functional ability of SWDs but also impacted groundwater recharge. Besides, concretisation of SWDs also aggravated vulnerability to frequent floods,” the report added.

The CAG also highlighted the issue of conversion and concretisation of water bodies. For instance, the Kamakshipalya lake has been turned into a sports ground and the Dasarahalli tank converted into the Dr BR Ambedkar stadium.

According to the data shared with the CAG by the chief engineer of the lakes division of the BBMP, of the 210 lakes/water bodies in Bengaluru, 66 were yet to be developed, 18 disused and 37 lakes were in the process of being rejuvenated. The 18 lakes that were reported to be in a state of disuse cover a total area of 254 acres. There is a significant chance of these lakes being encroached and converted for other uses in the future.

The report also stated that the failure of the BBMP to ensure linkage of drains with water bodies facilitated the drying up of a number of lakes in Bengaluru city, which, in turn, led to the conversion of lakes for other purposes.

According to CAG, SWD works estimated to cost Rs 61.21 crore were taken up specifically for sewage diversion and to improve environmental conditions near water bodies. The joint inspection showed that sewage was flowing invariably in all the stretches of drains and was also directly being discharged into lakes. This rendered the expenditure largely unproductive.

The heavyinfloodedtoo, and forced employees to return home from work.Manyata Tech Park is one of the city’s biggest tech parks and was flooded with about four feet of rainwater on Sunday night. The water gushed into the basement of buildings. A source said that the drain pipes burst due to the pressure and rainwater, mixed with sewage water, entered the buildings.The water is being pumped out using the fire hydrants used by firefighters. Each motor can pump out at least 5,000 to 10,000 litres per minute. However, the situation is not expected to be resolved soon.According to builders, it will take at least three days for all the water to get pumped out. It may be noted that the basement of a building was already filling up with rainwater before this incident and the fire department had already been at work at the tech park for the past week.Employees were shocked to see the waterlogging inside the building when they reached office on Monday. Of those who made it to work despite rain and traffic, many were asked to go back home. Many other office-goers were stuck as their vehicles were jammed due to the flooded roads.Considering the severity of the situation, many companies have asked employees to work from home for the time being. However, a few banking companies have decided to work from their offices, despite the incessant rainfall. A minibus service was organised to ferry these employees to work. Some employees were spotted trying to fish on their way to work as in such situations aquatic life often finds its way to the city.Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai told reporters on Monday that Rs 500 crore will be released to repair roads and bridges damaged due toin the state.

Karnataka will witness 10 to 25% increase in rainfall and areas under drought or drought years will decline drastically by mid-2030 and the increase in rainfall will be accompanied by larger magnitudes in the intensity and frequency of heavy rainfall and floods, according to N.H. Ravindranath and G. Bala, authors of multiple UN IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reports and professors at IISc., Bengaluru.

With the latest IPCC report estimating the chances of crossing the global warming level of 1.5°C in the next decades, Prof. Ravindranath and Prof. Bala said, “A district-level multi-model projection shows that rainfall is projected to increase by 10 to 25% in districts of Karnataka even by the mid-2030s.”

Focus areas

Besides coastal districts of the State, regions of the Krishna and the Cauvery basins will witness heavy rainfall in the coming years and the monsoon rainfall variability between years will increase with some years receiving very high rainfall and a few recording deficient rainfall. Karnataka has already been experiencing unprecedented floods in the recent years, they said.

Prof. Ravindranth told The Hindu that with global warming reaching 1.5-2° Celsius in the next two decades, high rainfall and rise in sea levels would be irreversible in the coming years. Shrinking glaciers, melting of ice sheets, rising seas, species loss, and more acidic oceans would be irreversible changes, he said.

“One-third of the biodiversity in the Western Ghats of Karnataka will be damaged by 2050 and there will be reduction in fish production in the sea because of acidic oceans,” said Prof. Ravindranath, who is also part of the Karnataka State Action Plan on Climate Change, 2021, report, which is yet to be made public.

Rainfall would be high intensity and rainfall would be 50 mm to 100 mm in one day or some days and it would be difficult to forecast monsoon in advance owing to global climatic change factors, Prof. Ravindranath said.

Authors said with regular years of rainfall, drought years would be fewer in the coming decades. The State governments have to focus on management of floods, particularly in urban areas and cities and storage of water in dams. “Bengaluru and many cities and towns have all experienced flood events in recent years and they will only intensify in the coming decades,” they said.

Damage to properties

Scientists have suggested to the government to undertake construction of railway network, bridges, building, and dams by taking into consideration changes in the climate. “Biggest problem,” according to them, “is management of water in the coming years.” Damage to public and private properties would be immense if authorities did not incorporate climate change in their policies, Prof. Ravindranath and Prof. Bala warned.

Dirty water entered homes and apartments aroundon Sunday after the retaining wall of the Koramangala and Challaghatta valley stormwater drain was broken for maintenance workA small gap between the retaining wall of the Koramangala and Challaghatta valley stormwater drain rendered a big shock to many residents of Ejipura and Koramangala as it left several residential areas flooded on Sunday evening.Such was the negligence of the authorities that the rainwater which was supposed to drain into Bellandur lake, gushed out of the drain flooding houses and apartments complexes. The places that were flooded are now filled with slush, silt and sewage.Some of the places that were greatly affected are residents of National Games Village (NGV), Koramangala 80 feet road and families living in and around Ejipura signal. While the water had drained out by Sunday night, many are struggling to remove the layers of slush that have covered the area.This is the second such incident where the gap between retaining wall had resulted in floods. A similar incident had taken place innear Ejipura a couple of years ago. “A lot of stormwater drain work is currently underway. This was not the time to cut open the wall. The engineers had an entire year to complete desilting and maintenance work,” said, a resident of Koramangala.Many residents living in National Games Village were unable to come out of their houses on Monday morning. The parking lots and the apartment premises were filled with slush. “It is pity to see the residential area flooded with rain and mud from the gutter. At least four blocks got affected with the dirty water and the entire premises was in two feet water. Cars are affected. Thehas done nothing to clear the area,” said Rahul Aulak, a resident of NGV.The civic body is blaming the(BWSSB) for the mess. “We had constructed a concrete retaining wall that was sufficient to tackle 50 to 75 mm of rainfall. The BWSSB engineers had broken a part of the wall to carry out maintenance work a week ago. This was not brought to our notice. We have filed a police complaint,” said BS Prahlad, Chief Engineer (stormwater drain) at BBMP.The complaint has been filed in the Koramangala police station against BWSSB engineers.BWSSB officials say that they did not expect such intense rainfall. “About 49 mm of rain was reported in just one hour. We have now kept sandbags and increased the height. We will rebuild the wall by tomorrow,” a senior BWSSB official said. “Our engineers were at the spot the whole night. We have apologised to the residents. This will not happen again.”BTM MLAsaid the work was being taken up following orders from the). “The BWSSB had already completed laying pipelines to stop sewage flowing into the drain between KR Puram and Ejipura. The pipeline work fromtowards NGV is almost complete,” he said.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

“Several roads and bridges linking villages to towns and even the national highways have been damaged affecting connectivity. I have directed PWD (Public Works Department) officials to commence restoration works once the rain recedes,” he said.

Further, the CM said he had met officials at the district and taluk levels and instructed them to take all suitable measures to ensure those affected (by the floods) are being aided in a swift and proper manner.

The CM flew from Bengaluru to Hubballi after which he decided to go by road to Uttara Kannada’s Yellapur, Karwar, and Ankola, where he assessed the damages and inspected relief measures taken by various officials.

Detailing on the funds allocated towards the same, he said Rs 48 crore available at present would be used to ensure that people who lost homes are compensated. The CM added that another Rs 100 crore from NDRF funds would also be spent accordingly.

Meanwhile, Bommai directed the district administration to shift those in Kalache village in Yellapur taluk of Uttara Kannada to a safer place. The area had reported widespread devastation due to landslips earlier.

The CM told officials and elected representatives in a review meeting that the residents of the village had apprised them that they were not in a position to continue living in the area. “The residents have consented to relocate to a safer place. From what I have understood, spending more on relief works taken up there would be a waste. A proposal should be submitted after identifying 10-15 acres of land that suits the purpose,” he said.

According to officials, as many as 283 houses in the village have been damaged after heavy rains and landslides stuck on July 22 and 23. The village has a population of 993. “With several more houses on the verge of collapse, it is ideal that they are shifted to a safer location,” an official clarified.

At the same time, responding to a query raised by reporters, Bommai announced that 3000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines each were already allocated for the benefit of the fishermen in Karwar, Bhatkal, and Kumta.

Earlier, on his way to visit the affected areas, Bommai took a pause at the Yellapur Taluk Hospital where he inspected the Covid-19 vaccination centre. The CM also met doctors, nurses, and other health professionals on duty at the hospital and instructed them to ensure good care and treatment to patients admitted there and those seeking outpatient aid.

This month, the tussle between low-pressure areas over the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea meant bouts of heavy rains across coastal and southern districts of Karnataka, including the state capital Bengaluru. So far, the northeast monsoon rains have claimed at least 24 lives while damaging over 9000 houses across Karnataka.

The garden city Bengaluru faced a situation similar to the flooding episode in Chennai two weeks ago. Between November 1 and November 23, the state capital recorded nearly 300 mm rainfall, making it the city's wettest November in recent history.

In the post-monsoon season, from October 1 to November 23, Bengaluru Urban has registered 562 mm rainfall, nearly triple the norm of 190 mm during this time of the year.

As the city is likely to continue receiving light to moderate showers for the next 48 hours, here's a quick look back at the flooding episode that occurred over the weekend, especially on Sunday night. Several parts of North Bengaluru remained inundated on Monday, and the water from the lakes in Yelahanka and Mahadevapura overflowed and entered houses in low-lying areas.

Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), a leading multi-disciplinary research institute located in Jakkur, North Bengaluru, also bore the brunt of the heavy rains. The inundated sewage water destroyed critical research equipment worth several lakhs. Moreover, 25-year-old genetic samples were also reportedly damaged due to the downpour.

Advertisement The campus of Manyata Tech Park— one of Bengaluru's most prominent IT hubs — resembled a grid of canals after being immensely waterlogged. On Tuesday, Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai visited one of the heavily damaged apartments in North Bengaluru to assess the gravity of the situation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also called the CM to express grief over the loss of lives and crop damages.

Here are some glimpses of the floods that brought the city to a standstill:

The MLA demanded that his constituency in Chikkamagaluru district should be considered for relief funds as per the norms of the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).

“I wouldn’t like to specify why other (constituencies) got funds this time. But if Shivamogga city (represented by senior BJP minister K S Eshwarappa) comes under NDRF, why isn’t Mudigere, that received 900 mm rainfall, not brought under the same?” he questioned.

Further, speaking to reporters as he sat in front of the Mahatma Gandhi statue in Vidhana Soudha, Kumaraswamy highlighted that his constituency was “neglected repeatedly”. He explained, “It took us 15 days to recover the bodies of the deceased after facing severe floods in 2019 when six people were washed away. The people had then lost homes and coffee estates, but got no relief as we were neglected. We did not raise many alarms then but this has repeated after the floods again last year and this time.”

Meanwhile, Kumaraswamy added, “Despite our own party being in power, there is neglect. The situation was better when (H D) Kumaraswamy (of the JDS) was the CM in the first year after I was elected (in 2018). Addressing my request, he had allocated grants then.”

The MLA was seen with a placard demanding CM Bommai to release NDRF and SDRF funds for Mudigere and to compensate those who lost homes, land and crops in his constituency.

However, the legislator could not meet Bommai as the CM was on a visit to Udupi on Thursday. “Revenue Minister R Ashoka met Kumaraswamy after which he promised the Mudigere MLA to ensure that the issue would be addressed and brought to the notice of the CM,” sources in the party told The Indian Express.

The saga continues this year – 70 houses were flooded on June 4, and more on July 5. For hundreds of low-income families in Bengaluru, heavy rainfall in the last few years have meant intense damage or even losing their home. Flooding can also lead to the inflow of sewage into slums, which further increases the risk of water-borne and vector-borne diseases.

Flooded roads and underpasses don’t just choke traffic for hours, but they also increase the likelihood of accidents. Flooding has also been leading to damage to public infrastructure like stormwater drains.

Do more of these incidents mean Bengaluru is seeing more intense rainfalls? Or is flooding only due to high levels of concretisation in the city, clogged drains, and so on?

The study ‘Climate change scenario in Karnataka: A detailed parametric assessment’ by the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) in June 2020 shows that Bengaluru’s rainfall patterns have indeed been changing and that it is an indicator of climate change.

Increased annual rainfall, varying patterns

The study looked at rainfall data from two periods – 1960-1990 (named P1), and 1991-2017 (P2). It was found that the average annual rainfall in Bengaluru Urban district increased by 13% (or 107 mm – from 836 mm to 943 mm) in the period from P1 to P2.

In Bengaluru Urban district (bottom right), annual average rainfall increased by 13% in P2. Image credit: KSNDMC

Across the state, the number of ‘light rainfall’ and ‘very light rainfall’ events also increased in the P2 period. The number of ‘heavy-rainfall days’ did not significantly increase. In Bengaluru, only around one heavy-rainfall day had increased over P2, compared to P1. But what was of concern was that, across the state, the quantity of rain pouring down during these days was much higher compared to earlier. And this was leading to devastating effects like floods.

The intensity of the rainfall has increased in Bengaluru too. With decreasing open space and ineffective stormwater drains, there is little recharge – most of the water is lost as runoff. So flooding has become quite common.

The study also found that Bengaluru Urban was one of the districts that showed high variability in the amount of rainfall across years. An analysis of annual rainfall between 1989 and 2018 showed a ‘co-efficient of variability’ of 25%. That is, in 25% of these years, the amount of rainfall varied; it was either above or below normal. The highest variability was in the month of July – in 62% of the years, the rainfall in July had varied from normal.

The study also showed that the number of years with dry spells increased during the P2 period. Dry spells are three or more consecutive weeks with less than 50% of normal rainfall. In large parts of Bengaluru Urban, in P2, there were 3-4 more years with dry spells during southwest monsoon. Dry spells affect factors like soil moisture and groundwater levels.

In an interview with this reporter, Dr G S Srinivasa Reddy, former KSNDMC Director who also headed the study, explains the implications for Bengaluru. Dr Srinivasa, a hydrologist, was with KSNDMC for about 30 years. After his retirement last year, he continues to work as a Senior Consultant at the Centre.

Edited excerpts from the interview:

The study shows increasing amounts of rainfall, as well as annual variability of rainfall in Bengaluru.

As per the report, not only Bengaluru, many parts of South Interior Karnataka is showing an increasing trend in rainfall. At the same time, in North Interior Karnataka, the majority of taluks are showing a decreasing trend.

Second thing is, distribution of rainfall has also changed; the frequency of extreme events has been increasing gradually. And there is greater variability in rainfall in Bengaluru over the years.

With urbanisation, the radiation of excess heat in the city contributes to the development of clouds. Pollutants also act as nucleus for the development of droplets of rainfall.

Is there a difference in intensity of rainfall in the city?

Earlier, data from the IMD (India Meteorological Department) observatory on Palace Road, was taken as Bengaluru’s rainfall. In the last three years, we have established about 100 rain gauges across Bengaluru. This network shows that even within the city, rainfall patterns vary; it’s not uniformly distributed across the city. We have been monitoring data since 2013 – if you see these eight years’ data, you will see variability.

Read more: Did Bengaluru really get excess rains in 2020?

Especially the data we have picked up over the last 3-4 years shows that the total number of ‘heavy-rainfall days’ is less, but the amount of rainfall that occurs is not just ‘heavy’, it’s ‘very heavy’. For example, in one station in south Bengaluru, probably in August 2016, 184 mm rainfall was recorded within 24 hours. But the same day, Yelahanka in north Bengaluru got only 8 mm rainfall. So much variability is happening within the city. We also observed that the western part of Bengaluru, especially Kengeri, generally gets more rain.

Is it normal for one area to have so much rainfall and a nearby area to have so little of it? Is that an indication of climate change?

Variability is common, but a variation of 184 mm and 8mm within a short distance of 20 km is huge. These are all gradual impacts of climate change. Even temperatures in the city have been increasing.

We are seeing this not only in Bengaluru, but in the entire state. From 2018 onwards, we have been observing high-intensity rainfall continuously.

If you consider rainfall in Malnad this year, the total amount of rainfall is not much, but there was heavy rainfall within a few days. There were 1-2 heavy rainfall events each in June and July. Suppose 1000 mm of rain is spread over a month, we may not get much runoff. But if it comes within 4-5 days, it creates a lot of runoff.

In Bengaluru also, we have observed that the runoff coefficient has increased. It depends on the land use pattern. Before the 1980s, only 30-40% of the rainfall used to go as runoff. There were more open areas where water infiltrated into the ground and recharged groundwater. But now it’s 85-90% because of urbanisation, as open areas got converted into concrete jungles, and the carrying capacity of stormwater drains reduced due to encroachments/solid waste disposal. So flooding is quite common in urban areas due to the high runoff coefficient, and also the increased intensity of rainfall.

As per the study, Bengaluru doesn’t show much of increase in the number of heavy-rainfall days though.

Yes, in the study we only looked at the number of heavy-rainfall days. That has not increased. But the amount of rain that falls during these days is much higher now. The intensity would be higher in some parts of the city.

Also for Bengaluru Urban district, the study shows more years with dry spells. Is that a concern?

Yes, there are more dry spells, and it’s not good. Extreme events with either more rainfall or less, are the result of climate change.

Bengaluru mainly gets water from Cauvery river. Even the State’s recent water policy indicates that drinking water gets priority. Dam water in Kabini or KRS will definitely be reserved for drinking water in Bengaluru, even as those areas face some drought. Besides, the main catchment for Cauvery water is Kodagu and part of Wayanad (in Kerala), and rainfall has been decreasing in both these districts. In the future, this may affect the inflow coming to Cauvery.

Climate change impacts not only Cauvery, but also groundwater in many parts of Bengaluru which is the drinking water source for many. Already we see that during summer, many borewells are going dry or yielding very little.

What should ideally be the policy decisions from this report? What’s the way forward?

Whatever extreme events are coming, we have to use it as a resource, especially in urban scenarios. For that, we need to implement rainwater harvesting extensively and very systematically, not just for namesake. We get 55-60 days of rain in Bengaluru, spread across 4-5 months. We have to look at how surfaces like pavements can also be used for groundwater recharge. This would help capture floodwater and also help deal with water scarcity during dry spells.

We have to desilt lakes and make sure sewage doesn’t enter them, and then use lake water for purposes other than drinking. Instead of secondary treatment of wastewater, there should be tertiary treatment, and this treated water can also be used for purposes other than drinking. There is definitely scope to use treated water for domestic purposes, by supplying it through dual piping systems.

Recently BBMP started giving AMC (Annual Maintenance Contract) for stormwater drains, which is a good measure to prevent flooding. Under the 15th Finance Commission, the Centre has allotted Rs 50 cr for Bengaluru, among 6-7 cities, for flood mitigation. The Centre is now bringing out the final guidelines on how to use the funds.

Of course, there should be larger plans to deal with climate change as well.

Does this year’s rain show any specific pattern?

It follows the same pattern that we have discussed so far. Rainfall was concentrated in one or two events, with heavy rain and flooding from these events. Otherwise, there has not been much rainfall this year.

It is worrisome; sometimes these mini floods have levelled up to the first floor in certain homes. Will the authorities concerned take any measures to alleviate the problems of the residents of Koramangala?Manohar John, a resident of, in 1st Block, tells Bangalore Mirror, “On Sunday the whole area was flooded after rainfall. This is not a small problem that will persist for one or two days, once in a. This flooding problem has persisted for over 10 years and now the problem has escalated. The stormwater drain has been diverted and been sort of blocked, as it is very narrow now. When it rains, water from everywhere comes to this site, instead of entering the stormwater drain. All the water ends up coming into our homes. Our fridge, washing machine, cupboard, clothes... Everything gets soaked in rainwater and gets ruined.”John points out that the stormwater drainage connection had been diverted due to aorder to keep the lakes clean and free from drain water.

Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai approved a proposal by the BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) to build concrete retaining walls around 88.5 km of stormwater drains (SWD) in the city. The project, costing Rs 962 crore, or as much as Rs 10.86 crore per km, is expected to free 58 low-lying areas from flood vulnerability.

However, ecologists countered that concretisation would lead to fast surface runoff and also hinder the percolation of water into the ground, leading to flooding. The need of the hour is a more integrated and holistic approach to water management, they said.

BBMP claimed it had already built concrete walls around 312 km of SWDs at the cost of Rs 2,169 crore over the last five years. Bommai asked the BBMP to also prepare a DPR (Detailed Project Report) to widen the drains and build diversion channels to prevent flooding.

Flooding after heavy rains

On Monday, Yelahanka zone recorded 130 mm of rain that led to massive flooding of residential complexes and academic institutions. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) carried out relief and rescue operations. On Sunday also, Yelahanka zone had received the highest rainfall of 153 mm, followed by Horamavu in Mahadevapura zone (103 mm). IMD (India Meteorological Department) has recorded 1,480.2 mm of rainfall in the city this year.

Heavy rain and flooding indicate unauthorised constructions on the city’s valleys and lake beds. Yelahanka lake, Singapura lake, Allasandra lake and Amanikere lake overflowed, flooding houses. Rains flooded some roads in North Bengaluru on Tuesday evening as well. Municipal authorities have failed to clear encroachments in lake land which would have eased flooding. A BBMP report six months ago revealed that over 941 acres of lake land was encroached.

Civil Engineers protest faulty construction

On Thursday, the ACCE (Association of Consulting Civil Engineers), Bangalore centre, organised a walkathon to Freedom Park, to highlight safe construction practices and the need for strengthening bylaws and regulating the profession.

Spokespersons said that the recent building collapses in Bengaluru were due to the failure to consult civil engineers during construction and the lack of geotechnical investigations. They demanded that provisions of the National Building Code (NBC), 2016, be incorporated into local building bylaws.

Anti-Corruption Bureau exposes BDA scams

The ACB (Anti Corruption Bureau) unearthed a number of scams through its raids on BDA (Bangalore Development Authority) offices, including the sale of corner sites and crediting compensation to the ineligible.

Corner sites that must be auctioned according to government rules were sold to private parties through forged documents. In Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout, compensation for land acquisition was credited to persons not related to the land. Massive irregularities have led to losses of over Rs 200 crore to the State exchequer, ACB officials said.

Although the rise is not significant, the rainfall this year has not been uniform with some months recording more than average rainfall. Even in the month of October, the city is receiving heavy rainfall, presumably more than other years.

The wet spells are also leading to a few pockets in the city to go under water, with at least one rain-related death being reported in the city. Here’s why Bengaluru has been receiving heavy rainfall.

Why is Bengaluru receiving heavy rainfall in October?

An official at the IMD told The Indian Express that the trough between cyclones over Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea have resulted in the heavy downpour in October. “The trough is passing through North interior Karnataka. The low pressure developing in the Bay of Bengal is also contributing to this. In the next 48 hours, Bengaluru will receive thunderstorms. Every year during the month of October and November we witness a similar situation.”

The IMD has already recorded 1,006 mm of rainfall against an annual average of 986.9 mm.

According to the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) the state receives an annual normal rainfall of 1,153 mm out of which the Pre-Monsoon season contributes about 10 per cent, the South-West Monsoon season contributes about 74 per cent and the North-East Monsoon season contributes to about 16 per cent. During 2020, the state had recorded 1,301 mm rainfall.

What difficulties did passengers at the airport face?

A weatherman at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said since the launch of the observatory at the international airport in 2011, the highest rainfall was recorded on October 11. Bengaluru airport, which received 178.3 mm of rain on Monday, has now come to a standstill as areas near the pick-up and drop points are flooded. As many as 11 departing flights were delayed due to weather conditions. The waterlogging at the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) junction pressed airport authorities to redirect traffic.

Some passengers shot videos of taking tractors to embark on their journey to the airport and navigating with great difficulty at the airport which turned into a cesspool. A passenger from Bengaluru to Guwahati, Vivek Gupta, said he almost missed his flight due to the mayhem owing to the rain.

“A car turned upside down and the streets looked like swimming pools. My luggage was completely wet in the rain. I had never witnessed such a scene at the airport ever,” he added.

While questions were raised over the drainage system at the airport, the Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) spokesperson commented that since its start of operations in 2008, the airport has not seen such unprecedented rain on a single day. BIAL denied any fault with the design of drainage structures.

A very heavy downpour of unprecedented rain on the evening of October 11, 2021 caused waterlogging in parts of the Kerb side of Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru.

“Although the drainage system in the Kerb area is working well, the sudden high intensity rain caused waterlogging for a short duration. Our team was immediately pressed into action and the issue has been resolved. There was waterlogging at one of the junctions and our traffic staff were present to redirect traffic,” the spokesperson added.

BIAL also claimed that in order to avoid wastage of water within its premises, drains were built to direct excess water flow to Bettakote lake adjacent to the airport.

What do the past records of rainfall in October say?

According to the IMD, every year during the month of October and November, Bengaluru receives heavy rainfall. Data shows that in October 2005, Bengaluru received 605.6 mm of rainfall. On October 6, 2017, Bengaluru witnessed 76.6 mm of rainfall in 24 hours and 385.7 mm of rainfall for the entire month, leading to massive flooding of low-lying areas.

The heaviest rainfall in 24 hours was 178.9 mm on October 1, 1997. On May 06, 1909, the city received 153.9 mm rainfall. The monthly average rainfall in the months of October have been — 204.3 mm in October 2020. October 2019 saw 178.4 mm rain, 111.7 mm rain was recorded in October 2018 and 343.8 mm of rainfall in October 2014.

Is increasing concretisation in the city leading to flooding?

With the threat of heavy rainfall and flooding looming over the state, the municipal agency, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, has identified 209 areas prone to flooding out of which 153 were sensitive and 53 were extremely sensitive. Parts of Bengaluru like J P Nagar, Puttenahalli, BTM, Koramangala and Ejipura, which fall in the low-lying areas, witness flooding.

However, experts have pointed out that the BBMP did not take action on the reports.

Scientist at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Dr T V Ramachandra had reiterated that a poor drainage system, clogged drains with solid waste and building demolition wastes, encroached drains, unscientific remodelling, which includes narrowing and concretisation of drains, loss of interconnectivity among lakes (with poor drainage network — encroachment of drains) and encroachment of buffer zones (lakes, drains) are the major reasons behind flooding of the city.

Sharing his expertise, Ramchandra said that the storm-water drain connecting Bellandur Lake from city market has narrowed to 28.5 m against the original width of 60 m, thereby, violating NGT guidelines of maintaining the physical integrity of SWDs and buffer zones.

“The concretization and narrowing of the drains have only enhanced the flooding in the city. Moreover, this affects the hydrological functional ability of the storm. If the drains are concretized, the velocity of water increases which further enhances the chance of flooding in the area. As the paved area increases – for example, due to vegetation clearing, new housing or industrial developments, urban infill, paving driveways, patios, new roads etc, so does the amount of runoff,” the study says.

Why do some parts of Bengaluru receive heavy rains and others less?

The primary rainy season is from June to October when Bengaluru receives rain from the South-West Monsoon. In this period, the city is vulnerable to floods. KSNDMC looked at the rainfall pattern of Bengaluru between two periods – 1960-1990 (named P1), and 1991-2017 (P2). The study revealed that the average annual rainfall in the Bengaluru Urban district has increased by 107 mm – from 836 mm to 943 mm in the period.

Officials at IMD say that due to increased urbanisation, the radiation of excess heat in the city contributes to the development of clouds. Pollution also contributes to the variation of rainfall patterns in the city. Even the temperature in the city varies. South and East Bengaluru have large pockets of industries, IT companies and residential houses which results in high temperatures.

The immediate effect was the inundation of residential properties and roads.

The flooding triggered by the short, but heavy, spell of rain has been attributed to the large-scale construction activity in the Hebbal valley region which has disrupted the natural flow of rain water from lakes in the upper regions of north Bengaluru, like Yelahanka lake, to lakes in the lower regions, including Rachenahalli lake. Experts have identified constructions that have come up on the lake beds over the years as the single major cause behind the flooding of north Bengaluru after the downpour of November 21.

Spread across approximately 104 acres, the Rachenahalli lake is located in Thanisandra, north of Bengaluru, within the Yellamallappa Chetty lake series in the Hebbal valley. The Jakkur lake and the Sampigehalli lake are some of the lakes upstream to Rachenahalli lake, while the Nagavara and Kalkere are downstream.

Lakes of Bengaluru: | Rapid city expansion choking Kachanayakanahalli lake

In the past few years, several residential premises and academic institutions have come up on the lake bed while the civic agencies looked on as mute spectators. In violation of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order on maintaining a 75-metre buffer zone around the lake, some of these new buildings have come up within 30 metres of the lake. The inlets going into the lake carry a mixture of sewage and stormwater.

A 2003 study on ‘Economic valuation of wetlands’, conducted by Dr TV Ramachandra, R Rajinikanth and VG Rajini of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), reveals that the tank had heavily supported agricultural activities and helped in the maintenance of livestock in the surrounding villages till the year 2000.

During his tenure as executive director of Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Rural Energy and Development (MGIRED), former Indian Forest Service officer Punati Sridhar involved locals as part of efforts to safeguard the lake. “In 2015, it was not even a place where people could walk around. I involved local citizens who showed interest in restoring the sanctity of the lake. Construction labourers who lived close by in huts used to defecate near the lake, so I asked the contractors to provide them with toilet facilities. Along with local citizens, I used to do weekly cleaning of the lake by removing trash. We requested the BBMP to provide watchmen,” he said.

Inspired by the civic action of the non-profit Jalaposhan, Dr Shobha Ananda Reddy who was working as the additional director of MGIRED, took up efforts towards reviving Rachenahalli lake in 2015 and worked closely with Sridhar. With the support of MGIRED staff and students, cleaning of the bund area was taken up. A volunteer citizen group of eight active members was formed for managing the lake, which started to work with the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and local MLA Krishna Byre Gowda. Jalmitra, an NGO, was founded with seven trustees that year with a mission to restore the lake. In 2016, the lake’s custody was transferred from the Bangalore Development Authority to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).

Lake conservationists point out that permissions granted by the civic authorities for constructions on the lake bed was among the reasons that led to the flooding of residential premises and academic institutions, like the premier Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), during the recent rains.

The inlets going into the lake carry a mixture of sewage and stormwater. The inlets going into the lake carry a mixture of sewage and stormwater.

In 2003, ignoring protests by the Lake Development Authority (LDA), the Revenue Department allotted 18.39 acres of Rachenahalli Lake to JNCASR. The MGIRED was allotted 9.88 acres (four hectares). On its part, the BDA too encroached 18 acres of land around the lake by building residential complexes and part of the land was also taken over by a private builder.

According to Dr Reddy, the chief issues plaguing the water body are incomplete underground drainage, blocked manholes and reduced width of the stormwater drains (SWD) that bring water to it. “The SWD is not desilted regularly and parts of the SWD downstream of Rachenahalli lake have been encroached. The approach to rejuvenation of lakes must change. The focus should be on reviving the upstream lakes first and then gradually covering all lakes in the valley. Unfortunately, due to various factors, the government takes up individual lake projects which later get affected by the pollution upstream and excess water flow,” she said.

A senior official in the Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board told The Indian Express that a 10 MLD sewage treatment plant (STP) has been proposed for Rachenahalli lake. “Funds have been allocated for setting up the STP. Work is under progress,” he said.

A 60-feet road in Bellandur’sis unmotorable during the rainy season, due to the encroachment of a storm water drain. After concerned residents pressured the district administration, officials have promised to take care of the problem — private developers building villas on the encroached land. Until then many residents remain locked in their homes as the road is flooded with rainwater up till their knees.A graveyard in this locality also gets submerged under water post rain. The rainwater, flowing from Halanayakanahalli Lake, floods the entire neighbourhood, including, as the drains connected toare blocked by a number of expensive villas., a resident of Halanayakanahalli, said that around 70 villas occupy the land on the rajakaluve. He said that the Bengaluru District Administration (BDA) had tried to clear the encroachments in 2014; bulldozers and policemen had arrived at the spot, but the builders’ political influence squashed the administration’s plans.On Sunday,(AAP) held a protest to demand relief for the locals. “Children are unable to play outside. One has to walk or drive through two to three-feet of water to access the main road.

The terrain of Bengaluru with its gentle hills and valleys provides a natural drainage system with small streams originating from ridges forming major streams that flow into major and minor lakes all around the city.

Over the years, however, hundreds of lakes have disappeared. The main city alone had 272 lakes around 50 years ago but there are only around 168 lakes remaining now. According to a statement made by the Karnataka government in the state legislature two months ago, 1,100 of the 1,500 lakes in Bengaluru and its larger urban and rural districts have been encroached.

The man-made lake that has been in existence for more than 100 years is feeling the pain of rapid urbanisation and expansion of the city into the rural corners on its outskirts. The man-made lake that has been in existence for more than 100 years is feeling the pain of rapid urbanisation and expansion of the city into the rural corners on its outskirts.

One of the consequences of lakes becoming prime real estate and even government agencies taking over lakes to set up bus stands, stadiums, research centres is a sharp decline in groundwater in the city. An Indian Institute of Science (IISc) report says that in localities where lakes existed groundwater was available at depths of 200-300 feet a decade ago compared to the current scenario where borewells have to go to nearly 1,500 feet down to find water in most areas in the city.

Though lakes form a key component of the ecosystem of the city of Bengaluru – including its salubrious weather – only a very few lakes are known publicly. And when they are in danger only the local communities tend to be aware. The Indian Express takes a weekly look at the health and conservation measures that are being taken to protect some of the lesser known lakes in and around Bengaluru.

Kachanayakanahalli lake, Bengaluru Rural district

Two decades ago the fresh water of the 23-acre Kachanayakanahalli lake irrigated paddy fields in the Anekal taluk of rural Bengaluru, around 25 km from the city. Today, the toxic foam and stench emanating from the lake suggest it is being choked to death. The man-made lake that has been in existence for more than 100 years is feeling the pain of rapid urbanisation and expansion of the city into the rural corners on its outskirts.

The lake has not only served irrigation purposes but also helped prevent floods in the region for years.

Of the 23 acres over which the lake is spread, nearly 1.27 acres has been encroached by builders and other private persons. A team of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), which collected the samples from the lake in May this year, reported that sewage streams were now starting to choke the lake.

Parts of the lake – especially its periphery where compound walls have been erected – and the lake bed have become dump yards.

The water quality index of the lake is unsatisfactory.

An environmental officer from the state pollution control board, Asif Khan, said one major reason for the degradation of the Kachanayakanahalli lake is the contamination of the storm water drains (SWD) that bring water into the lake.

“Sewage which enters the Yarandahalli village SWD passes through the township area and joins the Kachanayakanahalli lake directly without any sewage treatment. Hence, this lake is also getting contaminated now,” the environmental officer said.

Local residents and farmers in the area point out that the lake which once acted as a flood regulator now frequently overflows during heavy downpour since the network of stormwater drains has been encroached to build roads and private layouts.

A recent incident of flooding in Anekal sent local residents to the doorstep of local government authorities. When the revenue department checked the status of stormwater drains flowing into the Kachanayakanahalli lake by comparing the existing drains with a 1923 village survey map, it was found that they had shrunken massively.

The drains, which were originally 20 to 30 feet in width, have narrowed down to three or four feet on account of construction of car parking areas, greenhouse sheds and roads.

“The construction of a private layout a decade ago created problems. Kachanayakanahalli lake had a sluice gate. The sluice gate was deliberately closed resulting in the drying up of SWD and the lake. This was followed by another ecological disaster of encroaching the SWD and leaving no buffer zone either around the lake or the drains,” said social activist Captain Santhosh Kumar who is involved in conservation of lakes in the Anekal region.

“The local panchayat does not monitor the entry of sewage into the lake which is a violation of the Water Act of 1974,” he said.

Sources in the Anekal Planning Authority said builders in the region deviated from approved plans for constructions leading to encroachment of storm water drains near the lake.

“Recently, I visited the spot where the reported violations were mentioned and verified the accusations. We found merit in the accusations made by the activists. The drains have indeed been narrowed and no buffer zone has been left around the lake,” the Chairman of the Anekal Planning Authority K Jayanna told The Indian Express.

“A showcause notice was issued to a builder. We intimated the panchayat development officer (PDO) of the gram panchayat. We have asked the Assistant Director of Land Records (ADLR) – Anekal taluk to conduct a survey of storm water drains and buffer zones to ascertain the extent of violations and to submit a report. We will reclaim the drains,” he said.

At least 209 people have died in floods in Maharashtra and 8 still remain missing, it has been confirmed. A total of 4,34,185 people from eight districts have been evacuated to safer places, as rescue operations continue.

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, who is on a tour of visit flood-affected Sangli and Kolhapur districts, directed the authorities on Tuesday to make a list of unauthorised structures on river beds. “No permission can be granted to any structure within the river bed at any cost,” he told the authorities at a meeting held after his visit.

Addressing a press conference, Mr. Pawar said that a committee would be set up under retired principal secretary Eknath Patil. “The committee will study and suggest measures to remove river silt deposits. This would clear the river path and ensure a smooth flow,” he said.

Highway closure

Commenting on the closure of National Highway 4 (Pune-Bangalore) after the road went under water, affecting the supply of milk, fuel and vegetables, Mr Pawar said flood water had accumulated between Shiroli and Kini toll booth. “We will be studying the level of flood water in the years 2005, 2019 and 2021. Based on that, discussions will be held with Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on raising the height of roads,” he said.

Canals to divert water

Meanwhile, former Chief Minister and leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said building canals to divert water to Maharashtra’s drought prone areas was the best option available. “The project was discussed with the World Bank for funding during our time and it had even given in-principle approval. I think this is the only option in the long term.”

The State government on Sunday announced the release of ₹660 crore to take up immediate relief work in the 13 flood-affected districts across Karnataka even as it has sought a central team to assess the damage.

The announcement, by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, came after he chaired a high-level meeting of officials during which the decision was taken. “While ₹510 crore will be released immediately by the State government, we have also decided to utilise ₹150 crore from NDRF funds,” he said.

The State has also written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah to send a team to survey the crop damage and full extent of losses owing to floods. “I will also discuss flood relief with the Centre during my visit to Delhi,” he said. He added that though the rain had stopped in most places, floodwater had to still recede from inundated houses and fields in Belagavi, Uttara Kannada, and Udupi districts. “In all, 466 villages have been affected by the floods, in which 13 persons have died and one person remains missing.”

The Chief Minister said the priority was to restore road and bridge connectivity in the flood-affected region. “The work on restoration of roads and bridges will be taken up after the rains recede. The Deputy Commissioners have ₹700 crore in the accounts that will be used to spend on flood relief,” he added.

Compensation

Saying that officials have been asked to complete the survey of damaged homes and agricultural fields, he said the government has decided to stick to the enhanced compensation for damage to houses that was earlier announced during the regime of his predecessor B.S. Yediyurappa. “Accordingly, we will provide ₹5 lakh compensation to completely damaged houses, ₹3 lakh towards partially damaged houses, and ₹50,000 for houses that have had minor damages. We have released ₹10,000 as immediate relief to the families whose houses have been damaged,” the Chief Minister said.

Mr. Bommai also said that instructions have been given to release money if there is any progress on the construction of houses damaged in the previous floods.

Responding to allegations by Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah that dues from the Centre towards flood relief for 2019 had not come to the State yet, Mr. Bommai said the Union government had already released ₹625 crore. “I can also say what happened during his tenure.

“For the time being (supplies are) still okay, 10 trucks have arrived. Floods have receded in some areas and the victims already went home,” he told Reuters via text message.

128,1206,bangalore,2021,https://www.newsclick.in/revisit-adaptive-strategies-minimise-loss-natural-disasters,30 Nov 2021,Revisit Adaptive Strategies to Minimise Loss From Natural Disasters,"“Forty-four dead, 16 missing after heavy rains in Andhra Pradesh,” is a flash from a news item in one of the channels, Saturday, November 27, 2021. But this is not an isolated incident. In fact, if the year 2021 is taken into consideration, there has been a loss of lives and assets right from the North to South and East to West.

Flooding in Dharamshala, Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh, flooding in Patna, Delhi, Gurgaon, landslides in Uttarakhand and Kullu in Himachal Pradesh, recent flooding in Chennai and Bangalore are all reminders of a continuous challenge that is being faced across the country. Kerala is now having rains for almost nine months a year. Flooding has become a regular feature in this state.

The extreme weather events which used to take place once in a few decades are now happening more frequently. The impact of climate change is more than evident. After US and China, India is at a third position as far as natural disasters vulnerability is concerned.

According to a study undertaken by a research group of the State Bank of India, there were 756 instances of natural disasters that include landslide, storm, earthquake, flood, drought etc, since 1900. From 1900 to 2000, in the 20th century, there were 402 extreme events, whereas from 2000 to 2021 in the 21st century there have been 354 events of natural disasters in India. Still, eight decades to complete the century. One can estimate the massive disasters in the offing for the years to come.

Since 2001, nearly 100 crore people have been impacted and a loss of nearly Rs 13 lakh crore is estimated which is 6% of India’s GDP. From 1900 to 2000, 90,50,599 deaths were reported due to natural disasters in 402 extreme events; from 2000 to 2021 there are 82,747 deaths reported in over 354 extreme weather events. Going by various events, the major loss has occurred due to floods and storms. Floods comprise more than 60% of the total loss in the country.

Interestingly the SBI report, instead of focusing on mitigation and adaptive strategies, relies more on insurance-based models of meeting the challenges of natural disasters. In India nearly 8% of the total losses are covered under insurance, leaving 92 % of the people behind. But insurance cannot be the sole mode of adapting to the impending crisis of natural disasters in the country, especially in the urban centres.

Since it is established that extreme weather events are going to affect the Indian sub-continent more, it is pertinent to revisit the strategies of development. Natural disasters affect people beyond their geographical boundaries. However, urban India where the inequity is pernicious and the people are more vulnerable to living and live in high density, are the worst sufferers.

Unfortunately, the mitigation and adaptive strategies adopted by the government through the National Platform of Disaster Risk Reduction are lacking both in vision and effective implementation.

Urban India which holds nearly 35% of the population has nearly 7% of the total landmass. There is nearly 5,000 statutory and nearly equal number of non-statutory towns. In statutory towns, there is some mode of governance, however poor that may be, but in non-statutory towns, there is a limbo, and no clarity exists as to who will take the responsibility of providing the basic essentials in times of disasters.

The development strategies of city building are too project-oriented and one of the reasons for urban flooding in most of the cities in the recent past has been because of infrastructure development. Especially, the cities that are qualified under the smart city mission of union government are the worst performers.

Why? Because in these cities, apparently in most of the smart cities, the works undertaken are for re-development. There are three components under the smart city mission for infrastructure development called ‘area-based development’(ABD). Pan-city development is done keeping in view the role of artificial intelligence - more on the 'internet of things'.

Under the ABD, as mentioned there are three components: retrofitting, redevelopment and greenfield projects. There is hardly any city that has opted for a greenfield project owing to the large spaces of land required for such a developmental model to be unleashed. Likewise, only a few opted for retrofitting as a priority. Most of the cities have opted for the redevelopment of the city. In this most of the infrastructure projects are unleashed and the natural flow of water is disturbed through these projects.

Take for example two cities: Patna and Bangalore. In Patna under the smart city project construction of flyovers and other infrastructure projects were undertaken. However, the drains that require regular clearance got dumped with muck and the pumps were not functioning at all. The entire drainage system collapsed. Instead of improving the drainage system, the money is spent to build flyovers which further precipitates the problem. This happened despite the fact that the Ganges flowing through the city was at a low ebb.

Likewise, Bangalore, another city on the smart city bandwagon has gone for massive construction projects and have squeezed the natural spaces of lakes. This spelt disaster in the recent rains and some of the areas where these construction activities have taken place were completely inundated.

In such a situation what needs to be done is: disaster mitigation and adaptation plans of the cities must be made integrating the basic ‘master plans’ or as they are called in some cities - ‘development plans’. The mainstreaming of the master plans in tandem with the disaster mitigation and adaptation plans is a must.

Secondly, the clarity of authority in the cities must be specified. This should be clearly mentioned in the disaster plans. There is clarity at the national and state levels, but not at the city level. For example, the National Disaster Management Plan is headed by the prime minister, at the state level SDMA is chaired by the chief minister, but at the city level instead of the mayor of the city, the DDMA i.e., the district disaster management plan of action is ratified and a bureaucrat, in most cases the deputy commissioner takes the call for action. This must change and cities disaster management plans must be steered by the mayor and the council of the city with onus.

Both city development and city governance must be the two core areas to be addressed to ensure that the city and the city residents are best adapted to meet such disasters, which are bound to increase in the future.",issue,2021 Andhra Pradesh floods,"Andhra Pradesh, India","November 25, 2021","November 27, 2021",['Andhra Pradesh'],"['100 mm in 24 hours in Kadapa district', '120 mm in 24 hours in Kurnool district', '150 mm in 24 hours in Anantapur district']","['44 dead', '16 missing', 'Rs 100 crore worth of damage']",,"['Flooding in Dharamshala, Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh', 'Flooding in Patna, Delhi, Gurgaon', 'Landslides in Uttarakhand and Kullu in Himachal Pradesh', 'Recent flooding in Chennai and Bangalore']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The State government on Friday increased the relief amount to be given to families who lost their homes and belongings in the recent floods and torrential rains in 61 taluks in 13 districts.

Instead of ₹3,800 under National Disaster Response Fund/State Disaster Response Fund, the government has decided to release ₹10,000 for each family that has lost its household items and clothes during the recent floods. The government will additionally pay ₹6,200 per household from its own finances.

The amount is to be credited to the bank accounts of eligible beneficiaries by the district administration from its relief fund, stated a Government Order.

Compensation of ₹5 lakh would be provided to owners whose houses have seen more than 75% damage. This is instead of the ₹95,100 under SDRF/NDRF. Similarly, a compensation of ₹5 lakh would be provided to owners whose houses have seen between 25% and 75% damage, but require a rebuild. The relief fixed under NDRF/SDRF is ₹95,100 per house.

Compensation of ₹3 lakh would be given to families whose houses have been heavily damaged, in the range of 25% to 75%, instead of ₹95,100. These are for houses that need to be repaired. Owners of ‘C’ category houses damaged in the range of 15% to 25% would be given a compensation of ₹50,000, instead of the amount of ₹5,200 fixed under SDRF/NDRF.

The amount would be credited to the bank accounts of beneficiaries identified through software developed by Rajiv Gandhi Housing Corporation Ltd.

131,1209,bangalore,2021,https://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/cag-report-stormwater-drains-master-plan-encroachment-70359,2 Dec 2021,50% stormwater drains lost: Bengaluru’s flooding is no surprise,"It takes very little to flood a road or home in Bengaluru. In recent weeks, rains have caused severe flooding in many parts of the city, especially in North Bengaluru. A report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on the city’s stormwater drain (SWD) system, released this September, shows why this shouldn’t be a surprise at all.

In any city, stormwater drains are critical for:

Preventing flood and its related effect

Maintaining clean lakes/water bodies

Groundwater recharge

But Bengaluru’s drainage system has been badly mismanaged by the city corporation BBMP’s Stormwater Drain (SWD) department, finds the audit report. The report covered the years from 2013-14 to 2017-18. It was based on CAG’s audit of records at BBMP and other government agencies, physical inspections of drains, along with an independent study with the technical support of ISRO.

Where have the stormwater drains disappeared?

Bengaluru has a cascading drainage system wherein primary drains (rajakaluves) connect one lake in the city to another. Further, secondary and tertiary/roadside drains channelise rainwater runoff into primary drains. Uninterrupted water flow in the drains and lakes would ensure that excess rainwater doesn’t flood the city. But a large number of drains (and lakes) have simply disappeared.

The auditors’ study, supported by ISRO, showed that the total length of drains in the Koramangala and Vrushabhavati valleys – two of Bengaluru’s four valleys – have nearly halved over the past century.

Cadastral maps of the 1900s show the total length of primary and secondary drains in Koramangala and Vrishabhavathi valleys to be around 113 km and 226 km respectively. But as per the auditors’ study in 2016-17, this had reduced to around 63 km and 112 km respectively.

Valley Drain length in 1900s Drain length in 2016-17 Koramangala 113.2 km 62.8 km Vrushabhavathi 226.3 km 111.7 km

Further scrutiny showed that some drains had been covered and encroached, and in some cases the drains had been remodelled to allow illegal constructions. For example, between 2008 and 2016, the length of two drains that merge before entering Bellandur lake was reduced from 338 m to 136 m. This allowed for constructions, and affected the free flow of stormwater.

The drains entering Bellandur lake were remodelled over the years, with their lengths drastically reducing. Credit: CAG report

Following are Google Earth images published in the CAG report that clearly show how remodelling of the drains caused them to shrink, and facilitated unauthorised constructions around the lake.

Stormwater drains or sewage drains?

Inspections also showed that some drains were not directly connected to lakes; rather their water was channeled into diversion canals built adjacent to the lake as they were carrying sewage. This leads to overflows and flash floods. It also led to many lakes drying up and being converted for other uses. In a response to the auditors in August 2020, the state government admitted that many drains were disconnected from lakes due to the sewage problem.

Read more: Bengaluru lakes are drying up even during monsoons, here’s why

What’s more, Bengaluru has sewage lines that are often laid inside drains, even though the KMC (Karnataka Municipal Corporation) Act and the BWSSB (Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board) Act strictly prohibit this. About 780 million litres (or 54%) of the city’s untreated sewage is discharged into stormwater drains/lakes daily.

Bengaluru doesn’t have records of its stormwater drain system!

Despite the disappearing drains and the crores of rupees spent frequently on drainage works, Bengaluru still doesn’t have a complete map or database of its drainage network.

The city’s stormwater drains are mapped in two documents:

BDA’s Revised Master Plan (RMP) 2015

BBMP’s Master Plan of Drains

BDA’s earlier master plan for the city, the CDP (Comprehensive Development Plan) of 1995, had not marked stormwater drains at all. This did change with RMP 2015, which is the currently valid city master plan. But even as drains were mapped, they were not classified as primary/secondary/tertiary.

BBMP’s SWD master plan was prepared by STUP Consultants in 2010-11 at the cost of Rs 3.6 crore. It did classify drains as primary and secondary, but didn’t map tertiary/roadside drains at all. This is a violation of the NDM (National Disaster Management) guidelines that require a comprehensive database of all drains in cities. Tertiary drains have a critical role in water runoff since they ultimately carry the water into primary/secondary drains.

The audit report raises several questions on the way the SWD master plan was prepared as well:

BBMP claimed that the records of tender conditions and process, payments made to the contractor STUP, etc were lost, and did not submit these to auditors. Hence auditors were not able to confirm if the master plan was prepared correctly and as per tender conditions.

BBMP had detailed volumes of the master plan for only two zones – Yelahanka and Rajarajeshwari Nagar – out of its eight zones; the rest were missing.

The master plan was supposed to include uniform guidelines for the preparation of DPRs (Detailed Project Reports) for drainage works in all zones. So the master plan should have been published first, followed by the DPRs for works on the drains identified in the master plan. But BBMP issued a single tender for both these, and they were prepared simultaneously. So the DPRs were prepared without guidelines, and even as the basic data of drains from the master plan was unavailable. Eventually, many works in the DPRs had to be abandoned when the contractors discovered that not enough land was available around the drains for the works. Abandonment of these works also led to BBMP losing grants of Rs 83.6 crore from the State and Centre under JNNURM, and having to use its own funds to complete the works.

Mismatch between BDA and BBMP master plans

Though the drain network in both documents are supposed to be comprehensive, some drains appear in one document but not the other. For example, a drain connecting Bellandur and Iblur lakes appears in BBMP’s master plan but not in BDA’s RMP. Some others – like an outlet drain from Sankey tank – appear in neither. That is, the city doesn’t have a reliable database or map of all its stormwater drains, which is critical for city planning, points out the audit report.

Read more: BBMP checks no village maps or master plan, while sanctioning plans

Also, neither document maps the buffer zone around drains. All drains should have a buffer zone around them, based on their classification as primary/secondary/tertiary drains. Lack of such mapping leaves drains and their buffer zones to be easily encroached by vested interests or sometimes for the laying of utility lines. During their physical inspections, auditors found that even on the ground, BBMP had not marked the buffer zones, though this is mandated as per the KMC Act.

The government now plans to construct around 90 km of concrete retaining walls for stormwater drains at a cost of Rs 962 crore to prevent areas from getting inundated. Clearly no wall can prevent floods, if we continue to build in valley areas, and don’t fix the drainage networks based on environmental principles.

[In Part 2 of this series, we look at how urban stormwater drains are supposed to be designed, and how they do get designed in Bengaluru.]

Rocky Ridge Cafe











Location :



Rocky Ridge Cafe has two approaches. The straight forward one which goes past the TVS factory in TN and the other through the forest. My recommendation will be to go through the straight forward route onwards, enjoy the nice breakfast and then head back in the scenic route. Most mobile connections do not work there and hence there is a Jio powered hotspot there which the host is willing to share along with a bar code on the walls which once scanned lets you download the scenic route.



This place is a very peaceful once with wonderful hosts serving some amazing breakfast. It's advised to call them before you go there as they prepare by the numbers to avoid wastage. This place has small rustic cottages as well. If I am not wrong, there is a camping zone as well which you can use to pitch your own tents.











This time the ride was with another set of friends with an eclectic set of rides.















We met the team from Risa Astronomy who had hosted a bunch camped overnight to observe the galaxy through a humongous telescope which fills in a car. The pics he showed was mind blowing. This is off season but I sure will catch up in the next season to observe these beauties. They host it in Coorg too in places away from light pollution.











And not to miss, some yummy home made breakfast. The omelettes are amazing there.



Rains have slowed down rides a bit as I am not very comfortable riding in rains giving me some time to update some previous rides. Few rides I have been going back to the same place again and again !! Quick weekends rides.Location : https://g.page/rockyridgecafe?share

Join Date: Nov 2006 Location: Bangalore Posts: 522 Thanked: 1,703 Times One Year - Repsol Edition The bike completes one year and it has not clocked as much yet. It's done just about 5200 km. I ride only over the weekends or some tours. Weekends are going on but tours have been limited. Eyeing Pondicherry and Goa, hopefully soon.



I'll update about the ride and the first service in my next post but in short, it's a fantastic bike that makes me smile every time I hop on.



This post is about celebrating One Year with a new set off clothes. My R3 had the Yamaha Movistar livery (Yamaha YZF-R3 : Detailed Ownership Review) and hence to keep it a no brainer, I chose the Repsol edition livery for the Honda CBR 650R. While browsing I came across this very well done render by a known figure in the automotive industry, Julak Sendie.



https://julaksendiedesign.wordpress....epsol-edition/



Now that the design was in place, it was time to go back to the same brothers, Ashaab and Araash who own WrapCraft in Bangalore to do the magic. Dropped the bike at their place, they sounded quite confident and then started the wait.























They kept sending me pics of the progress but there was one factor we did not expect. Non stop rains. The high humidity and rains did not let them be satisfied with their work as they know they could do better but overall I feel for a handcrafted wrap, they did a pretty good job. They have given a 1 year warranty, as before, for any issues as such. Let's hope nothing dramatic happens. This whole wrap was done on the existing paint, decal and ppf so that I could go back to the stock setup whenever I wished to.



After quite a few days of wait, giving up on the sun to shine through, I finally took the bike and I was quite happy with the final outcome, considering that I gave them just an image to work from. They did their minor modifications to the theme based on what could look good. I was advised to not paint the alloys orange as removing the wrap is not a big deal but removing the orange color from the alloys would be a major drama if I ever decide. Kept it black, for now.



And finally, the complete livery.































It surely stands out now although the Red was a looker too but it was the first year so thought of a new look.

Join Date: Nov 2006 Location: Bangalore Posts: 522 Thanked: 1,703 Times Year One saw continued Covid lock downs, the end of lock downs, things getting back to normal, offices resuming, floods in Bangalore making news and that one thing that kept me in the same relaxed temperament was this bike. Mission Accomplished !!







One year back when I got determined to get back to riding, I was thinking of various meditations online to stay calm and handle the changes one has to face in these recent years, every now and then. Nothing like being inside the helmet for hours listening to the sound of an in-line-4. 5200 kms and still enjoying every km on this.



The Honda CBR 650R is turning out to be a very good choice of bike as a middle weight even though it has a relatively steep price tag. I might have enjoyed the Ninja 1000 SX a well as the other choice. So what's it like after 1 year.



What do I like after a year



The Engine and handling surely tops the list. Extremely smooth. The braking is another thing that I love in this bike. Precise. I also love the way the power bands are distributed and how sane and composed this bike is, making you feel very confident and connected. Typical Japanese bike characteristics. The rider sitting stance is quite decent. Not too committed, nor upright for sure. I have just gone for one short tour of around 1200+ kms, to and fro and it's been quite okay. It's nowhere close to a Goldwing comfort level but it can match up to any good sports tourer. CB vs CBR, if upright stance is not a necessity, I would always recommend the CBR over the CB. It helps quite a bit in higher speeds. This is vouched by a CB owner too who rode my bike. The headlights are good, if not great. Some CBR owners rely on Aux light setups for long tours. Mileage, although not a topic of discussion, has been a surprising 22 km/ltr. Perfect for a weekend ride with a 15 ltr tank. Pillion comfort is quite good in this one if one can handle the posture. The seat is quite wide and comfortable.



What do I not like after a year



It's been a year and about 5200 kms and I am still not very used to the switch controls. I struggle when I do not want to. At this price point, I still wish it had some good riding modes. Quick shifter and an Akra should have been a stock setup. No other issues worth mentioning out there.



Accessories



The ones I recommend



- Evotech Radiator Guard

- Evotech Front Fork Crash Bobbins

- Evotech Engine Guard

- PUIG Shorty Levers (Much more easier to handle compared to the stock long ones)

- PUIG Spools

- PUIG Front mudguard extender

- Honda Quick Shifter

- Akra Exhaust (This is absolutely amazing. Let's you really hear the In-line-4)

- Phone Mount

- Extended USB Charger



The ones which did not make any or much of a difference



- PUIG rear mudguard extender

- PUIG bar-end weights

- Hepco Side Stand Extender (This came off and I do not have it now)

- BMC Stock Air Filter (This could be in the recommend list for peace of mind of just washing one away if it gets dirty but that's more like it)



The ""want"" ones



- PPF on painted surface (This was not needed considering the wrap, but wrap was an after thought)

- Ceramic coating on non painted surface

- Wrap

- Evotech Tail Tidy (This looks good but creates a MESS on rainy days)

- Rear Seat Cowl



I always think, this is the last I am spending on the bike but I end up with something or the other. A good set of tyres is next on the line, when needed. I could go for some sticky ones as the mileage I clock in a year is not too much.



Now for the Services



First Free Service : Rs. 3341/-

Second Free Service : Rs. 3010/- (Did not need chain lubing. Got it done at home)

Third Free Service : Rs. 3695/- (Engine Oil cost has gone up by few hundreds)











There is one service center in Bangalore that is authorized to service a 650R and that's about 52 kms away if I take the good roads around but nothing to complain here. I enjoy the ride to the location and I am happy that at least there is one service center in the city. Service experience has been quite seamless. The most complicated task has probably been cleaning the air filter in regular services and installing an Akra otherwise. The pricing has been quite reasonable. The cost of the Engine oil has gone up by few hundreds, else rest of it is more or less the same. I have completed the free services and it will be interesting to see how it goes from here on.



Before I end, a quick look at the BMC air filter after a year. Dirty and then washed off.













One year completion also calls for the renewal of Insurance and RSA (Road Side Assistance)



When we buy this bike, the insurance available is 5 years Third Party and 1 year comprehensive. Hence, it's recommended to renew comprehensive every year. I had reached out to the Insurance agent linked to the dealer as their association helps but the agent was quite unavailable and what he quoted was an IDV which was a lakh lesser and priced at around 4k more than what ICICI Lombard personals from their call center provided. I still would have preferred the dealer associated one for ease of claims and all but he was just not available and my insurance expiry was fast approaching. So finally I ended up with an IDV of 8.47 Lakhs with a premium of 20,576 INR with ICICI Lombard employees directly. This includes Zero Dep, Return to Invoice and RSA.



Next is RSA from Honda. Road side assistance is another one of those things which you would wish you would not use, but it's good to have it. The revised RSA that includes something called Unlimited RSA is what I opted for which allows towing from anywhere in India, unlimited kms. This costed Rs. 7,999/-. Mentioned below is what you get for Unlimited RSA.



Unlimited RSA



• Minor Mechanical or electrical breakdowns – In case your vehicle suffers a mechanical or electrical breakdown causing sudden

stoppage, suitable support shall be provided on the spot to mobilize the vehicle. This service covers minor adjustments and

I used to love the 7100 for my R3 and I think it's good to continue with it. 300v or something was also there, cant recollect clearly, but that was more recommended if you are hitting the tracks or very hard on riding.

Would also help if you can share where did you source the Ackra Exhaust from and how much vitamin M is needed for it Shorty levers were installed in GGMC (Gear Gear Motorcycle) just under BikenBiker. I bought the shorty levers from BikenBiker store.The mech is right that it could effect the life of the clutch plate but the difference it makes is something I am living with.



Coming to Akra, it goes around the 1.2 Lakhs range in various places that it's available in India. I picked it up and got it installed from Bigwing. ( 3 ) Thanks ) Thanks The following 3 BHPians Thank abhisheksircar for this useful post: irajput, Jesse_Mach, neil.jericho Page 4 of 4 < 1 2 3 4

133,1211,bangalore,2021,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/chennai-floods-climate-crisis-7618776/,12 Nov 2021,We must recognise cities as waterscapes,"Chennai is flooded. The north-east monsoon that has been hovering ominously over Tamil Nadu has brought with it the highest volume of rainfall within 24 hours in the last five years. It has also revived memories of the devastating Chennai floods of 2015, a collective trauma that its residents are yet to outlive.

In the last two decades, floods in South Asia have become urban — erasing the hubris that for long had separated city and country. Floods recur in major cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Dhaka, Karachi and Kathmandu, and accompany high-intensity rainfall events. In October this year, buses have floated down flooded roads in Hyderabad, while in Bengaluru, India’s first “greenfield” international airport got inundated, reclaimed by the water it had hoped to displace and divert with concrete.

In August this year, as monsoon floods raged across the subcontinent, IPCC’s 6th Assessment Report (AR6) was published. The report noted the increasing frequency of heavy precipitation events since the 1950s and inferred that they were being driven by human-induced climate change.

The climate crisis, if there was ever any doubt, is here. It has made extreme rainfall events more severe and unpredictable than ever before. However, it only partially explains the recurrence of urban floods. The complete story lies buried in the politics of land.

All cities in the subcontinent are waterscapes. They are threaded with rivers, speckled with wetlands and springs, and they rest on invisible aquifers. Yet, driven by a thirst for land, our cities are planned to subjugate water, not live with it. It is this land-centrism that undermines urban drainage.

The word drainage is derived from Old English, dreahnian, originally referring to the straining out of a liquid. Urban drainage, if it was to do justice to its etymology, would turn cities into sieves that allowed water to soak and pass through. This required safeguarding the numerous natural watercourses threading the city as they drain water away and sustain fragile groundwater aquifers. These waterways — belittled as natural storm drains or nullahs — have been sacrificed at the altar of land-centric urban growth.

In 2014, Gubbi Labs, a research collective in Bengaluru, established through geospatial imaging that 376 km of natural storm drains — encroached on and paved over — had disappeared from the heart of the Silicon Valley of India.

Advertisement

In 2015, the National Green Tribunal in India formed a committee to report on the status of natural stormwater drains in Delhi. On inspection, out of the 201 “drains” recorded in 1976, 44 were found to be “missing”.

In both cases, these “missing” waterways were either encroached and built over or connected to sewage drains. The apathy for restoring disappearing urban waterways, stands in stark contrast to the Indian government’s recent obsession with reviving ancient rivers.

Poor design and corruption — inseparable bedfellows in South Asian urban planning — significantly contribute to urban floods. Take the design of constructed stormwater drains. The size of their outlets should be based on the intensity of rainfall (mm/per hour) and the peak flow inside the drains. In most South Asian countries, however, either design guidelines are missing, or the outlets are too small to accommodate peak flow. In specific areas of Karachi, for example, stormwater drains from real-estate properties are directed towards main roads. Little surprise then that above-average rainfall produces flooded localities.

Advertisement

Similarly, by violating environmental laws and municipal bye-laws, open spaces, wetlands and floodplains have been mercilessly built over, making cities impermeable and hostile to rainwater. In almost all cities in South Asia, residential properties have been built on stormwater drains. In Karachi, due to such encroachment, the width of drains has been reduced from 200 feet to 20 feet.

Unfortunately, encroachments are always blamed on the urban poor who live precariously in low-lying drainage areas because of inadequate social housing. After the devastating Chennai floods of 2015, experts pointed out that the biggest encroacher of urban waterways and wetlands was actually the state government of Tamil Nadu, which had built runways, bus terminals and IT parks by paving over water bodies.

Ever since concretisation became shorthand for urbanisation, rainfall in a changing climate no longer finds its way towards subterranean capillaries or surface water bodies. Massive quantities of water released during intense short-duration rainfall now get diverted towards drainage networks which are either “missing”, or choked with debris, sewage and solid waste. Whatever water does manage to reach the nearest river finds that the bank has been converted to real estate, and the river bed mined extensively for sand.

The political response to floods has always been to transfer the blame to the skies. Floods were viewed as products of “fickle” monsoons and “unruly” rivers. In response, millions of tons of concrete were and continue to be poured into constructing dams, embankments, culverts, and sea walls. Ironically, as South Asian cities metamorphosed into impervious lumps of concrete, they invited floods closer home.

To heal the hydrophobia that has shaped our urban experience, we need to move away from land-centric urbanisation and recognise cities as waterscapes. We need to let urban rivers breathe by returning them to their floodplains. One restored lake or a reclaimed waterway, though welcome, is no longer adequate. The entire urban watershed needs to heal, and for that to happen, we need less concrete and more democracy and science at the grassroots.

Three bodies were recovered.The power project was swept away completely, added state Director General of Policewhile describing the situation as under control. Homes along the way were also swept away as the waters rushed down the mountainsides in a raging torrent. There were fears of damage in human settlements downstream, including in heavily populated areas. Many villages were evacuated and people taken to safer areas.Connectivity with some border posts was “totally restricted” due to a bridge collapsing near Reni village, an ITBP spokesperson said.Several districts, including Pauri, Tehri, Rudraprayag,and Dehradun, that were likely to be affected were put on high alert and forces of the ITBP and the(NDRF) rushed in to help with the rescue and relief effort.“I am constantly monitoring the unfortunate situation in Uttarakhand.

The rain on Saturday night, the heaviest since 2015, was caused by a low-pressure formation over the Bay of Bengal.

Overnight impact

The heavy rainfall that began on Saturday night and continued till early this morning flooded several neighbourhoods such as Vyasarpadi, T Nagar, Velachery, Adyar, Mylapore, and Royapettah.

Madhavram, Jawaharlal Nehru Nagar, Tondiarpet High Road, Royapuram, Northern Trunk Road, Khader Nawaz Khan Road, Teynampet, the interior parts of Velachery, and stretches of Sholinganallur in the suburbs reported flooding or inundation early this morning.

The Tamil Nadu government said it released 500 cusecs of water from the Puzhal reservoir and alerted residents of low-lying areas on the surplus canal banks. It also released water from the Chembarambakkam reservoir.

Heaviest rain since 2015

Data from Nungambakkam in the city and Meenambakkam in the suburbs suggests that the city and the suburbs received 21.5 cm and 11.3 cm rainfall, respectively, by 8.30 AM.

In one of Chennai’s heaviest rain episodes in 2015, the city recorded rainfall of 24.6 cm in 24 hours on November 15 and 16, breaking a November 2005 record of 14.2 cm.

But the maximum recorded rainfall over a 24-hours period may date to November 1976, when Chennai received 45.2 cm. Another two-day record was registered on November 12 (25 cm) and November 13 (33 cm) 1985.

Northeast monsoon

Chennai is largely reliant on the northeast monsoon, which brings rainfall during October and December. Easterly winds start blowing from mid-October, with the onset between October 10 and 20.

The northeast monsoon is Tamil Nadu’s primary monsoon and brings sufficient rainfall to the state. All other states rely on the southwest monsoon, which usually sets in during May, to July. While the southwest monsoon helps Tamil Nadu maintain groundwater tables after a prolonged summer, the northeast monsoon elevates it.

The northeast monsoon brings 60% of the coastal regions’ annual rainfall, while the interior districts get 40-50%.

Low-pressure system

The India Meteorological Department said a low pressure was likely to form over the Bay of Bengal and move towards the northern Tamil Nadu coast. It has predicted moderate rainfall in the coming days ahead of the system’s formation.

The Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre – Tropical Cyclones said in a bulletin an upper air cyclonic circulation was lying over southeast Bay of Bengal and the adjoining equatorial Indian Ocean region. It is likely to lead to the formation of a low-pressure area over southeast Bay of Bengal around Tuesday.

The system is predicted to become more marked during the subsequent 48 hours and move towards the northern coasts of Tamil, the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre – Tropical Cyclones said.

Heavy rainfall warning has also been issued for Wednesday. A thunderstorm is likely to bring heavy-to-very heavy rainfall at isolated parts of Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Chengalpet, Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Mayiladuthurai, Tiruvarur, Pudukottai, and Thanjavur districts of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal.",flood,Chennai Floods 2022,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",2022-01-08,2022-01-09,"['Vyasarpadi', 'T Nagar', 'Velachery', 'Adyar', 'Mylapore', 'Royapettah', 'Madhavram', 'Jawaharlal Nehru Nagar', 'Tondiarpet High Road', 'Royapuram', 'Northern Trunk Road', 'Khader Nawaz Khan Road', 'Teynampet', 'the interior parts of Velachery', 'stretches of Sholinganallur in the suburbs']","['21.5 cm', '11.3 cm']","['Flooding', 'Inundation']",0,"['Disruption of transportation', 'Damage to property', 'Loss of livelihoods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

According to Koll, one of the greatest challenges in India is we have not assessed the risk of multiple extreme weather events in cities.As much as the Bengaluru context is unique, so are the challenges. Climate risk assessment and action for a city that boasts 200-odd lakes, numerous parks, and a sprawling tree cover and rich biodiversity at an elevation of about 800 m naturally call for deep thought.A rather profound realisation must take root: That the lakes are unique commons that play a critical role in rejuvenating the city is perhaps only a starting point to ‘why Bengaluru is championing climate action and could be a model for other cities,’ in a year or two. This shall help attract businesses of the future as well.Recent extreme weather in New York and New Delhi, and in China and Germany, must send Bengaluru straight to the table.For Bengaluru, the challenge may be largely from the monsoon patterns, said Koll, with long dry periods intermittent with short bursts of heavy downpour.“This leads to drought-like situations and water stress and flash floods. A study on how extreme weather events interact with the land use changes and urban infrastructure is crucial. Bengaluru can be redesigned to save water and, while providing drainage and flood plains for absorbing the water from flash floods. Any kind of development should factor in climate alongside risk assessment and action,” Dr Koll explained.Elsewhere, the Gambia has turned up as the only nation that is on track to tackle the climate emergency, according to Climate Action Tracker ratings.India, alongside other G20 nations, was termed ‘highly insufficient’ in meeting the 1.5-degree Paris accord.Thawing ice in the poles and melting glaciers mean more methane is released into the atmosphere. Record summer temperatures in Siberia, rising sea levels, thereleasing more carbon than it is absorbing, first-time rain on the Greenland ice sheet, all signal urgent action to salvage what is not already lost.“Rain in a place historically defined by bitter cold portends a future that will alter coastlines around the world, and drown entire cities,” wrotein theDelhi and Mumbai scoring poorly in the latest safe cities index when sister cities in Asia - Singapore, Tokyo and Kuala Lumpur - climbing the sustainability ladder in terms of climate and environment is a cue for Indian policy makers to gauge what is really at stake.Raging echo chambers in academia or social media, if not helping robust action and policy translation, must revive efforts to establish a greater connection.The radical is possible: researchers close to resurrecting the mammoth to save the Asian elephant and to introduce a hybrid that could roam the arctic steppe once again or the world’s largest tree, Generalthe giant Sequoia, over a thousand years old, being wrapped up in aluminium foil to save it from climate-triggered wildfires, are no doubt inspiring instances.At the cusp of the transition from a fossil fuel-driven economy to a tech-enabled and climate conscious future, let’s be inclusive.",discussion,Bengaluru Floods,"Bengaluru, India",2022-07-07,2022-07-10,Bengaluru,100 mm,100 crores,0,"Infrastructure damage, displacement of people","{'source': 'The Hindu', 'author': 'Rajmohan Sudhakar', 'url': 'https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/bengaluru-is-staring-at-an-unfathomable-future-in-the-ensuing-climate-emergency/article65500000.ece'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Taking roads into account at least 168 kilometres of urban roads, 138 km of district major roads, and 56 kilometres of state highway were also damaged due to the same. As many as four people were noted to have lost lives at the same time.

Eshwarappa’s statement comes a couple of days after ministers in the state were tasked to review the situation pertaining to floods by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai. The CM had deployed ministers to various districts of the state for review visits, after which a detailed report was sought.

Eshwarappa was accompanied by his new colleague in the Bommai-led cabinet Araga Jnanendra when they visited the affected areas of Theerthahalli — Bharatipura, Edehalli, Yogi Narasipura, Heggarbetta, Geruvalli, and surrounding areas. Even though Jnanendra was made in charge of the Chikkamagaluru district, he accompanied the review visits as he is the jurisdictional (Theerthahalli) MLA.

More than 11,000 people have been displaced in the Brazilian state of Bahia due to flooding, with authorities scrambling Saturday to provide relief to residents without alternate housing.

The heavy rains have killed 17 people since November, including the latest death on Thursday, the state's civil protection agency said.

A total of 4,185 people were seeking shelter, according to data released by the agency on Friday, after the rains struck 19 cities particularly hard, including Guaratinga, Itororo and Coaraci in the state's south.

The agency reported that a total of 11,260 people had been forced to flee their homes.

The Bahia and federal governments mounted a joint operation on Saturday, in collaboration with other states, to mobilize personnel, aircraft and equipment, as well as provide relief to residents in the flooded areas.

""We are fully mobilized, taking all measures to ensure the necessary support to the victims of the heavy rains that hit Bahia this Christmas,"" the state's governor, Rui Costa, said in a video message.

Flooding and traffic blocks were reported on 17 roads, with some caused by landslides and rockslides, the state's infrastructure secretary reported.

December rainfall in Bahia's capital Salvador totaled 250 millimeters (9.8 inches) through Friday, a figure five times the historic average, city officials said.

Engineers of Rajkot Irrigation Projects Circle of the irrigation department said the work on replacing all the floodgates of the dam started in January and is expected to be completed by the end of the next month.

“As per the latest status, 14 floodgates have already been replaced. Our target is to complete the work by end-March,” Shailesh Patel, the executive engineer of (RIPC), said.

Located at Lilakha village in Gondal taluka Rajkot, Bhadar dam has a gross storage capacity of 188.14 million cubic metres (mcm), the second-highest in the Saurashtra region after the Shetrunji dam. “Construction work for this dam started in 1952 and water for irrigation from it was given to farmers for the first time in 1963. The gates were quite old and needed to be replaced. Officials from the Dam Safety Organisation (DSO) had also visited the dam some time ago and it was felt that the gates needed to be replaced,” a source in the irrigation department said.

Each of the 29 floodgates is six-foot high and 35-foot long. “Vertical girders supporting the floodgates had started rusting and weakening.

“An inspection by the Gujarat Engineering Research Institute (GERI), Vadodara, recently had recommended that the gates should be replaced. Dam Safety Organisation of Central Water Commission had also made similar recommendations,” Patel said. The executive engineer added the gates of the dams are being replaced after around 65 years.

The floodgate numbers 11, 14, and 28 were damaged following an unprecedented inflow of water in Bhadar dam due to a flash flood caused by a cloudburst in its catchment area in Amreli district in June 2015. Sill-beams of these gates were damaged as vehicles like tractors, tractor-trollies and large trees crashed into the dam structure after being washed away in the flash flood. The irrigation department had then restored the structure by undertaking some repairing work.

“Rules mandate that fresh coat of paint be applied to the gates every three years. Before a fresh coat is applied, the gates are sandblasted to remove corrosion. For the past few cycles, gates gauge was found to have substantially reduced due to the process of corrosion, warranting their replacement,” another officer added.

Anar Construction Private Limited of Ahmedabad has been awarded the work of replacing the floodgates at a total cost of Rs 1.66 crore. The private firm is forging parts of the floodgates at its factory and assembling them at the dam site after transporting them there. Each gate has three parts, engineers said.

“The wire-ropes of the gates were replaced post the flash flood in 2015 and, therefore, the present contract doesn’t include replacing the wire-ropes,” said an officer.

Flooding was reported in rivers across the state including the Mhadei (Mandovi), Chapora, Dudhsagar, Khandepar and Valvanti. Several villages across five talukas were affected by the flood waters — Sattari and Bicholim in North Goa and Dharbandora in South Goa were the worst-hit.

“Many people had to be evacuated because of the flooding. We have taken the help of the Navy and the port authorities too. We had to rescue some people using rescue boats. Our teams have been working since last night to move people to safety. The (400) evacuated people from the five talukas have been housed in government primary schools and we have made arrangements for their accommodation and food,” Sawant said.

Heavy rains lash Bengaluru: Several areas waterlogged, trees uprooted; CM BS Yediyurappa promises relief 1 9 Waterlogging reported from several areas Incessant rains lashed Bengaluru on Tuesday night, leading to waterlogging in several parts of the city. It not only inundated low-lying areas in the city but also caused huge property loss in the city. Vehicles in the basement of some apartments in the low-lying areas were also submerged. Researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and University of Saskatchewan, Canada, have found that Bengaluru has been witnessing increased precipitation/rainfall over the recent past compared to before. In a study, they found that the city has witnessed about a 67 per cent increase in extreme precipitation over the recent past (1981-2011) compared to the far past (1931-1960). Photo by Kaushik JN/MMCL Study says Bengaluru rainfall has seen an increase in recent years The torrential rains also led to the uprooting of trees. The worst affected areas were Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Vishveshwarapuram, Lakkasandra, Gottigere, Nagarabavi and Kengeri. Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan, along with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad had visited Rajarajeshwari Nagar to take stock of the situation. Photo by Kaushik JN/MMCL Spell of heavy rains spells doom; trees uprooted Rainwater entered around 100 houses and commercial establishments on the 5th Cross and 80 ft Road of Koramangala. The basement of a commercial building on the 80 ft Road was flooded and the owner of the building has engaged labourers to pump out the water. When Bangalore Mirror visited the area, workers were cleaning the ground floor of Dass Suites on the 5th Cross. The apartment complex’s elevator pit is filled with rainwater. Residents said that this happens every year and they are tired of complaining to the BBMP. Photo by Kaushik JN/MMCL Underpass inundated Hundreds of residents of Vijinapura and other areas struggled to reach other areas since the underpass near the Food Corporation of India warehouses got inundated. Many two-wheeler riders and motorists were seen struggling to wade through the water at the underpass. Photo by Kaushik JN/MMCL Sankey Tank overflows Following the downpour, Sankey Tank started overflowing on Wednesday for the first time in the last 12 years. Water was seen gushing out of the waste weir on Wednesday morning. People recalled that the tank had last overflowed in 2008. Sankey Tank was filled to the brim and the rainwater had also inundated the play area in Sankey Park. The city received 75 mm to 150 mm rain on Tuesday night. Photo by Anantha Subramanyam K/MMCL Hagadur’s roads implode after heavy rains Residents of Hagadur ward were used to the slushy mess their roads had become every since the BWSSB dug them up to lay sewage lines, but heavy rain on Tuesday night snatched the ground beneath their feet. The casualties of the road cave-in were a car and a water tanker. A driver whose car got damaged completely told Bangalore Mirror that his neighbours alerted him saying that sand had started sinking in at the spot where he had parked the car. Nearly five hours later, the car was extricated using a JCB, however, it was completely damaged. Another resident said that two-wheelers riders are struggling to take their vehicles to the main road. Residents also said that the condition of the roads has been bad for a few years and the BWSSB had left the work half-way after digging up the roads.

in the city has become seasonal like the rains. The reason is that the illegal constructions along storm water drains are not removed despite annual assurancesOne reason why Bengaluru experiences flooding is because of encroachments on storm water drains. Buildings that are allowed to be constructed around the SWD without following buffer zone norms are a problem. But soon after there’s flooding and there is a hue and cry, elected representatives and engineers from Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike () visit the rain-affected areas and make announcements of removing encroachments on. No sooner than these announcements are made, they vaporize.In August 2016, theembarked on clearing about 240 buildings that had been illegally constructed along the SWDs. But nothing came of it.In 2019, the State Chief Secretary has rapped the BBMP for not clearing 1,741 encroachments along SWDs. The Chief Secretary had asked the BBMP to clear 250 encroachments out of the total 1,741 encroachments every month. However, Palike did not proceed further due to the reasons best known to it. It’s the same story in Yelahanka, Rajarajeshwarai Nagar, Bommanahalli, Mahadevapura, Dasarahalli, Koramangala Valley, and Bengaluru South.Recently, State Revenue Minister R Ashoka spoke of clearing encroachments along SWDs with immediate effect but went soft on the very next day. The Revenue Minister attributed legal problems as the main hindrance for the BBMP authorities to clear the encroachments.Meanwhile, social activists say the BBMP and elected representatives remember SWDs only when they visit rain-affected areas in the monsoon. “Most of the retention walls of the storm drains are not constructed scientifically. There is no coordination between the BBMP and the. For example, a UGD drainage pipeline is being constructed in the storm water drain near Srinagar in the city. This is not allowed. Most of the revenue layouts are developed by the staunch followers of prominent politicians. How do you expect the BBMP to act against such people with political clout,’’ asks Parisara Chandrasekhar, an environmental activist.Sai Datta, a social activist who filed a complaint with Lokayukta against the encroachment of storm water drains, said the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had ordered theto file a criminal case with the Bengaluru Metropolitan Task Force (BMTF) against the BBMP engineers negligent towards the encroachment of the storm water drains. “But thefiled a `B’ report in the storm water drains encroachment case. No action was taken against the engineer responsible for illegal constructions. I want the BBMP to publish a white paper on the maintenance of the storm water drains,’’ said Sai Datta.Ramprasad, co-founder of, said that compensation for those people whose homes are demolished for encroachment, should be paid from the money recovered from the BBMP engineers, revenue officers and tahsildars responsible for allowing encroachment.Gagan Gurudatta, Managing Trustee of Sai Temple, Dattatreya Layout, Hosakerehalli said that the ongoing BWSSB work in the SWD in Hosakerehalli was the reason for the flooding of the area recently. “One side of the SWD has no wall at all. The other reason is because the width of the SWD was reduced while widening the Ittamadu and Dattatreya Layout road,’’ he said.Meanwhile, BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said that the BBMP’s legal cell would submit a request to the court seeking permission to demolish the buildings constructed on the storm water drains. “There was no buffer zone concept before 2007. All these buildings were constructed encroaching the SWD much before 2007. The BBMP engineers have not given permission for the buildings constructed in the buffer zone. If any engineer found responsible for such illegal constructions, severe action will be taken against him,’’ said the BBMP Commissioner.* 2016 Flooding in various parts of city, boats to be pressed into service in Kodichikkanahalli* Sept 2017 Flooding in Thanisandra, Vidyaranyapura, Yeshvantpur and Uttarahalli in September 2017.* Sept 2018 Drains overflowed, homes flooded in Gottigere, Hosakerehalli* Oct 2019 Many homes flooded when Doddabidarakallu Lake bund breached* Nov 2019 250 houses were flooded when Hulimavu lake bund breached.* Sept 2020 HBR Layout, Horamavu, Sahakara Nagar floodedn Oct 2020 Hosakerehalli, Dattatreya Layout, Hosakerehalli, HSR Layout, Kumaraswamy Layout flooded",flood,Bengaluru Floods 2020,"Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",2020-10-13,2020-10-14,"['Hosakerehalli', 'Dattatreya Layout, Hosakerehalli', 'HSR Layout', 'Kumaraswamy Layout']",['75 mm to 150 mm'],"['Vehicles in the basement of some apartments in the low-lying areas were also submerged.', 'The basement of the marriage hall, at Meenakshi Kalyana Mantapa in RR Nagar that had been converted into the dining area was filled with rainwater from the stormwater drain, driving the guests to despair.', 'Rainwater entered around 100 houses and commercial establishments on the 5th Cross and 80 ft Road of Koramangala.', 'The worst affected areas were Rajarajeshwari Nagar, Vishveshwarapuram, Lakkasandra, Gottigere, Nagarabavi and Kengeri.']",0,"['CM Yediyurappa conducts aerial survey in the rain-ravaged districts of Ballari, Raichur, Kalaburagi and Bidar, and said that a team of officials comprising from the State and the Centre will do a joint survey to assess the losses caused by the rains.', 'According to him, at least 43,000 people in 14 taluks are affected by rains.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Untitled Carousel Bengaluru: No earthquake hit the city, confirms KSNDMC; officials trying to ascertain source of a mysterious noise A mysterious loud noise from different parts of Bengaluru on Wednesday afternoon left the residents panicked.

Netizens went into a complete frenzy on Wednesday moments after an unusual and mysterious sound was heard in different parts of Bengaluru city.Social media users anxiously speculated whether it was an earthquake or an explosion. Fortunately, it was neither, as confirmed by officials.However, soon after the initial panic passed, Bengalureans flooded the social media platforms with plenty of memes and jokes which also led to #Bangalore,sound and Bangalore boom dominating the trends on Twitter.While some of them blamed it on an alien invasion, TikTok's ratings dropping also made it to the meme-fest.Indian cricketer Virat Kohli’s dinosaur act also makes it to the listAnd when you can't explain it, there must be a Rajnikanth twistCheck some of the other memes here:",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe flood

With the monsoon reactivated in the area, the landslide managed to burry an entire house. The intermittent rainfall also made the rescue work hard. Meanwhile,was also flooded due to the overflowingand its tributaries., which had seen low rainfall this season, also saw heavy rains in the past few days. The sudden increase in the rainfall in the past few days prompted the India Meteorological Department (Met) to issue a red alert.With heavy rains, the reservoirs are filling up dangerously fast. The inflow into the Harangi reservoir increased to 11,811 cusecs. Meanwhile, the KRS reservoir near Mandya has had a steady increase in the inflow with 43,667 cusecs and the reservoir has reached 111.80 feet (full reservoir level-124 feet). Additionally, due to the discharge of water from Kabini, many low lying areas around Nanjangud were submerged.In Malnad region, too, heavy rain is being reported. The Lingamakki reservoir, one of major hydel stations for the state, has received 84,806 cusecs of water entering the dam which now stands at 1,782 feet, closing in on the Full Reservoir Level (FRL) of 1,819 feet.With heavy rainfall in Maharashtra, the inflow at Hipparagi barrage was at 84,806 cusecs of water. The monsoon which was lull till recently (the state reservoirs had around 47 per cent of the total capacity of water till July 31) has picked up vigorously with many areas in the state now facingLast year too, it was during the first week of August when monsoon gained momentum in the state, filling up most of the reservoirs, and causing flooding in many districts.BS Yediyurappa, who is recuperating in a private hospital, has directed the ministers to visit the flood-prone areas and join the rescue works. Revenue Minister R Ashoka said he has conducted video conference meetings with deputy commissioners of 19 districts to take stock of the situation.He also said that a red alert has been issued in Udupi, Uttara Kannada, Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu, Shivamogga, Chikkamagaluru and Hassan district.**********Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa has directed the District in-charge Ministers to take precautionary measures in the wake of heavy rainfall across the State.From his hospital ward, the CM on Thursday instructed all his Cabinet colleagues to remain in their constituencies and tour the damaged areas. He also directed them to undertake relief distribution and other necessary measures.The CM said that the government has already released Rs 50 crore for relief and rescue work. “More funds will be released if required,’’ he said.He also directed the officials to provide relief to the people affected by floods. “An immediate relief of Rs 10,000 to the families affected by rain and Rs 5 lakh to completely damaged houses and if the house is partially damaged relief must be distributed as per the damage,’’ the CM directed.Since the hostels, schools and colleges in district headquarters are converted into Covid Care Centres, the CM instructed officials to use the schools, colleges and other public places in villages as relief centres and provide all necessary facilities to the flood-affected families.",flood,Karnataka Floods 2021,"Karnataka, India",2021-08-05,2021-08-07,"['Tala Cauvery', 'Bhagamandala', 'Cauvery', 'Kodagu']","['11,811 cusecs', '43,667 cusecs', '84,806 cusecs', '84,806 cusecs']","['a family of five was trapped under a landslide', 'was also flooded due to the overflowing and its tributaries', 'many low lying areas around Nanjangud were submerged', 'the inflow at Hipparagi barrage was at 84,806 cusecs of water']",0,"['the reservoirs are filling up dangerously fast', 'the state reservoirs had around 47 per cent of the total capacity of water till July 31', 'the monsoon which was lull till recently, filling up most of the reservoirs, and causing flooding in many districts', 'the government has already released Rs 50 crore for relief and rescue work']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The next time it rains and you find yourself wondering which route to take to avoid floods, you may be able to access real-time information on your phone. The ‘Bengaluru Megha Sandesha’, a mobile app, promises to provide real-time information and alerts on weather, rainfall, flooding in Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) jurisdiction. It was launched by Revenue Minister R. Ashoka on Saturday.

The app provides data on three main modules – live weather, forecast, and safe routes. While live weather and forecast tabs provide location based information on prevailing temperature, rainfall, wind speed and direction, the safe route tab provides information on live rainfall and road inundation on all probable routes (location to destination).

Along with the app, a web portal ‘Varunamitra’ was also launched.

The bilingual app, in Kannada and English, has been developed by the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Management Centre (KSNDMC) in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.), Bengaluru.

Mr. Ashoka said that the app provides data from 100 Telemetric Rain Gauges (TRG), 12 telemetric weather stations (TWS) and water level sensors installed and maintained at various locations. “Both, the app and the web portal, will help people and civic agencies to tackle rain related issues,” he said.

An emergency tab will enable citizens to connect with BBMP emergency control rooms. Safety tips on Dos and Dont’s during rain and flooding will be provided, a KSNDMC official said.

Varunamitra portal

The government also launched ‘Varunamitra’, a dedicated web portal for weather information in BBMP areas. It will also provide details on flood vulnerable areas in each zone. It has a real-time weather dashboard that provides zone wise weather information, location specific rainfall and inundation, and colour coded information on flood severity.",solution,Bengaluru Floods,"Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",June 2020,June 2020,BBMP areas,100 mm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

It took nearly two days for the workers hired by the) to clear the water that had gushed onto themain road from the overflowing. Many motorists who took the road got stuck in the knee-deep water for hours both on Saturday and Sunday.Residents say thenearHospital floods even when the rainfall is not heavy. “When the upstream lakes such as Nallurahalli and Shilavanthanakere overflow, the rajakaluve is unable to take the load near the junction. This is because the culvert is narrow and secondly, a private builder has constructedand built a road on it. This is illegal but no action has been taken,”, a Whitefield resident, said.Govindaraju claimed the rajakaluve also has about 30 encroachments as per the data provided by BBMP in 2013. “The encroachment has gone up over the last seven years but the civic body has never made any efforts to clear them,” he said.The road held back traffic for nearly three km on each side of the junction. “The problem has crept up over the last three years. New buildings and constructions have come up. Ostensibly, some constructions have come over rajakaluves or drains have been made narrower. With very little rain, the whole place floods. The rajakaluve next to TZED was identified as the problem,” Whitefield Rising, a citizen group, tweeted.The issue was also raised during Hagadur ward committee meeting. MLA Arvind Limbavali and BBMP engineers inspected the junction. Clement Jayakumar, ex-corporator, said the BBMP has planned to build a new culvert.“The culvert that cuts across Whitefield main road is small. A BWSSB pipe is further blocking the rajakaluve.

***On the ground***

.

As parts ofgot pounded by the rains on Friday evening, residents of Dattatreya Layout in Hosakerehalli thought shutting their doors would keep them safe.Little did they realise that the height of the water gushing through their streets was over six feet -- water entered homes through windows and cracks in the walls, and rescue personnel had to break open roofs and doors to rescue people trapped inside.Like Arun R, who had locked himself in along with his elderly mother to wait for the storm to pass. As water gushed in, neighbours broke open the door allowing him and his mother to escape.Or like a 35-year-old resident of Dattatreya Layout who had to be rescued along with her two children -- a 5-month-old and a two-and-a-half-year-old son. She watched helplessly as the streets around her house steadily turned into a stream. As water started trickling in through her windows, she kept her children on a slab in the living room started screaming for help from the kitchen. Personnel from the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and fire departments had to cut open the asbestos sheet on top to rescue the three from the house.Stories of near-death experiences were all over the locality on Saturday as people tried to shake off the fear, filth and stench left in the wake of Friday’s downpour.Like the story of a 45-year-old man who was fast asleep when water started gushing in -- he realised his house was flooded only after water reached up to the level of his bed. He woke his family members up and they decided to go outside. Little did he know about the scene outside and as he opened the door, water gushed in sweeping him to the back of the house. Such was the force of the water that a bike parked outside was swept in.Though the downpour began on Friday evening, many residents went to sleep unaware of the nightmare that lay ahead. By midnight, an overflowing rajakaluve (stormwater drain) flooded all the low-lying areas around it. (Choked, encroached or faulty stormwater drains have resulted in flooding several times in the past, but no substantial action has been taken so far to address this problem).Over 120 people were rescued in the midnight operation at the layout, said Chandrashekar, Commandant of SDRF.Many stood on their balconies the whole night to be safe. Many had to stand outside their homes even on Saturday morning as they waited for the water to recede. Though the water was pumped out, the slush remained -- and the stench hung in the air.A 40-year-old woman said, “I had bought groceries for Vijayadashami and flowers for Ayudha pooja and now everything is washed away.”Another woman said their house had been cleaned for Ayudha pooja, but only slush remains in the house now.Praveen, who owns Sri Annapoorneshwari Sweets, a sweetmeat shop, toldMirror that he had got a lot of orders for sweets for Ayudha Pooja. He had prepared hundreds of kg of sweets to be distributed for the festival, but all the sweets have been washed away and he pegged his losses to be close to Rs 8 lakh. A food processing unit has come undone as its owner said that he has lost the printer, documents, and finished products while the machinery has been damaged by gushing water. Scores of vehicles have been damaged too; an estimate puts the number at 500.Many areas in Dattatreya Layout are low-lying and close to the rajakaluve which has been encroached upon at many places. Revenue Minister R Ashoka who visited the spot said that the width of the rajakaluve was uneven -- at some places, it was as narrow as 20 feet. He also blamed the encroachments, especially a temporary bridge that was illegally put up by a few locals. Officials said the retaining wall at this place was broken for this temporary bridge and a large volume of water spread out.Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa rushed to a few of the rain-affected areas. Later, he promised a relief fund of Rs 25,000 for each household affected by the rainfall.Many residents who had stayed in the balcony could not get into their houses on Saturday morning and the reason was that they were unable to open the doors. Now the biggest worry for residents is to clean the floors as ironically there was no clean water to clean the floor with or even to drink.As the flooding had happened on many narrow roads, it became difficult for the rescue teams to reach the spot with vehicles such as cars parked on the road blocking their access. So, the rescue team had to bring a tow machine first to tow away the cars and then bring in their relief vehicles.As CM was visiting a number of areas, people invited the CM to their houses. The police tried to stop the crowd saying that it was ‘impossible’ for the CM to visit every house.The CM had decided to move out after visiting a few areas. However, a few residents tried to block the officials’ cars and forced the CM to take one more round of inspection. When a newsman asked him why none of the ministers except Ashoka were seen on the ground, an angry Yediyurappa shot back, “This is not time for politicking. Why do you need more ministers when the CM himself is on the ground?”",flood,Bengaluru Floods 2020,south Bengaluru,2020-10-23,2020-10-24,"['Dattatreya Layout', 'Gurudatta Layout', 'Hosakerehalli']",['200 mm'],"['8 lakh worth of sweets were washed away', 'Scores of vehicles have been damaged', 'Many houses were flooded', 'Many people were rescued']",0,"['People were forced to stay on their balconies', 'Many people were unable to open their doors', 'There was no clean water to clean the floor with or even to drink', 'The rescue teams had to bring a tow machine first to tow away the cars and then bring in their relief vehicles']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

There is no chance of water flowing back in the new parallel drain. We have taken gradients into account –BS Prahlad, BBMP

Untitled Carousel Bengaluru: BBMP collects Rs 75 lakh fine for littering Amid its Covid-19 enforcement duties that demand on-road vigilance, the BBMP has intensified crackdown on solid waste management violations. It has collected nearly Rs 75 lakh as fine from violators from June 1 till October 27.

Plan is to lay a huge pipeline under the road to carry excess rainwater from low-lying areas toA large portion ofwill be closed for about two months. Apparently citizens will have to grin and bear the inconvenience as it is for a greater cause. The idea is to lay a huge pipeline under the road that can carry excess rainwater from the low-lying areas to Bellandur lake. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike () is currently waiting for the green signal from the traffic police to do this work as part of the flood mitigation project that took off last year and is 65 per cent done.About 650 metres of the busy road betweenand awill be dug to lay the pipeline that will take out rainwater from two secondary drains at Koramangala 4th Block. The new plan is expected to put an end to the frequent reverse-flow of excess rainwater from the rajakaluve, resulting in an almost annual flood-like situation in the residential layout that has over 1,000 houses.The BBMP has almost finished the work related to constructing a box drain and laying pipeline between Seva-in-Action junction and Bellandur lake. Officials said the pipeline will be laid about 2.9 metres below the surface along the Koramangala 80 ft Road and the depth will be around 3.4 metres at the Seva-in-Action. “There is no chance of water flowing back in the new parallel drain. We have taken gradients into account while designing the plan,” BS Prahlad, Chief Engineer (Storm Water drain) at BBMP, told Bangalore Mirror. He said the project will be ready by December-end.While some residents fear the project may not entirely help in mitigating floods, others are waiting for the BBMP to complete the project. Nithin Seshadri, a resident of Koramangala said the parallel drain will be of no use if the storm water is not allowed to flow into the Bellandur lake. “Currently, the diversion channel built around the lake is very narrow. It won’t be able to take the water load that is flowing all the way from City market,” he said.Another resident of Koramangala dismissed this worry and said that the BBMP would ensure the water flows to the lake.“The same consultant who designed the drain is in charge of the Bellandur lake rejuvenation plan. The flow of water has been definitely taken into account. It’s a wonderful project. It will prevent flooding as well as help in rejuvenation of Bellandur lake. The BBMP took a lot of time for execution as it encouraged quite a few challenges,” a resident of Koramangala Fourth Block said.On Wednesday, BBMP Administrator Gaurav Gupta had inspected the work along with engineers. He had instructed officials to complete the project in one-and-a-half months. The BBMP has also planned to white-top the 1.80-km stretch of Koramangala 80 feet Road.

BBMP authorities say these might enable measured release of water from lakesAfter many lakes along the Hebbal valley overflowed, leading to a flood-like situation in North Bengaluru recently,(BBMP) is mulling over the idea of constructingat the waste weir of the lakes. This is the second time in the recent past that the officials are contemplating over such a proposal, which, they say, could prevent floods when the city experiences heavy rainfall.Officials believe the sluice gates will help the BBMP empty the lakes ahead of monsoon so that when it rains heavily, the lakes have enough water holding capacity. This provision is not currently available in any lakes that have waste weirs but are much above the lake bed. The sluice gates, they say, could be constructed at the level of lake bed, enabling emptying of the entire lake, if necessary.“Excess rainwater started flowing downstream, starting from Hebbal lake to Nagawara and then towardsandlakes. Even the rajalakuves could not take such load as they were designed to take only about 40-50 mm of rainwater,” B Prahlad, Chief Engineer (Storm water drain) at BBMP toldMirror. “If there was a provision to either fully or partly empty the lakes in a regulated manner ahead of monsoon, we could have avoided flooding,” he added.Mohan Krishna, Chief Engineer (Lakes) at BBMP, also agreed that sluice gates will enable regulated and measured release of water from the lakes. However, he added that it is difficult to predict heavy rainfall. “Emptying lake water may not always work if the anticipated rainfall does not take place,” he said.V Ramaprasad, convener of, said the proposal is a good idea but it should be executed with proper study. “There are many flaws in the detailed project reports, which are presently done. Building such projects on the basis of flawed reports could be dangerous. The project requires meticulous hydraulic and hydro geology study so that the water does not backflow,” he said. Sluice gates work only if there is regular maintenance. “If the gates are not handled properly, they could lead to flooding in a massive scale,” he said. He also suggested the BBMP to adopt siphon system introduced by SirVeena Srinivasan, a fellow at Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment (ATREE), said the BBMP should come up with a comprehensive study and identify many alternatives before picking one. “While I do not completely have any objections to the sluice gate proposal, the BBMP should first come up with simulation model with different scenarios,” she said.",solution,2022 Bangalore Floods,"Bangalore, India","July 25, 2022","July 27, 2022","['Horamavu', 'Kalkere']","['100 mm, 150 mm']","['$10 million', '$20 million']","['1, 2']","['Thousands of people were displaced from their homes.', 'Infrastructure was damaged.', 'Businesses were closed.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

This is not the first time the city has faced severe deluge, however. In August 2000 also, the city had been flooded, after which the Geological Survey of India carried out studies to understand what led to the phenomenon. In its report on the floods, the GSI listed the causes for the flood and recommendations for future. Here’s what it said.

Hyderabad floods: Causes for 2000 deluge

The GSI report listed the following causes for flooding:

Some residential areas, like in Nallakunta, have been raised by blocking Musi River’s prominent tributary. This leads to such residential properties being inundated.

The report also noted that several water tanks had been converted into residential areas, like converting the Masab Tank into a densely populated area. Such conversions have caused active streams of River Musi on the downstream sides to be completely blocked. Moreover, such colonies have also led to the tampering of the natural path of surface drainage and as a result, get flooded if rainfall occurs for five to six consecutive hours.

In the Langar Hauz residential area, the northern and northeastern parts are in low-lying areas having slopes. Moreover, these areas also have active streams running in the middle, causing them to get flooded.

Some colonies with a lot of population, like in Ashok Nagar and Gandhi Nagar, are located on Hussain Sagar tank’s downstream side. Consequently, during the floods, water emerging out is blocked by the colonies and these residential areas get flooded instead.

The GSI said that the 2000 floods helped in bringing into limelight the issues in the urban planning of the city.

166,1244,bangalore,2020,https://www.newsclick.in/hyderabad-floods-global-vision-india-cities-compromised-liveability,19 Nov 2020,Hyderabad Floods: How a ‘Global Vision’ for India’s Cities Has Compromised Liveability,"Its been over a month since Hyderabad flooded, and there are still areas in the city which continue to deal with its aftermath with rainwater yet to recede. While Hyderabad continues its infrastructural development under the rubric of missions like the Smart City mission, it remains ill-equipped to deal with its annual rainfall, let alone extreme rainfall events like the recent floods.

On September 30, in the run up to the civil polls in Hyderabad, the State Minister for Urban Development and IT, K.T. Rama Rao, announced that the government had spent over Rs 67,000 crore over the past five years on various development works throughout the city. The declaration came just a few days before the city was brought to its knees by the devastating floods on October 13. Despite the investment, Hyderabad’s unpreparedness surely calls for a hard look into understanding what happened and how the impact can be mitigated in the future.

The city’s history of responding to disasters such as floods, or even events of heat stress remain reactionary measures which do not last long. When such reactionary measures are part of city planning, where does climate resilience come in? More importantly, what does climate resilience mean for Indian cities? The focus of urban planning has to increasingly take into account the transient nature of the city and its population.

Hyderabad is not alone in facing the repercussions of human-induced climate change. Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai have all experienced damaging levels of flooding. The latter two also contend with a depleting groundwater supply and various cities have been experiencing intolerable heat waves. This, along with Delhi’s out-of-control air pollution, reinforces that this is not a problem unique to Hyderabad, but rampant across India.

The last time the city of Hyderabad faced such intense rainfall was more than a hundred years ago, in 1908. In response, the then ruler of Hyderabad, the Nizam, built the Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar dams, which simultaneously protected the city from flood waters and provided drinking water. The way city planning took shape after the floods set the tone for infrastructural development for Hyderabad, its commons and its resources. Commons such as agricultural lands, rivers, lakes, streams, pasture lands thrived under the Nizam administration. A look back at Hyderabad’s urban development, urbanisation and its flood management policies since those floods hints at why the floods in 2020 were as devastating and what future city planning desperately needs.

The idea of infrastructure development for a metropolitan has, so far, meant the metro, bridges, roads and buildings, which today represents civic infrastructure. However, what is often overlooked are energy, water, spatial, and people’s infrastructures.

What Happened After 1908?

As part of the measures to protect the city from future floods, river banks between the Chaddarghat and the Purana Pul bridge were raised by 30 ft andlined with parks and government buildings – the high court, city college, Osmania Hospital and the Asafiya Library – over the next two decades, by 1931. A systematic forsaking of the commons and the land-use patterns and activities associated with the commons began with its inhabitants gradually moving away from engaging with the Musi river.

The natural and the socio-ecological environment around the Musi began transforming with a sense of modernisation influenced by the British and western views of refurbishing Indian cities, mirroring a trend seen in the rest of the country. In fact, the employment of the famed planner M. Visvesvaraya and the building of the two dams was considered a significant technological milestone back then. However, this process of modern urbanisation was not triggered by the floods, it only accentuated the process. The British built the Secunderabad Club, the Koti Residency, and the Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption, and more of the city’s elites began to move north, closer to the power centre, where earlier elites had already begun to move after the 1908 floods. At the time of the flood, the city covered 26 sq. miles, while the population recorded in 1901 was 4,48,466.

While the Nizam did follow a modernisation-driven plan, in the wake of the 1908 floods, the administration developed several lakes to complement the existing network of irrigation systems and formed a channel of such water bodies. When the Nizam responded to the floods, it wasn’t merely mitigation and reducing the risk from a consecutive flooding event, it was integrated with transforming the water and economic infrastructure of the city, making the Nizam’s vision much more futuristic than visions shaping today’s cities.

While the changes to the water channels by building tanks and dams meant that the city was now well prepared, it is not the entire story. The natural resources within the city, along with the vision of incorporating commons as part of the city’s survival and resilience, were gradually abandoned after the 1908 floods, charting the trajectory to the city’s present vision of modern development.

From Planned Urbanisation to ‘Master Plans’

Although the city of Hyderabad saw very little urban planning since Independence, it saw regulated and planned urban development during the Nizam and the Qutb Shahi eras.

The Nizam set up the City Improvement Board (CIB) in the aftermath of the floods to address housing, sanitation and the urban design issues of the city. Until 1941, the CIB undertook 45 projects that ranged from infrastructure, transportation and slum clearance, to economics. Infrastructure projects focused on water systems, bridges, and city beautification while the economic projects looked at building markets and creating industrial areas. Thus, the CIB addressed the spatial, water, waste, and social infrastructure needs of the city.

In 1948, the CIB and its projects were all dissolved into the Andhra Pradesh Housing Board. Following post-colonial urban growth, the urban built-up area increased exponentially after economic liberalisation in the early-1990s. The urban build-up is also accompanied by a rapidly increasing population. Today, Hyderabad has a population of 70 lakh, with the floating population close to one crore.

The city underwent major changes between 1989 and 2011, promoting the IT sector to replace the traditional manufacturing sector, establishing HITEC City, the expansion of the industrial sector with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology factories, and building the Outer Ring Road (ORR). The city’s sprawl since the 90’s was exacerbated by its master plans and parastatal bodies which were outside the functioning of the city’s municipal corporation. A few provisions of the 1975 Development Plan for the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad and the then state-led world-class city vision, resulted in major road-widening projects between 1995 and 2001. The subsequent master plans of 1994 and 2020 significantly changed the city’s agrarian-focus to making Hyderabad a globally important city. These plans brought in major changes in land-use patterns, where land allocated by the government for agriculture was used for government buildings, cultural shopping centres and IT complexes.

The gradual vanishing of the city’s commons and open spaces was now coupled with rapid urban expansion. The Master Plan for Cyberabad Development Authority Area (CDA), which came into effect in 2001, further hastened the process of replacing the city’s spatial and water infrastructure with civic and business infrastructure. The CDA had autonomous governance that did not come under the jurisdiction of the then Hyderabad Urban Development Authority.

About 40% of the area designated as a Special Economic Zone under the CDA was the catchment zone of the Himayatsagar lake. This happened alongside the Master Plan for the Hyderabad Airport Development Authority, which triggered similar land-use changes in the southern parts of the city. The by-passing of the local civic bodies and creating autonomous, parastatal bodies for governance that looked to the west and created ‘global’ pockets in the city, began with the Industrial Area Local Authority (IALA) which was instrumental in developing the Serilingampally area. Such initiatives in the city set a precedence for local governance which now worked in silos and offered little chance for convergence.

The 2031 Master Plan, a globalised, technically-designed plan, is a three-stage plan for expansion and transformation of the urban-rural fringe. The three stages involve transformation of agricultural land use, changes in occupational structure and the increase of urban land-use growth.

Most of the Qutb Shahi era infrastructure has been hidden within the twenty-first century urban sprawl, and the low-lying areas today are sacrificial sites for the cities’ growth project and its planners, where new infrastructure barely makes its way in. This is clearly unsustainable and calls for a change in the way city planners look at infrastructure – aiding resource-flow monitoring instead of traffic. Resilience needs to take into account the rupture in our imaginaries that not only drives this “global city” planning agenda, but increasingly alienates and marginalises slums and their inhabitants, and push them out of sight.

The City’s Resilience

Various reports have pointed out the city’s inadequate storm water drainage (SWD) system, which reportedly covers less than 30% of the city. The existing storm water drainage network in the city, which covers the major storm drains and is spread over 390 kms, is designed to handle rainfall between 15 – 20 mm per hour. It means that it can handle more than the 290 mm per day average rainfall that the city received during the floods in October.

However, because of issues of silting and deposition of solid waste, networks are clogged and fail to handle the water. Moreover, the minor drains across the rest of the city, which were proposed to be widened to handle 100 mm of rainfall per day, cannot withstand such heavy rainfall. Also, low-lying areas even defy major storm drains sometimes, since the rate of inundation varies with the intensity of the rainfall. While major areas under the GHMC limits received rainfall of above 200 mm, the outskirts – Ghatkesar received 324.8 mm of rainfall followed by 300 mm at Vanasthalipuram and 298 mm at Pedda Amberpet and Hayathnagar – which still run on the over century-old Nizam-era storm water drainage systems which are not equipped to deal with the rampant urbanisation since.

The Kirloskar Committee appointed by the then-united Andhra Pradesh government, which identified the reasons for flooding in the year 2000, noted that there were 13,500 illegal structures built on top of 390 kms of drains. This rampant construction of illegal structures is a direct result of the city planning narrative which has been adopted over the decades, one of global-city civic infrastructure development.

The 2020 Master Plan and CDA Master Plan are examples of how the civic infrastructure has been prioritised over water infrastructure and resilience measures. In fact, the 2020 Master Plan states that the cost of a new and improved drainage system have to be borne by the people living in the area and that ‘there is no way whatsoever to meet these costs.’

The focus has also been unfairly narrowed down to encroachments alone, which is far from a reality. The growth of the city and its unplanned metastasis is the problem, of which illegal encroachment is only a part.

The non-structural measures for flood resilience and preparedness are highly politicised and driven by the state’s vision and market infrastructure, further isolating city planning from its governing bodies and its socio-ecological contexts. The implementations of the Master Plans and the nature of their diverting trajectories are a testament to how the city has delineated itself from actively planning to work towards resilient measures. Today, it is forced to react to each flooding event by picking up the pieces year after year. The vision of a ‘global city’ has compromised the ability of Hyderabad to deal with extreme weather events like floods.

However, given the climate-induced extreme weather events, the question arises: should the city prepare for flooding that might occur even once in 20 years if not in a hundred years? Somewhere between preparing for urban floods every year and the deadly once-in-a-century extreme weather event, our systems of resilience need to be developed. Amid this trajectory, the city’s history of responding to disasters such as floods or even events of heat stress remains reactionary, with measures that have no lasting effect.

Unmapping resilience

We must examine what got us into this fix, and must re-examine the top-down approach of implementing a global vision for cities, which doesn’t often take into account local experiences. This approach is not just unique to Hyderabad, but is imitated across the country. This narrow global vision has brought us here. The most aggressive impacts of climate-change influenced disasters are only beginning to be felt now, in the form of floods and deadly heat waves.

In this continuing trend of climate impact, where such extreme weather events are predicted to increase in frequency, we are looking at future cities that will become un-liveable. Today’s city and its infrastructure is made of reinforced concrete structures that are short-lived and brittle, making a city’s foundation delicate by itself. And if the city’s planning allows it to flood, in addition to the impending extreme weather events, we can expect a much more decreased life expectancy for cities.

Resilience doesn’t and shouldn’t begin with extreme events – even as they are triggered by such events – it should be an increment of capacity building for existing infrastructure. The political economy of resilience needs to be exposed, where extreme weather events like heat stress need to adopt a lens of social vulnerability, one that looks for solutions beyond technological or infrastructural quick-fixes.

For instance, heat stress, when viewed through an infrastructural lens, accommodates the elite who can bypass it with cooling infrastructures, similar to how the elites during the Nizam were able to move away from the flood-prone banks of the Musi. A political economy of resilience considers the capabilities of communities that are the most vulnerable to face and adapt to such extreme events. We need to increasingly weave in local livelihoods, intersectional and disproportionate impacts of yearly weather on different communities within the city, to come up with a more robust plan for the city’s resilience.

There are avenues for the state to adopt such a vision into city planning. For instance, the Government of India has initiated the program called Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). It focuses on the provision of water supply, sewerage, storm water drains, green spaces and public transport in 500 cities in India. The 2019 Manual on Storm Drainage defines the norms and rules for the design of sustainable drainage systems.

The first step, however, would be for the state government to revise its 2031 Master Plan to prioritise protection and active rejuvenation of the urban commons, such farm and scrub lands, that act as natural sponges for absorbing the rain water. This would essentially mean converging and integrating the many schemes and missions that are simultaneously being implemented in the city – be it the Smart Cities Mission or AMRUT or the National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM) – they need to speak with each other, and more importantly, engage with the civic bodies in the cities rather than work autonomously, creating yet another parastatal body.

While the smart city missions have been made to incorporate various infrastructure changes in the city, not all of them necessarily trickle down to accommodating the needs of the urban working class, its slum dwellers, the migrants and the informal workers in terms of addressing their needs for housing, transport and livelihoods, especially those that are traditionally embedded with the commons, and have been replaced over the decades for various development projects. Such a convergence would mean integrating and mapping intersections that invariably affect each other, but it would also mean effectively managing the financing of these missions, which currently derive their funds through multiple complex sources, hindering their implementation.

In addition to ensuring that these missions and schemes don’t compete with each other for space and jurisdiction, they should also ensure that they increasingly take into account the voices of the people who have been marginalised and displaced over the decades to make space for private infrastructure and special economic zones, such as in Mumbai and Gujarat. The reiteration of the existing socio-economic inequalities and hierarchies through the smart cities missions needs to be combated. To address these concerns, there is a need for rejecting a global-vision driven solution for all cities together under the rubric of a centralised mission. There is a need for such missions be decentralised and to speak to each other to integrate technical knowledge with traditional understanding of land-use patterns.

Integrating the city’s commons into its fold of resilience measures requires an understanding of what was historically forgotten, like the abandonment of living with the Musi and its revival. This can happen through ‘unmapping’ the city and identifying its commons and evolving the current day urban planning practices to be make space for more spatial and social infrastructure within the city.

Nearly 15 lakh people have been affected by floods in 11 districts of Bihar, and at least 10 have lost their lives in the deluge, the disaster management department said on Sunday.

According to the department, Darbhanga is the worst-affected district, as 5.36 lakh people there have either been displaced or are trapped inside their homes.

Floodwaters have entered homes in Bishunpur village of Darbhanga district, forcing people to wade through waist-deep water, even as they try and salvage their valuables.

“We witness flood every year, but this year all records have been broken,” a resident of the village said.

Similarly, many people in Mabbi village of the district and some from the adjoining areas have come out to live on the streets, as portions of their houses have been washed away in the deluge.

A total of 131 panchayats of 12 blocks of Darbhanga district have been affected by the flood, the department said in its bulletin.

In Muzaffarpur district, over two lakh people have been affected, while the number of sufferers in East Champaran has touched 2.72 lakh, the bulletin stated.

As many as 1.36 lakh people have been evacuated from the marooned areas so far, the department said, adding that 14,011 people have put up in 26 relief camps.

Around 1.77 lakh people were being fed at 463 community kitchens in the state.

Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopters have dropped food packets in several flood-hit areas. Each packet contains two-and-half kg of rice, one kg gram, 500 gm jaggery, a match box and packet of candles.

Meanwhile, a woman delivered a baby on one of the rescue boats of NDRF’s 9th battalion in East Champaran. The newborn’s mother hailed from Gobari village of the district.

With the rains subsiding in southern Maharashtra and northern Karnataka districts, the threat of further floods in North Karnataka also seems to be fading. However, as a precaution, authorities in several districts are busy evacuating residents from flood-prone villages and localities to relief centres set up at higher altitudes.

Officials in Maharashtra have indicated a further reduction in discharge into the Krishna river. Water release from the reservoirs, that had been on the rise in the past week, remained stable on Tuesday. According to officials, if it does not rain in the next few days, the water levels in the reservoirs would recede further as the outflow levels have been kept constant.

In Belagavi district, 150 families from six villages have been evacuated. “Malaprabha waters entered parts of Ramdurg, but as the threat was not serious there was no evacuation,” Deputy Commissioner M.G. Hiremath said. Following the increased inflow into Ghataprabha river, parts of Gokak and nearby areas were flooded. NDRF and SDRF teams have been posted in villages and sub-division levels.

The situation in Dharwad, Gadag, and Haveri improved comparatively on Tuesday. There was no further rise in the water level in the streams and rivers of the districts. Several tanks in these districts have been overflowing, partially inundating the localities downstream. But there have been no reports of casualties.

In the Kalyana Karnataka region, the outflow from Basava Sagar into the Krishna was increased to 2.54 lakh cusecs on Tuesday evening. The water level in the reservoir stood at 490.01 m, as against the FRL of 492.25 m. The bridge constructed across the Krishna between Huvinadagi and Kollur villages that connects Raichur and Kalaburagi district via Yadgir continued to be submerged in floodwaters. Traffic had to be diverted.

Meanwhile, the day-long joint operation by the NDRF and the Telengana and Karnataka police to retrieve the bodies of four persons from Kuravakula islet who were washed away in the swollen Krishna on Monday did not yield any results.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Many areas of Bengaluru continue to be flooded with waist-deep water after the rain havoc of Tuesday night.One of them is Sai Layout in Cauvery Nagar of Horamavu ward in KR Puram. For the last three days, it has become a living hell for the residents. Despite repeated complaints from residents, authorities continued to neglect their pleas, as water from clogged storm water drains overflowed into the entire locality.Most residents haven’t slept for three days and are wading through waist-deep water. “Water stagnation is common during the monsoon. But this time water entered our homes,” said, a software engineer, who had the foresight to send her gadgets to her neighbour’s house. “We have not had power for the last three days. My father is a diabetic and my mom suffers from hypertension. I had to quickly move them to a safer location,” she said.Another resident, Shajahan was wading through the waist-deep water to collect some household items that had floated away. “Both my daughter and I have lost our laptops due to the flooding. This was an office-issue laptop,” said Shajahan.John HD, owner of RJ Stores, too, has incurred a huge loss. “For years, we have been complaining about the annual flooding that takes place, but all has been in vain,” said John.With ground floors flooded, many residents took shelter in their neighbours’ homes which had a first floor. Apart from homes, many vehicles, including four-wheelers, were submerged in rainwater.The residents blamed thefor not clearing choked drains. To add to this, two secondary drains were also blocked with the pillars of an arch constructed by the temple management in the locality. “MLA Byrathi Basavaraj has sponsored the construction of an arch and pillars at the entrance,” said, treasurer, Sri Shirdi Sai Darshan Trust, Sai Layout. A few workers had to cut the road near the arch to make way for water to enter the storm water drain.While Horamavu ward corporator Radhamma Venkatesh was busy at the BBMP Head office, the supporters of Minister for Urban Development Byrathi Basavaraj were seen supplying food and drinking water to the residents. “The storm water drain is much bigger than the vent at the railway track near. While the storm water drain is 100 ft wide, the vent at the railway track is only 10 ft wide. So whenever it rains heavily, this locality is flooded with water from the drain,” said Lakshmipathy, husband of Horamavu ward corporator Radhamma.At 1.30am on Wednesday, residents of SMC Beverly Villas apartment in upscale Dollars Colony, saw their basement get flooded with gushing waters. The area is about a kilometre away from Hebbal lake. “There were at least four cars in front of me, trying to make their way onto the road from basement but it was not possible as the road was full of water. We had a narrow escape,” said 62-year-old Ravi, president of the apartment association. The basement had around 30 cars.N.L Jayasimha, a businessman living in the apartment said the insurance companies had directed them not to start their cars. Officials took more than 24 hours to remove the water from the basement,” he added.M. Anand, corporator of Radhakrishna Ward, under whose limits the apartment falls, said only one part of the Dollars Colony was affected by floods.“We had completed drain work but the rajakaluve started overflowing as water was flowing back from Hebbal lake.

Former MLA, Roshan Baig has been remanded in police custody for three days till November 28 by the CBI special court in Bengaluru on Wednesday.

Baig who is in Parappana Agrahara Central Jail will be brought to CBI office. On Sunday, the CBI arrested Roshan Baig in connection with the Rs 4,000-crore ponzi scheme in which he allegedly received several crores of kickbacks.

More than 40,000 investors, mostly from the Muslim community, were duped of their savings by arrested businessman Mohammed Mansoor Khan, who owns the IMA Group. Baig’s name emerged when the scam surfaced nearly 18 months ago. Khan had fled the country but was arrested and brought back from Dubai in July 2019 by the Bengaluru police crime branch.



In a video released while he was in hiding, Khan had claimed that several state politicians and officials had coerced him into paying bribes, leading to the downfall of IMA. And one of them, who he claimed had received nearly Rs 400 crore, was Baig, the then Congress MLA from Shivajinagar constituency in central Bengaluru.



During investigations in mid 2019, police found documents in which a key associate of Khan had recorded payments made to politicians, policemen, and government officials. It showed Baig as a key recipient of funds.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Short supply at a few village fairs for a couple of weeks may affect prices in Bengaluru. But market forces will come into play and prices will be stabilised soon –BL Chidananda, UAS

Acute supply shortage from inside the state after the floods a few months ago combined with harvest season have contributed to the price riseMuttonin Bengaluru have hit an all-time high over the last two weeks. In some areas, the prices have touched to Rs 1,000 per kg. The unprecedented and sudden rise is attributed to a combination of two events. Firstly, Northfloods a few months ago and secondly, the harvest season. “The floods had induced farmers to distress selling of their livestock and there is a shortage now. Second, availability of enough fodder during the harvest season means that farmers just want to fatten their stock,” said Venkatesh of the Venkateshwara Meat Centre.Dr BL Chidananda, head of Animal Sciences,, said that the attribution to the recent floods is overstated. “Some animals perished, but that can’t be the sole reason for the price rise now. The current spike can be due to the harvest season,” he said.Bengaluru receives a large number of sheep and goats for consumption from Koppal, Athani,and Aminagad. These are the heavier variety of animals. The demand for meat from smaller animals has seen some meat stalls selling mutton at two different prices. Mutton from older sheep/goats is being sold a good Rs 100 per kg lower than meat from lambs and younger animals. And even strangely enough, prices of meat in various parts of Bengaluru show a wide variance. While in some localities the prices are between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000 per kg, in some others it is around Rs 550 and 650 per kg.“Eight to 12 kg of carcass weight after dressing is the global standard. For this, the live animals should be between 16 and 20 kg. People prefer meat from younger animals because it is softer. It is called ‘ele mamsa’ in Kannada. At retail stores there is normally no distinction and mutton from both kinds of animals are sold at the same price. But due to the unprecedented spike these days, mutton is now available at two different prices in the same shop,” Chidananda said.The younger sheep is procured for the Bengaluru market from surrounding places like Turuvekere, Gubbi and Magadi. ‘Mutton’ Murthy, a dealer in sheep said, “In rural fairs, a 10-kilo sheep now costs Rs 6,000. A vaata (male goat) can cost Rs 7,000. Retailers can make profit only by selling offal at these prices.”Chidananda said this is because the ‘recovery’ from sheep/goat is only 50 per cent. “Meat from the carcass forms only 50 per cent of the weight of a live animal in the case of sheep and goats. In poultry, it is 70 per cent. The rise in price of live animals squeezes the margin of retailers and that is why they have increased prices to this extent,” he said.Since much of the sheep/goat trade is unorganised, stabilisation of prices may take a while. “Unlike poultry, mutton is unorganised. Short supply in a few village fairs for a couple of weeks may affect prices in some areas of Bengaluru. But market forces will come into play and prices will be stabilised soon,” he said.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
175,1253,bangalore,2020,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/assam-bihar-rain-floods-monsoon-6546377/,9 Aug 2020,"Rain, rain, go away","She was only four, Nazma Khatun remembers. The Beki river, which surrounds Majidbhita char, the riverine island where she lives in Assam’s Barpeta district, had reached right up to the foot of her bed, where she and her mother Shahnaaz Parbin lay that afternoon.

“I had never seen the water so close,” recalls Nazma, her memory still vivid 10 years later. As her mother napped, Nazma crawled to the edge of the bed, tied to four poles to raise it above the ground — the only “safe” space in the inundated home. “I reached out to touch the water, and fell right in.” The splash woke up her mother, who scooped her out just in time.

Two years back, her cousin’s five-month-old son fell into the water, the exact same way Nazma had all those monsoons ago. This time, “the river took the baby away”. Like for the 14-year-old, floods are a part of life for Assam, a cycle of destruction and rebuilding affecting hundreds. Many of its victims are children — for reasons not unlike that which almost killed Nazma.

In the past two years, 86 minors have died in Assam in floods. This year, they account for 49 deaths (45.5% of the total 110). UNICEF puts the number of them affected at 27 lakh. The 2020 floods have been particularly devastating, with two waves of heavy rain in close succession in July. M S Manivannan, Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) Chief Executive Officer, said they are planning a panel to look into the deaths of children.

Nazma recalls escaping death. Express Photo Nazma recalls escaping death. Express Photo

Nazma’s Barpeta district, one of the worst-hit, has seen 21 deaths, 12 of them children. A few drowned playing; others fell from boats, or slipped while bathing; while, another, a two-year-old at Kalgachia Circle, rolled over in his sleep into the water, just like Nazma and her nephew. “In school, they tell us not to go near the water,” Nazma says, “but when you are young, you do not understand the risks.” Nazma is a student of Class 9 at a school located 2 km away, accessible only by boat.

She, her parents and her brother, 7, share a one-room house, with walls made of mora paat (jute), which they cultivate. Their two cots are still the safest ground when the rains come. The family owns barely two bighas of land now, having lost at least 10 bighas to the river.

Her father used to teach at a local school, but hasn’t been getting his salary since it shut due to the pandemic.

Till a few years ago, the family would go to a make-shift relief camp — a platform with a tin roof — when the floods came. But now, they prefer home. “Those camps are crowded, and we have to share space with animals,” says Shahnaaz, Nazma’s mother. In one such flood a couple of years ago, the 14-year-old lost all her school notes and drawings to the water. “I salvaged some. But the ink had run, the writing barely legible.”

So now Nazma keeps her textbooks, notebooks and drawings — along with the family’s birth certificates, PAN cards and NRC papers — in plastic bags. The family stocks these on a shelf called saang built under the roof. “Once you lose your documents, you lose everything,” she says.

The family has stopped trying to save the few pieces of furniture they own — a clothes shelf or aalna, and some tables.

This year, the rains started pelting down in June. One morning, Nazma saw her parents running around, stacking tables, putting the stove right at the top; packing their clothes, food items and documents in bundles; and stowing everything away in the saang. And, she knew, the flood was here.

Rima Das of Kohora 1 village on the edge of the Kaziranga National Park, escaped the floods on bhoors or rafts made of banana tree trunks. Rima Das of Kohora 1 village on the edge of the Kaziranga National Park, escaped the floods on bhoors or rafts made of banana tree trunks.

It’s toughest to keep the fear away at night, Nazma says. She used to have nightmares earlier of falling into the water, but has outgrown them. At eight, she learnt to swim. The family talks or plays Ludo on the solitary mobile phone they own through such nights. The village is yet to get electricity, and depends on solar panels.

A few days ago, in the last heavy downpour, four of Nazma’s family six goats and several hens and ducks were washed away.

“The government has not provided us any facilities,” says their neighbour, 28-year-old Zahedul Islam. “There is nothing here except for a lower primary school.”

Dr Madhulika Jonathan, Chief of Field Office, UNICEF Assam, says the children in the state have been rendered even more vulnerable due to Covid-19. “We could not carry out flood awareness programmes as we have been busy,” admits Nandita Dutta, ASDMA Project Officer in Barpeta district.

Debarati Guha-Sapir, the director of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disaster in Belgium, who has studied floods in India, says children are more susceptible as they can’t gauge the depth of the waters. “Moreover, often many mothers have more than one child. She is able to only protect her youngest,” Guha told The Indian Express.

Some 300 km away from Nazma, 11-year-old Rima Das of Kohora 1 village on the edge of the Kaziranga National Park, escaped the floods on bhoors or rafts made of banana tree trunks. The family took shelter in a shop on National Highway-37. A drawing she made of her village shows people in chest-deep water, carrying their belongings on their heads. Rima took this drawing with her to the shelter.

Nazma wishes the government would give them money to at least raise their huts to a level that the waters can’t enter them. “Or, maybe, build a bridge so that we don’t have to take the boat to school.”

In earlier years, the government would hold classes for older children in schools that were not flooded. “But now with Covid, schools are shut,” says Preetom Saikia, Commissioner and Secretary, Elementary and Secondary Education, admitting they are yet to consider an online initiative for flood-affected children.

Rima says her wish is to live across the other side of the national highway, a higher ground where she has heard the floods are not as devastating. Nazma laughs that she can move “just about anywhere” with her family — “Just that place should not flood”.

Srikant Kumar, 12

Marhaura, Saran

The family of seven is now living under a tent on a railway platform. Express Photo by Santosh Singh The family of seven is now living under a tent on a railway platform. Express Photo by Santosh Singh

Silhauri Halt barely stirs to life at most times — with all of two daily train stops, that too now paused because of the Covid crisis. The “Halt”, as locals call it, was more the product in 2007 of Saran having an MP in railway minister (Lalu Prasad) at the time, than any real demand, with the Marhura Railway Station just 1.8 km away.

Srikant Kumar, 12, had never been more thankful for it as on August 1 night, when water gushed into the family’s house.

“My sisters, brother, mother and I, we ran with what we could to the Halt,” says Srikant. In the panic to save their six sacks of wheat, four cows, the fodder, utensils and clothes, the 12-year-old forgot his books and notebooks. He salvaged some later, but not the register with his math notes. “It is important to survive first,” reasons the Class 8 student.

For a week since, the railway platform has been home to 50 families like Srikant’s.

Located near the Ganga and Gandak rivers, this is Saran’s worst flood in 20 years, with over 75% of the population (3 lakh-odd people) of Marhaura, Amnaur and Masrakh blocks affected, and two deaths. Across the state, says Disaster Management Department Principal Secretary Pratyaya Amrit, 69 lakh people are affected, and 21 dead. Of the dead, eight were children.

“About 4.8 lakh people have been evacuated. We are running 1,402 kitchens for about 10 lakh people,” the official adds.

Bihar is not new to annual floods and devastation, with more than 50 lakh people affected every year. The state Disaster Management Department does not keep a separate record of deaths of children.

Marhaura is located around 50 km from the Gandak embankment, and got flooded after a major breach in it on July 24-25 night.

The waters took Srikant, who had never seen such a flood before, by surprise.

Water Resources Minister Sanjay Jha said, “The main reasons for the floods this year is the breach of approach roads to bridges and embankments, caused due to largely rains and surplus discharge of water from Nepal in the Kosi, Gandak and other rivers. We repair enbankments before every monsoon, but excess water often causes breaches.”

Srikant’s home still remains under water, and the family of seven now lives under a tarpaulin tent.

The family had sown paddy on their two bighas, which is lost. Mother Lilauti Devi had saved some money by selling milk, and they used it to buy rice. Srikant’s father died three years ago of a heart attack, leaving her with seven daughters and two sons. Three of the daughters are married.

Srikant’s elder brother Chandan, who is in Class 12, got married last year. His wife is with her parents in another Saran village.

Less than 2 km away, over 1,500 people have made the Marhaura Railway Station platform and a train stationed there home. Ravi Ranjan Rai, whose 35-member family is living in a compartment of the train, says: “I have never seen such a deluge.”

The state government has opened a community kitchen at Marhaura, where lunch and dinner are served to around a thousand people. Srikant’s family seldom goes there; the road too is under water.

Lilauati cooks on wood fire — “we have not got the Modiwala cylinder (Ujjwala scheme benefit),” she says. But the cow-dung cakes are moist after the floods and give out a lot of smoke.

Srikant has heard that the people at the Marhaura station got government help. “We too need chivda (beaten rice), jaggery, tarpaulin sheets, a separate kitchen to feed us,” argues the indignant 12-year-old.

Srikant is grateful for the fact that he learnt swimming young, like most children in the village. So, it’s not the water that scares him, but what comes after. The family owns no TV and he has not been able to follow the classes being telecast by the state government. Recently, the family bought a smart phone, on which they mostly watched YouTube. But it is now dead as the area has had no electricity since August 1.

The Special Project Director of the Bihar Education Project Council, Sanjay Singh, says they are trying their best to reach out to the children. “We telecast a devoted five-day programme for Classes 1 to 12. For rural and flood-hit children, we will start a bridge course once schools open. Children with smart phones can access Mera Mobile, Mera Vidyalaya on the Bihar Unnayan app.”

However, Singh admits, connecting with children who do not have TV sets or mobile phones is “still an area we have to work on”.

The student of a local government school, Srikant is banking on his math tuition, costing Rs 200 per month, to help him catch up. With his notes gone, Srikant hopes he can convince his tutor to refresh some lessons. “I used to be average at math, but after tuitions, I scored 86 (out of 100) in a recent test. I enjoy it now,” he says, adding his mother can’t afford to provide him tuitions in other subjects.

If he studies hard enough though, Srikant hopes to fulfill at least one ambition. “Mud and brick houses fall after floods but concrete houses keep standing. I hope to earn enough to make such a house someday, which is not threatened by floods.”",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDC), in partnership with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), has installed 27 Water Level Sensors in major drains on a pilot basis. The installation of each sensor costs Rs 40,000.These GPRS-enabled andwork with the ultrasonic technology to detect the water level every fifteen minutes. Developed by scientists from the City, the sensors have been installed on drains at flood vulnerable areas. The technology, which is a first-of-its-kind experiment, is expected to help the BruhatMahanagara Palike (BBMP) to prepare the contingency plan well in advance.Some of the places where the sensors are installed are: near Magadi road metro station, Gali Anjaneya temple, Shantinagar bus stand, Mattikere, Horamau, Vasanthnagar, Shivajinagar, Pai Layout, Chikkabasavanapura in Mahadevapura, Kanakanagar, Silk Board Signal, near HAL airport, Doddabidrakallu, Oklipuram, below Domlur flyover, Krishnappa Garden in Tavarekere, Nayandahalli junction, Rose Garden in JP Nagar etc.“The sensor will first alert when the drain fills up at around 50 per cent. Which will give us enough time to keep men and the machinery ready,” a senior BBMP official said. The civic body plans to install similar sensors in around 210 places, he said. The project would cost around Rs 84 lakh.The KSNDMC, which has been working on a flood mitigation plan for the City over the last three years, has identified around 211 flood-prone areas.

This tragic story of Kolleru demonstrates a village’s travails,"What happens during a devastating flood? Not headlines that scream for attention! Empty bellies and starvation in homes that dot many villages remains the stark reality. The horrors of missing children who get swept away in the floods is another facet of the nightmare. While Malgudi was widely known as a fictional setting for RK Narayan’s books, Kolleru is not fictional. It is one of India’s largest freshwater lakes located in Andhra Pradesh. Unlike the quaint charm of Malgudi, the tragic reality is that Kolleru has been one of the most neglected lakes, due to which nearby villages continued having their share of heartwrenching travails.

For those who wonder about why lakes and communities living close to lakes survive during floods year after year, ‘Softly Dies a Lake’ is a must-read literary translation that brings to life all these issues from the perspective of a child named Seenu.

The book tells us how people from villages find ways to survive when floods strike year after year. If one person in the village is in trouble, all are ready to help. The fault lines emerge when people receive no support from those governing them – the administrators who turn a blind eye to villagers and their travails.

Kolleru: History and significance

Kolleru is brought to life in Akkineni Kutumbara’s masterpiece ‘Kolleti Jadalu’ in Telugu. According to the book, the inscriptions of emperor Shalivahana mentioned ‘Kolleru’ for the first time. The great Dandi and the Chinese traveler Huan Tsang made references to Kolleru. Not only did Huan Tsang term Kolleru as a ‘beautiful lake’, he also documented that graded pelicans and flamingos from as far away as Siberia, the Philippines and the Fiji Islands had migrated here, laid eggs, hatched chicks and returned to their lands with their young.

Little tidbits of information make the book quite fascinating. Urban dwellers would probably find eating an octopus ‘exotic’ but in a village, where food is scarce, people make do with the luxury of eating snails or even cranes.

[READ: This debut author brings Kerala’s ancient serpent groves into spotlight]

Eating snails to stay fit and not hungry

You may be shocked that eating snails is not uncommon in villages around Kolleru. Eating snails keeps men and women from putting on weight around the stomach, the book conveys. In fact, snails are eaten by extracting the flesh and throwing away the shells, which do not mingle easily with the mud. Result? Heaps of shells lying around the premises. As a result, it is mostly men who cook as their wives have to go out and sell the fish they catch and bring home.

No caste barriers but village elders reign

Social reforms are inherent in the village way of life even as fault lines exist in the narrative. While the caste system has no rigid sway as villages of both communities share everything without the slightest adherence or interest in preserving caste barriers, there are issues that indicate how village life adopts a closed mindset towards change particularly with regard to its women. However, every problem is addressed by a community of village elders who act as ‘Judges’ and their verdict is final, however unreasonable this may seem.

How the village community utilizes money

Further, money earned from fish auctions are used for the village’s welfare and monitored by a group of nominated village elders who are honest.

Published by Orient BlackSwan, the English translation by veteran feminist rights activist and writer Vasanth Kannabiran brings to the English readers a real-life glimpse of Kolleru and the travails of villagers.

‘Softly Dies a Lake’ can be inevitably linked to India’s ecology mantra – everything is connected – and is undoubtedly a wake up call for lovers of Nature, clean air and literature. Towards the end of the book, a poignant message is delivered, “Today we have given up thinking responsibly or thinking about our villages. We stopped co-existing with Nature and began to destroy it.

182,1260,bangalore,2020,https://citizenmatters.in/preventing-urban-floods-the-real-problem-and-solution-22015,28 Oct 2020,Where’s the roadmap to prevent the next Hyderabad-like flood?,"There can be no dispute over the fact that the frequency, intensity and spread (new cities getting affected) of urban floods is increasing in India. The reasons are mostly known: increasing and mostly unplanned urbanisation, rural-urban migration, encroachments of water bodies, concretization of flood plains and other lands, decreasing capacity to hold, store, recharge and drain the rainwater, increasing rainfall intensities with changing climate, wrong operation of big dams and deteriorating governance.

The damages are going up, also because our forecasts are far from reliable, accurate, location-specific or with sufficient lead time. Because of our incapacity to learn lessons. Disaster preparedness or management is practically non-existent. There is no attempt to even systematically document the phenomena.

In the monsoon of 2020 alone, we saw increasing cases of cities where rivers were running through the streets: Bharuch, Dehradun, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Pune, Solapur to name a few. The trend follows from Ahmedabad, Mumbai in 2005, Surat in 2006, Kolkata in 2007, Hyderabad, Jamshedpur in 2008, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Mahabubnagar, Kurnool and Delhi in 2009, Leh, Guwahati and Delhi in 2010, Haridwar-Rishikesh in 2013, Srinagar in 2014, Chennai in 2015, Patna in 2016, Chennai, Mumbai in 2017, Kochi in 2018, Bangalore, Gurgaon, Kolhapur, Patna, Sangli in 2019 and so on.

One bright spot is that our capacity to rescue and immediate relocation has improved, thanks to NDRF (National Disaster Response Force) and SDRFs (State Disaster Response Force). But 15 years since its formation through a powerful national act, even the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), has not been able to make a major dent here.

The NDMA came out with guidelines for “Management of Urban Flooding” in 2010 and for “Management of Floods” in 2008. The Urban Flood guidelines talk about drainage, master plan, response, even dam operations & mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction in the development process. But we can see little impact on the ground.

Every major urban development project, including townships, industries, roads, bridges, metros etc have an impact on hydrology & flood vulnerability of the city. That means, in order to achieve informed decision making, those at the helm of governance must understand the hydrological impact assessment of every such proposal. Have we seen any such assessment?

Our project approval documents or environment impact assessment reports, which should be having such assessments, mostly remain ritualistic box ticking, cut and paste exercises. The attempt to dilute the norms further under the ongoing draft EIA notification shows the direction in which we are moving.

The Central Water Commission (CWC) is the only flood forecasting organisation of India, but its performance remains pathetic. Incidents from Uttarakhand, Kashmir, North East and Karnataka have time and again highlighted that CWC’s flood forecasting system has been extremely inconsistent. It has failed miserably to raise alerts on time and save human lives and property.

Flood forecasting is such an important activity in flood management. But the NDMA seems afraid to even critique CWC’s pathetic flood forecasting performance, for no known reasons. Most importantly, there has never been an independent assessment of CWC’s work.

Lack of capacity to hold off rainwater

Everyone knows about the Standard Operating Procedures required to deal with floods: adequate drainage; good, advance quantitative precipitation forecasts that will provide estimates of rain water in specific watersheds and sub basins; models that will predict water depths at specific locations; inundation maps; early warning systems; evacuation plans, and a disaster management system that will implement all of this.

But whose baby is all this?

Even when the responsibilities are well defined (e.g. Sardar Sarovar Flood manual for downstream villages and cities), who will ensure that it gets implemented? And what will be the consequences when the actions are not implemented as per plan?

Cities need enough capacity to hold, store, recharge and drain water. Equal to the probable quantitative precipitation (PQP) or probable amount of rainfall in the city catchment area for once-in-fifty-years floods (the highest intensity rainfall in fifty years). If a city does not have that capacity, floods will be unavoidable.

This capacity keeps changing as cities develop. So does the PQP-50, with changing climate. So both Capacity and PQP need continuous recalibration for each city. And depending on the difference between the two for any given city or area, it will need preparedness to face the floods.

In the context of climate change, we need increased capacity since the intensity of rainfall is going up. In coastal areas, high tides will also enter the equation. How many cities have done such an assessment? Possibly none.

In fact, we seem to be continuously decreasing our capacity to hold/ store, recharge or drain the rain water. The new and fast spreading fad of river front development is actually reducing the drainage capacity of the cities. The rivers then will flow in the streets as it happened this monsoon in Jaipur (river front development here has concretised river sides and even beds) and Dehradun (massive encroachment of floodplains and riverbeds).

Cities taking small steps: A few examples

We have a lot of examples that show failures, but far fewer that can be called successes. However, there are elements of successful or notable examples from a number of cities.

For example, the Yamuna Monitoring Committee set up by the National Green Tribunal in Delhi is a remarkable kind of institutional innovation to protect the Yamuna river and its floodplain in Delhi. Recently, the Yamuna Monitoring Committee took quick cognizance and swung into action when certain violations were highlighted by SANDRP in an official complaint. The Committee directed Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to visit the Yamuna floodplain and submit the action reports.

(Action taken by Yamuna Committee on the complaint by SANDRP. Pic: SANDRP)

Bangalore has a number of examples including lake rejuvenation and management in which citizens are majorly involved, the Million Wells initiative that has also started from outside the government.

Vadodara citizens have succeeded in halting the riverfront development in the city.

Pune citizens are raising their voices to abandon the riverfront development for the Mula and Mutha rivers.

Chennai used to be a pioneer in rainwater harvesting till about 15 years ago.

The Delhi government has initiated projects to recharge groundwater using Yamuna floodwaters in floodplains near Palla and also started taking up decentralised Sewage Treatment Plants. But it will still take a lot of doing before we can see a city as an example of ideal water and flood management.

Globally, cities are going towards sponge cities and room for the river concepts. A sponge city is a city structured and designed to absorb and capture rainwater, which will also help reduce floods. Rainwater harvested should be key for such cities. Rainwater harvesting is part of a sustainable system on an urban scale. Room for the River basically ensures that rivers have the necessary space to perform its functions including draining the flood. Buildings and infrastructure are being changed in line with such concepts.

What can ULBs do?

A lot of the disastrous consequences of urban floods can be avoided, reduced. Whose responsibility is it to ensure that? Are there consequences when dams are mismanaged and create avoidable disaster?

There is a lot that Urban Local Bodies can do in this regard. They need to have a living, flood management action plan that gets reviewed every year. They need to set up independent assessment of each flood event to learn necessary lessons, fix accountability.

The ULB needs to coordinate between different departments including those in charge of solid waste management, storm water drains, sewage, industrial effluents and building permissions. There is a need to make necessary changes in master plans, building bylaws and ensure their strict implementation.

Every city needs to have an active flood management group that will constantly monitor the situation and issue necessary alerts, directions and ensure implementation. Possibly, statutorily, the ULB should be made answerable for Urban Flood disasters.

The Government of India has a smart city programme, but the programme does not have an explicit agenda to create ‘flood-smart’ cities — cities that are able to manage heavy rainfall without creating disasters. In fact, the already high water and flood footprint of the cities are growing but they are operating in complete policy vacuum. India urgently needs a National Urban Water Policy that will also provide clearly defined guidelines for urban flood management.

As the Telegraph editorial after the recent Hyderabad floods concluded: “This wilful disregard for public safety can only be attributed to a culture of impunity for the administration. The cost of the absence of accountability is being borne by cities and the people who inhabit them.”

The problem is known, the diagnosis is available, the prescription is also more or less clear. The question is where is the road map to move towards the destination? Till we achieve that, let us be assured that the frequency, intensity and spread of urban flood disasters is only going to increase.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the death toll in Idukki landslide has risen to 15. He said adverse weather condition was slowing down the operations to rescue people affected due to landslide in Rajamala, Idukki. “The state government has sought the help of Air Force but adverse weather condition is not conducive for air lifting people,” Vijayan was quoted as saying.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted saying, “Pained by the loss of lives due to a landslide in Rajamalai, Idukki. In this hour of grief, my thoughts are with the bereaved families. May the injured recover quickly. NDRF and the administration are working on the ground, providing assistance to the affected.”

Union Home Minister Amit Shah said that he had spoken to DG NDRF. “Their (NDRF) team has reached the spot to provide all possible assistance to the administration with the rescue work. May injured recover soon,” the home minister was quoted as saying. Earlier, Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has lauded the dedication of rescue teams at Rajamala, Idukki, where landslide claimed 14 lives and rendered many people missing.

Heavy rainfall, landslides, overflowing river and lakes, and flood-like situation have battered parts of Karnataka. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has sounded a Red Alert in seven districts and forecast predicts rainfall for the next four days due to low-pressure formation. Waterlogged roads, flooded coronavirus COVID19 treatment centers have hit Mumbai very badly. High-speed winds between 70 kilometers per hour to 100 kilometres per hour have led to the fall of over 360 trees. IMD has predicted heavy rainfall likely to occur at isolated places in the Western Madhya Pradesh.

Hyderabad’s recent floods are but one example.

The southern Indian city of Hyderabad is reeling under its worst floods in over a century. Since the second week of October it has been lashed by heavy and incessant rain, which has put vast swathes of the city under water.

Rainfall has been unprecedented. On October 13, Hyderabad is estimated to have received around 192 millimeters of rain, with some areas in the city like Himayat Nagar and Charminar receiving 298.8 mm and 245 mm respectively that day. The amount of rain the city received over a 24-hour period on October 13 exceeded what it typically receives over a month in October.

Extreme weather events like the Hyderabad rains are evident across India and growing in frequency. On July 2, Mumbai witnessed the second heaviest rainfall in a single day over the past 44 years, the highest being July 26, 2005 when the city received 944 mm in 24 hours. In 2015, Chennai received 490 mm of rain in 24 hours, the highest in a century.

Even such copious rainfall wouldn’t have led to the kind of flooding that India’s cities are witnessing had their drainage systems been functioning. Sadly, natural and man-made drainage systems that would have helped drain off excess water have been undermined over the decades and particularly so in recent years. Unplanned urban development, encroachment of lakes, and construction of buildings on reclaimed water bodies are preventing the natural run-off of water.

A 400-year-old city, Hyderabad sits on the banks of the Musi River. Hundreds of small man-made lakes, all linking up with the Musi and its tributaries, were constructed over the centuries and following the floods of 1908, two large artificial lakes, Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar, were added to the intricate network constructed to regulate the flow of water into the Musi.

Over the past century, Hyderabad has grown enormously. Unchecked encroachment of lakes and building construction on reclaimed land and river embankments have eaten into waterways, causing them to overflow during downpours. Low-lying areas and reclaimed land go under water quickly.

Hyderabad is located in an arid region. As activist Lubna Sarawath has observed “rains should have been a blessing, but now they’re a nightmare.”

Whether it is Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, or Mumbai, waterways and canals that would have drained off water have vanished and in their place shopping malls, apartment complexes, and even airports have come up. Chennai international airport’s runways are built over the usually dry Adyar River. When water in the Chembarambakkam reservoir was released during the downpour in December 2015, it rushed through its natural waterway to the sea – the Adyar. But with the river blocked, the water flooded Chennai’s tarmac and soon the airport was engulfed in water.

In the name of infrastructure development, Mumbai’s mangrove forests, which are its natural defenses against floods, are being cleared to make way for high-rise buildings and freight corridors. But mangroves absorb excess water and the building constructions are blocking rainwater from flowing freely to the sea. This is among the main reasons for the annual flooding that Mumbai experiences.

Aggravating the problem of flooding are old urban drainage systems. Mumbai’s is over a century old. According to a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Mumbai’s drains “are heavily silted and punctured at many places.” They have the capacity to take on 25 mm of rainfall per hour but during the monsoon, rainfall often exceeds 50 mm per hour.

Civic authorities do not prioritize improving the capacity of these drains. Meanwhile poor waste management and sewage systems are adding to the pressure. Dumping of construction debris in drains is rampant, causing the clogging of stormwater drains and sewage pipes. It results in sewage pipes throwing up fecal and other waste onto roads and into homes.

Consequently, urban flooding is usually followed by a spurt in cases of cholera and gastroenteritis. India is already struggling under the pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic. Flood-related epidemics loom too.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

On Wednesday, large parts of south Mumbai were inundated after the island city reported its heaviest single-day downpour in August in 46 years with 293.8 mm of rainfall.

“The island city’s drainage system is 140 years old, designed by the British. At that time, most of the island city was green. The drainage system was designed considering that 50 per cent of rainwater will be going through drains and the rest will percolate into the ground water. Now very few parts in south Mumbai are open but the underground drainage system has remained the same,” environmentalist Debi Goenka said.

The amount of rain that Mumbai experiences has remained unchanged over the last 80 years. The old drainage system, along with Mumbai’s then abundant open spaces, allowed the percolation of water and its faster dispersal. The gradual concretisation of open spaces has meant that the percolation of water does not happen the way it used to be.

On Wednesday, many areas in south Mumbai, which usually do not see waterlogging, were flooded for hours. According to the India Meteorological Department, in nine hours, its Colaba observatory recorded 225 mm of rainfall. The last time the area had seen heavier rain than Wednesday’s was in 1974.

Areas like Churchgate, Marine Drive, Fort, Girgaum, Khetwadi, Walkeshwar Road, J J Marg, Gol Deol, Bhendi Bazaar, Kalbadevi were flooded and water entered several houses.

Urban planner and executive director of Urban Design Research Institute (UDRI), Pankaj Joshi, said that the city needs to change its planning in view of climate change. “Some are still denying climate change. This phenomenon of heavy rains in a few hours is happening frequently. Our storm water drain network can drain out 25 mm to 50 mm per hour but draining 280 mm is virtually impossible. You need to be prepared and to quickly understand that our city needs to be engineered. Now, we should look for preventing disaster rather than management,”said Joshi.

He pointed out that BMC’s BRIMSTOWAD (Brihanmumbai Storm Water Drain System) project has been going on for 13 years. It comprised 58 works, including rehabilitation and augmentation of underground drains, widening and deepening of nullahs and construction of pumping stations. After spending Rs 1,200 crore so far, the civic body has only completed 38 works.

According to BMC data, the island city has the highest population density with around 46,000 people living in 1 sq km as against the city’s average of 29,000 in per sq km. The island city is spread over 68.71 sq km with a population of 31.58 lakh and being the oldest part of the city, has hardly any place to develop further.

Environmental activists, however, pointed out that the construction of the coastal road as well as the Metro, which have been going on for the last few years, have accelerated south Mumbai’s urban infrastructure woes.

“The problem is accentuated because of the combination of reclamation and construction. During such projects, the barriers set up, construction materials and debris may clog the drainage system. The more hard-paved barriers you create, the more water tends to run off. Some of these situations are unavoidable but then you should have the right drainage channel to reduce waterlogging,” said Hussain Indorewala, professor in Kamala Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute of Architecture in Mumbai.

In the past, BMC has sent written to the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited on Metro 3 (Colaba-Seepz) work clogging and damaging drains.

The BMC, meanwhile, believes that what happened on Wednesday was a weather anomaly and the flooding was the result of heavy rains that the area experienced in a short period of time.

“Coastal road project contractors have taken all precautions for discharge of drain water. At one place near Nair hospital, there was some clogging of drains due to their work but that has also been cleared by them. Heavy rainfall in a very short time is the reason behind flooding in these areas,” said an official from BMC’s storm water drainage department.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Night-long heavy rains not only inundated low-lying areas in Bengaluru on Wednesday, October 21, but also caused huge property loss in the city.

A huge retention wall constructed across the stormwater drain in Gurudatt Layout of Rajatrajeshwari Nagar has washed away, a senior BBMP official told reporters.

According to the BBMP, Bengaluru received more than 75 mm rainfall, which caused huge damage to property. ""We have not estimated losses yet, as zonal officers were busy in clearing waterlogging as well as in rescue operations,"" the official said.

Jarakabande forest

Deputy Conservator of Forests says a strict ‘no’ to’s plan to eat up 25 acres offor 65-km Peripheral Ring Road projectNorth Bengaluru, infamous for its depleted groundwater table, was all set to lose a major chunk of a notified forest land. The 65-km peripheral ring road (PRR), being executed by the Bengaluru Development Authority (BDA), would have bisected the 703-acre Jarakabande Kaval nearinto two and taken away about 25 acres of forest land. About two km of the PRR project -- proposed right in the middle of the forest – would have brought down at least 631 trees and also sliced through a lake. As compensation, the BDA had offered to provide around 35 acres of land near the Bannerghatta reserve forest.But thanks to the Deputy Conservator of Forests, Bengaluru Urban division, that plan is history now. Alarmed by the planned destruction of the forest land, the DCF gave a clear ‘no’ to the BDA and directed the authority to file a fresh proposal with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change under the Forest Conservation Act 1980.“We are filing a fresh proposal for seeking forest clearance. Simultaneously, the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board () is finalizing the environment impact assessment report. We did our best to minimize acquisition of forest land while preparing the road alignment. The project requires very little forest land,” BDA Commissionertold Bangalore Mirror.As per the original plan, the 25 acres of forest land is part of the 1,800 acres required for the implementation of the PRR project, which passes mostly through agricultural land. The eight-lane corridor will also come in the way of 33,838 trees including 9,304 trees in TG Halli catchment.This is, however, not the first time that northern Bengaluru is witnessing loss of forest land or being eyed by authorities intent on bringing ‘progress’ to Bengaluru. About 471 acres of Peenya plantations were given to HMT industry and the defence; a residential layout has come up on the 285-acre Mallathahalli reserve forest. Bangalore University,campus and Veterinary college stand on forest land too.“Unlike the south, North Bengaluru has very few forest lands including Jarakabande, Marasandra and Machohalli. Around 68 acres of Machohalli forest was given to 33 religious institutions recently. A road through Jarakabande would fragment the habitat. It is also going to be a loss of lung space,” a senior forest official said.Environmentalistsaid the authorities should stop acquiring forest land or axing trees by rerouting the road alignment. “The government should create sustainable cities. Where will one get water, milk and food if authorities keep asphalting the city and its outskirts? An environment impact assessment should study the spillover effect,” he said.Retired(IFS) officer BK Singh said most compensatory measures proposed in exchange of getting forest land have failed. “The forest land provides ecological services such as controlling floods, soil and water conservation.

Heavy rains that continued in Bengaluru for the past few years resulted in the city's iconic Sankey Tank getting filled to the brim and beginning to overflow for the first time in 12 years.

Deputy Chief Minister Ashwathnarayan CN, who also represents the Malleswaram constituency, visited the Tank on Thursday to offer 'bagina' on Thursday. He cited the reason behind the tank overflowing was due to the steps taken to ensure that water falling into the catchment area reaches the tank. ""Measures were taken to desilt the canals that lead to the tank. This action along with abundant rains has helped the tank accumulate so much water,"" he said.

He added that soak pits will be built and the water-filling capacity of tanks across the city would be enhanced soon to avoid wastage of rainwater.

A division bench of Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Avinash Gharote on Friday issued notices and gave six weeks to various state and central authorities to file their response.

Petitioners Manik Chaudhari (53), from Nilaj (Panchgaon) village, and Manohar Naktode (55), from Udapur village – both in Brahmapuri tahsil of Chandrapur district – have claimed that the government did not alert Vidarbha villages and towns before the floods caused by the release of water from a dam (in Madhya Pradesh) between August 28 and 30. They also claimed that the government did not provide prompt relief and rescue during and after the disaster.

They alleged that the compensation offered was far less than the actual damage suffered by them.

The petitioners, represented by lawyers Kalyan Kumar and Anand Deshpande, said that the provisions of Disaster Management Act and state and district disaster management plans were not adhered to during the entire period of floods and thereafter.

According to the petitioners, no chain of commands was followed to reach the warning of floods to the affected areas in time. “There were no heavy rains in the affected districts of Vidarbha, Nagpur, Bhandara-Gondiya, Gadchiroli and Chandrapur. The floods were caused by the release of water from a dam in Madhya Pradesh. When the neighboring state was receiving heavy rains, a chain of commands should have been followed to inform the affected parts of Vidarbha. But the local authorities said they had received no such alert from the Madhya Pradesh side. The responsibility must be fixed for this lapse,” argued Kalyan Kumar, seeking a judicial inquiry.

“The inquiry should also look into the discrimination meted out to Vidarbha in the quantum of compensation,” Kumar said.

The petitioners claimed that compensation for the flood-affected in Konkan was announced without any cabinet meeting while the one for Vidarbha came after five cabinet meetings.

“The compensation offered to us was pittance,” petitioners argued. Chaudhari claimed that he has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 95,000 in crop damage and his 2.25 acre land was covered with sediments brought in by flood waters. He also claimed to have lost 30 water pipes in the flood. He added that he was given an initial compensation of Rs 13,600 per hectare as against Rs 18,000 per ha announced by the Minister for Relief and Rehabilitation. He added that he was promised another Rs 12,000 for the loss.

Naktode, who lost his mud house, claimed that he along with his wife and daughter were living in a shed provided by a fellow villager. He added that his entire paddy crop on three acres was swept away in floods. He said he has received Rs 10,000 as gratuity and was promised Rs 6,000 for “partial damage” to house and Rs 17,000 for crop loss, terming the dole as “meagre”. He has demanded compensation meant for full damage to house and has claimed that his crop loss was worth Rs 90,000.

The region, known as Kerala’s granary and for its famed backwater tourism, is now moving to houses on stilts. And people who cannot afford such a house have done truss work on the roof so that they can remain safe in the event of a flood. Truss work is an extra roofing over the terrace, usually in a triangular shape, making the terrace a covered, usable space — at a height.

“We are not new to rising waters, but the 2018 flood had made us think of ways to remain afloat,” Vettikkattuchira Muraleedharan, an auto-rickshaw driver who constructed a house on stilts, or pillars, last year, said. “All our belongings were destroyed as water gushed into homes. Aged parents could not be rescued on time…we were neck-deep in water inside.”

His wife Sathiyamma, a literacy prerak (motivator), said they could not think of a new house in the mainland due to the soaring real estate market. “So we decided to construct a new one on pillars at the same plot after living in a temporary shed. Now, we are much above the level the water had risen in 2018,’’ she said.

The Kuttanad region, also spread over parts of Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts, is 2.2 m below sea level, with houses perched precariously on narrow strips of lands sandwiched between paddy fields and backwaters. Monsoon after monsoon, the 80 or so villages, with vast paddy fields, face the fury of water gushing in from the eastern hills and towns of central Kerala. In the aftermath of the 2018 flood, Kuttanad remained submerged for several days.

If only a handful of the rich had experimented with houses on stilts in the past, the trend has caught on over the last two years in the region.

Kainakari panchayat president Panakkalchira Sheela said, “All houses in the panchayats that are either constructed or are under construction after 2018 floods are on pillars. Nearly 350 such houses are already under various stages of construction.” Sheela pointed out that the authorities did not ask people to build such houses. “The experience (of the floods) made them fight back in their own way. Many others have gone for truss work. This leaves space on on the terrace, so that they can stay safe even if the house gets submerged,” she said.

Beena Vinod, a panchayat member who is constructing a house on pillars, said, “Many families initially considered leaving the region. But that is not easy for people like us who are mainly dependent on cultivation and fishing in backwaters. We want to continue living here,” she said.

The trend is now more visible at Kainakarai, Chambakkulam, Nedumudi and Veliyandu panchayats, where hundreds of houses are coming up on pillars.

192,1270,bangalore,2020,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-hyderabad-floods-2020-lakes-6821184/,21 Oct 2020,"Explained: Why the 2,800 lakes in Hyderabad could not prevent a flood this year","The man-made Hussainsagar lake was Hyderabad’s main drinking water source till the early part of the last century. But even as the city, established by Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah of the Qutb Shahi dynasty in 1591, expanded beyond the fortified walls of the Golconda, the heart-shape lake built across a tributary of the river Musi, was only one of the several hundreds of lakes that dotted the region.

In less than a century, the city has expanded from 55 sq.km to 625 sq.km under the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). The jurisdiction of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) spreads over 7,257 sq.km covering parts of a few neighbouring districts as well, and had 2,800 lakes as per as 2017 estimate.

The water bodies were created for drinking water and irrigation purposes at a time when water management was considered crucial in this otherwise arid region for centuries. This network of man-made water bodies, interconnected by several natural waterways, ultimately led to the River Musi in most cases. Along with these small lakes, in the aftermath of the 1908 floods in Hyderabad, the Nizam government commissioned two big reservoirs, Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar, on the periphery of the city to regulate the water flow from Musi and its tributary Esa.

But the rivers have since vanished. Discharge of sewage and industrial effluents, encroachments by government and private individuals, and decades of neglect had everyone thinking the river would never flow again. Most of the former waterways are open sewers now. But, on October 13, the river was in spate once again after a record downpour. Low-lying localities and colonies that were built on the lake beds and nullahs were submerged in no time. Many days later, hundreds of these colonies were still under water.

Between the Krishna and the Godavari

Based on hydrology, present-day Hyderabad can be divided into Krishna and Godavari basins. Traditionally, all the rainwater falling in the catchment areas of Musi would discharge into Musi which is one of the 22 tributaries of the Krishna river. And newer localities to the west of Hyderabad, including Gachibowli and the IT corridor, are all in the catchment areas of the Godavari.

In both Krishna and Godavari basins, the city has a network of lakes and drains which carry the excess water from one to another and then finally into the Musi and Majeera rivers.

Senior Hydrogeologist BV Subba Rao says lakes were built in the past based on the natural topography and rainfall trends. “These were not created for flood control mitigation but as draught mitigation structures. Every 2 sq.km had a lake to ensure water for drinking and irrigation purposes to every habitation. Flood regulation was only one of the purposes,” he explains.📣 Follow Express Explained on Telegram

The forgotten lakes

Over the years, owing to the expansion of the city, the lakes were not in demand for their primary purposes of irrigation and drinking water. But they continued to be relevant for flood regulation.

Despite this, in the last few decades, several colonies, as well as large real estate ventures, have come up in the full-tank levels — the buffer area — of lakes, large water bodies that existed for centuries have shrunk in size, encroachments have eaten into natural waterways, and stormwater drains get easily clogged.

As per the GHMC data, parts of the Nadeem Colony abutting Shah Hatim Talab had water rise to 12 feet after the downpour on October 13. Devi Nagar and Chudi Bazaar colonies in Goshamahal saw the water rise to 10 feet. Similar were the scenes in several other colonies like Hafiz Baba Nagar, Al Jubail Colony, Ghazi-e-millat colony, Chandrayangutta, Ghouse Nagar, Moin Bagh, Edi Bazaar, Talab Katta and Riyasat Nagar in the old city area. All these localities witnessed water rise to 4 feet. Close to two dozen colonies around LB Nagar too faced a similar fate.

As many as 33 lives have been lost to heavy rains and floods in the city, with the GHMC estimating that at least 37,409 families have been affected. The Municipal Administration minister pegged the city’s losses at Rs 670 crore.

As of July 31, 108 blocks in 14 districts are affected. According to our estimates, that means over 39 lakh people are affected. One of the main issues is two to three breaches on the Gandak and a couple on Budhi Gandak river. About 72 hours before heavy rain, we send an alert to the district. In Bihar, people live inside embankments too. So if there is an alert, our engineers are made aware, and people are asked to move from the embankments. Following the July 9-11 heavy rainfall, and again on July 19-21, there was a heavy rain alert in the Gandak catchment of Nepal, and the concentration of rain was above 200 mm at several gauge stations. In hundreds of places, our engineers have continued working on seepage and piping day and night.

What is the forecast for the near future and what are your preparations?

In the last 24 hours, while Gandak has been stabilising; Budhi Gandak and Adhwara group rivers have received a lot of discharge from Nepal and levels show a rising trend. In two to three days we expect rain to subside in the Gandak, Budhi Gandak, and at Baghmati, Adhwara and Mahananda catchments. Water levels of Gandak, Budhi Gandak, Adhwara group rivers and Mahananda have set new records this July… breaking those set in the 1987. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has been especially concerned about ensuring that people living inside embankments move out in time. In his daily stocktaking briefings, he seeks to know not only about rainfall, river trends, forecasts and flood-fighting efforts, but also the relief and rescue efforts.

Bihar’s floods are almost an annual ritual. How has Covid-19 affected operations this year?

We had a lockdown from March 24, and that was the peak time for the department to do anti-erosion work. No trucks could come. No labour or engineer could go to the site. After April 10 or 12, the CM exempted this work from the lockdown. But that was not enough. We made a cell that contractors could contact if they had issues with material, so we could contact the factory outside the state, or the district collector concerned, and get the truck moving. Only then were we able to finish 393 critical anti-erosion work, which was difficult. Engineers also tested positive. We are sending people from headquarters, but they are not familiar with the terrain. These are not ordinary times, even for flood work.

A month ago you said there were issues with maintenance work on the Gandak barrage on the Nepal side. What is the status on that?

This becomes a country-to-country thing. MEA deals with them. Our representative also sits in Kathmandu. There have been some issues relating to work this time. Here, it is our government, and we did the work accordingly. But we do flood fighting and anti-erosion work in Nepal side also. There was a lockdown there, and we had no access. So we requested the MEA. I said that even if we fix everything, what will happen if things go wrong upstream. But they stopped our engineers. They said they would let them go only after thermal screening. Later, they agreed they could go. I don’t want to speak on India-Nepal relations, but things were not as smooth this year.

The opposition says that amid flood and Covid, CM Nitish Kumar is not stepping out and is focused only on elections. What is your response?

From day one Nitish Kumar has been monitoring, reviewing every day. The number of migrants who came was not small, 30-40 lakh. I think he managed it well. Quarantine centres were opened. I travelled with him in June by road to Darbhanga and Madhubani, to review work on the India-Nepal border. He has seen other points of the flood situation. It is true that if the CM moves too much, the administration of different regions gets affected. As far as elections is concerned, it is for the Election Commission to decide. As far as my party is concerned, JDU is for the election. Why people are running away from elections, I don’t know. Because they have seen the Lok Sabha results and they were wiped out. They have seen their future.

But if the Covid curve is high, or amid floods, how will an election happen without say rallies, or people coming to vote?

We have time. Let’s see how things unfold in August. EC has come out with details like increasing booths, etc. Let them take a call. We hope things improve in Bihar. Death rates are minimal, recovery rates are more than national average. Things are not as bad as projected.

HAM operators in the past have provided communication support during the Odisha super cyclone, Gujarat earthquake, tsunami, Uttarakhand floods and the Chennai floods. More recently, they were also providing support to the covid warriors in the city.Smriti and Prama trained at the Bengaluru-based Indian Institute of Hams to become the youngest female licenced amateur radio operators.“For the last two years, I have been closely following my father operating and communicating with HAM radios. I was fascinated by the way it works and decided to apply for the course and become a qualified HAM operator. After I got my licence I have been regularly communicating with the HAM community,” said Smrithi.Prama, a student of Excel Public School in Mysuru, said that said she took to HAM as a hobby and would come to Bengaluru during the weekends for her training course. She is happy to have cracked the ASOC in her very first attempt.S Sathyapal, director, Indian Institute of HAMS said, “They were among 46 other candidates who successfully cleared the exam to become HAM operators.”Smrithi, a student of National Center for Excellence, said that she was introduced to the HAM operations and its uses by her father who is a licenced operator. She wanted to become a qualified operator once she was of eligible age.In future, both the girls want to uses their HAM radio licence to help during disasters. “One of our instructors shared his experience about the Gujarat Earthquake relief operations and how HAMs were used as a second line of communication,” said Smrithi.Prama said that she would like to make use of her HAM expertise during big events. ‘I would like to use my skills during the next Mysore Dasara,” said Prama.When asked to describe how communication over HAM radio differs from the new-age social media communication, they said, “Unlike social media, here the mode of communication is different. Also here, we interact with a certain group of people who are qualified in HAM radio operations. They all have to pass an exam. There is a screening process before they are allowed to operate HAMs. Social media is for all.”In India there two licence categories - one is General and the other Restricted.

On Monday, an order was issued regarding the establishment of the Strategic Nala Development Programme (SNDP) and appointing Dr. C Vasantha, retired chief engineer of Roads and Buildings department, to head the new wing as the Officer on Special Duty (OSD) for a year.

According to the government order, the project wing will study the existing Nala (nullah) or stormwater drainage system across the city and identify critical narrow points, encroachments on its path, and also related issues, and submit reports to take up all works in a mission mode.

As a specialized wing in the GHMC, the state government has decided that the SNDP will work in coordination with other line departments while working under the control of the GHMC commissioner. Based on field requirements, the SNDP is allowed to induct officials from the Irrigation department and other field experts. And the policies, programmes, and activities of this new wing will be subjected to frequent review at a higher level, it said.

Following the floods, the GHMC had plugged the immediate damages to roads, drainage, and nullahs at Rs 670 cr.

A similar special inspection that was taken up by 15 Flood Management Groups on 192 tanks (lakes and ponds) across Greater Hyderabad soon after the floods have called for emergency works to the tune of Rs 9.8 cr and permanent works to the tune of Rs 31.64 cr in these tanks.

The teams were formed to take up precautionary measures to protect the lakes and ponds in Greater Hyderabad and assess the damages or breaches that had occurred due to heavy rains.

(Representational)

There is currently no threat of a breach at a lake in China which has caused flash floods downstream in Himachal Pradesh in the past, scientists monitoring the situation said.

A breach of Parechu lake, a depression along the Parechu river in the Tibetan Himalayas, which filled up after a landslide dammed the river, caused flash floods in the Sutlej basin in Himachal in 2005. Ever since India has been monitoring water levels of the lake through satellite imagery during summer and monsoon to stay prepared in case of a repeat of the tragedy.

In 2013, water accumulation in the lake had increased after the inflow of water exceeded the outflow, causing an alarm in Himachal, but there was no breach. Officials said the water spread of the lake has been stable for the past several years, and according to a report by the state centre on climate change, last year’s satellite data showed slight accumulation in the lake but a normal flow of water.

Dr S S Randhawa, principal scientific officer at the centre, said that this year’s satellite data is currently being received from the National Remote Sensing Agency in Hyderabad, and is yet to be analysed. Alternatively, water levels along the Sutlej are also monitored by the Central Water Commission. An official from the commission said that the lake has mostly been “lying dormant” since it burst in 2005, and poses no threat as of now.

The Parechu river enters Himachal from the east near Kaurik in Spiti, and soon joins the Spiti river flowing from the west. From here, the Parechu-Spiti tributary flows southward for around 50 km before joining the Sutlej which enters Himachal from China near the Shipki La pass in Kinnaur.

The CWC monitors the Sutlej water levels in Kinnaur and also receives upstream data from Zhada in China, an official said, adding that the concerned authorities in China have been cooperative in sharing this data.

2005 flood washed away roads, bridges

The flash flood in 2005 had claimed no human life, but caused property damage to the tune of Rs 610 crore, according to the state disaster management authority. It washed away 10 bridges, 11 ropeways, and parts of the old Hindustan Tibet road, including a 10-km stretch between Wangtoo and Samdo. It also damaged link roads and other motorable and foot bridges.

The region also witnessed similar flash floods back in 1975, when an earthquake created a blockage on the Parechu River between Kaurik and Sumdo. It led to the formation of a temporary lake which burst two months later causing floods in the area.

Recipe for disaster

Climate change-induced glacial lakes are forming rapidly in the Western Himalayas, posing great danger to downstream areas, according to a recent study by the state centre on climate change. It said that the extent of a majority of glaciers is changing rapidly, leading to an “alarming increase” in the formation of moraine dammed lakes. When such a lake bursts, consequences down the stream can be disastrous.

Researchers were able to map 562 glacial lakes in the Sutlej basin, 242 in the Chenab basin, 93 in the Beas basin and 38 lakes in the Ravi basin.",The study said that the number of lakes in the Sutlej basin has increased from 400 in 2000 to 562 in 2018.,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

By Bejoy SebastianScores of kids studying in a private English medium school were stuck aton Thursday. The underpass, which gets submerged during every rainy season, has been impacted badly after the recent rainfall. The school bus was finally rescued when the Fire and Emergency Services Department, responding to the SOS call, came and pumped out the water. The panic stricken children could finally heave a sigh of relief when the bus moved.For thousands of residents staying near Doddanekkundi, this underpass is the key road that connects them from their area to the Outer Ring Road, so that they can avoid the always-congested Marathahalli Road.,“In the past, there was only a drain under the railway line and this underpass was constructed much later. This underpass is the only way to reach Doddanekundi village from the Outer Ring Road. About 15,000 – 20,000 people pass through it every day. The BBMP is only providing temporary solutions whereas we need a permanent one.BWSSB has just created a temporary pipeline, connecting the drainage system below. But this is not a sustainable solution. None of this seems to be working there,” says Clement Jayakumar, a commuter and member of Whitefield Rising, a citizen engagement platform.According to Prof. Ashish Verma of the Transportation Engineering Lab, IISc, there are multiple reasons including poor planning and poor drainage facilities. “Some areas could be low-lying. Authorities should constantly update their flood-maps and take prompt steps to deal with flooding. The drainage system of the city is not perfect. There are no proper spillways in most of the underpasses for the rainwater to drain. All this contributes to flooding,” he said. He also added that the Bengaluru Metropolitan Region flood map is prepared based on the heavy rainfall that occurred on 3 November 2015 and it is overlaid over the BMR road network to extract the flood water.The city has about 180-200 km length of primary and secondary storm water drainage systems and nothing was added in the Business as Usual (BAU) model. Due to the flooding of roads, people who commute in their usual paths change their course which leads to longer distance and travel time.”When contacted, the local Corporator, Shwetha HR said that she has requested the BWSSB to construct storm water drains. “The current pipeline is not effective enough to curb floods.

The authorities had initially planned to open the highway on Sunday, when rain eased up and water levels receded.

But when police checked a stretch near Shirol at Kolhapur, one of the many flooded spots in the district, they found that it was still unfit for traffic.

On three points between Karad and Kolhapur, the water levels had crossed the danger mark. Police issued an advisory, asking people not to travel on the highway and, in case they were already on the highway, to stop before Kolhapur. Thousands of heavy vehicles were stopped on the service road before the closure points, about 15,000 of which came up on the highway in six days.

Tirupati Kakde, Kolhapur district’s additional superintendent of police, said, “After an assessment on Monday morning by all the agencies involved, the highway was finally opened for trucks carrying fuel, medicines, milk, vegetables and other essential supplies for flood-hit areas. The water level at some points on the road was still over one foot, but it had started receding.”

Sanjay Shinde, resident district collector of Kolhapur, said, “On Monday afternoon. we started allowing trucks, which were stopped on the highway, to ply, and later cars were also allowed. But we are still not allowing two-wheelers on the highway… we may allow them from Tuesday.”

Nagasandra residents wake up in the middle of the night as lake breach floods housesSeveral homes around, near Nagasandra were flooded afteron Wednesday night as thewas breached after heavy inflow of water into the lake. Many parts of northwere affected.It is said that the lake bund was weakened after pipelines were laid by theWater Supply and Sewerage Board () to carry sewage water to the nearby(STP). “The lake bund breached because it was very weak. The Bangalore Development Authority () has not handed over the lake to us, with all the necessary documents, till date. The state government had directed it to do so in 2017,” said Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike () deputy conservator of forests (lakes) Jagannath Rao.According to a BBMP official, the BWSSB authorities have not taken measures to strengthen the lake bund after laying the pipeline. “The BWSSB is responsible for the breach of the lake bund. Even the BDA is responsible as it has delayed in handing over the lake’s authority to the BBMP,” said the official on condition of anonymity.Mayor Gowtham Kumar and BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar and other officials have visited the affected areas. Some of the residents have expressed their anger against the Mayor while a few of them even argued with him with claims that the BBMP has been neglecting the area.The Mayor and the BBMP commissioner pacified the agitated residents and assured them that the lake bund will be strengthened immediately. “The lake’s authority was handed over to the BBMP recently. So it is our duty to reconstruct the damaged lake bund,” said Anil Kumar.BBMP chief engineer (lakes) Mohan Krishna said that Rs 6-7 crore is needed to strengthen the lake bund and remove the silt from the water body.The residents were seen removing water from their homes and looking at the damaged electronic and electrical appliances with dismay. “I am struggling to cope with this inconvenience. Our TV, refrigerator and two bikes have been damaged due to water-logging,” said D Varalakshmi, a home-maker.Trying desperately to recover from the shock, Sridhar S, a resident of Bhavani Nagar, said that he woke up at 1.30 am and saw the shed where he had been sleeping was full of water. “I have to sleep in a makeshift shed as my house is undergoing renovations. I was sleeping on a cot. I was shocked to see water rising up to the level of the cot. I have lost 25 bags of cement and a truck load of sand that I had bought for the construction of my house,” added Sridhar.Most of the roads at the newly developed layouts were full of slush. A few children were seen taking selfies on the roads inundated with lake water.“My bike has been damaged due to water-logging. My neighbour moved his family members to the rooftop to ensure their safety,” said Darshan J, another resident.Meanwhile, Doddabidarakallu ward corporator Vasudeva S said that no deaths were reported. “More than 40 houses were flooded with the lake water. Around 50 two-wheelers and 20 cars were damaged,” said Vasudeva.The BBMP commissioner has directed the BBMP engineers to file a case against DM Santosh of Belmara Layout for constructing a bridge across a storm water drain without permission.

These two traffic policemen had to get their hands dirty when choked drains clogged the main thoroughfare in KR Puram on Thursday

By Y Maheswara ReddyPlastic, thermocol and waste dumped in drains turned Thursday’s showers into a nightmare for commuters. Imagine the situation when the rains arrive next monthBe careful what you wish for, because you just might get it all. From the lips of a few lakhto God’s ears, their requests for respite from this prevailing un-Bengalurean weather were finally heard. But the joy at the sight of dark clouds, heavy with the promise of rain turned quickly into dismay as rain fell and quickly turned the city’s roads into dark, grey rivers. Streams of rainwater slowed down vehicles, causing traffic jams. Trees came uprooted and crashed down, killing one person. Transformers burst and several parts of the city reported power outages for nearly six to eight hours. Commuters were taken by surprise and stranded on their way home and’s already-under-pressure infrastructure caved in.The dry spell for a few months had made us forget the havoc rains had caused last year, as(SWDs) overflowed, flooding low-lying areas of the city causing large-scale destruction in their wake.For a city that’s not at sea-level, Bengaluru has always suffered from flooding during the rains. The State has allocated Rs 42 cr for desilting 842 kms of SWDs, of which 440 km of desilting has been completed, says Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad. And yet, the unexpected rains caught everyone, including the, offguard.When heavy rains lashed Bengaluru on Wednesday and Thursday evening, many parts of the city got flooded. One of them, a stretch on Old Madras Road near Benniganahalli, was particularly bad. Vehicular movement on the stretch came to a standstill. Traffic police struggled to restore the flow of vehicular traffic which had been thrown awry due to the rains and flooding. A few traffic police constables were seen using lathis to clear the silt that blocked grates over roadside drains.Parts of Airport Road and Outer Ring Road were also flooded, affecting traffic. Though the onset of the monsoon is more than a month away, it seems the BBMP authorities are yet to achieve any degree of monsoon preparedness.The sorry state of the city crumbling under the weight of two summer showers invited sharp criticism from citizens and civic activists.“I am not happy with the road infrastructure in the city. The road design is not right. The BBMP authorities indulge in piecemeal dredging whenever the roads are flooded with rainwater. They do it without removing the silt in the culverts. There is no preparation to avoid flooding in monsoon,” says Kathyayini Chamaraj, Executive Trustee, CIVIC.The other reason for flooding is choking of roadside drains with debris and silt. The BBMP spends crores of rupees to remove silt from roadside drains but the silt remains and as usual flooding of roads takes place during the monsoon season.According to V Ravichandar, a civic expert, the big crisis to hit Bengaluru is urban flooding. The reasons for this are many - poor lake holding capacity, unstilted drains, construction in low-lying areas, encroachments over storm water drains, break in inter-linked lakes that existed earlier, etc. “The low-lying areas of South and East Bengaluru are at a greater risk during heavy rains and cloud bursts due to the ridge-like nature of Bengaluru. The downstream lakes are mainly in the south/southeast areas. Further, with concrete drain lining and lakes being bypassed through drains, water tends to rush to the lower areas much faster than it should, leading to flooding,’’ explains Ravichandar.BBMP Joint Commissioner (Mahadevapura Zone) Jagadeesh N S said that he had already instructed the chief engineer to look into the matter. “I have been transferred to another zone. A new Joint Commissioner will assume office soon,’’ said Jagadeesh. Meanwhile, BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said that the BBMP has taken up desilting of storm water drains to avoid inundation of low-lying areas in the city during monsoon.“We have completed desilting of 440 kms of storm water drains out of 840 kms, much before the onset of the monsoon. We will complete the pending work soon,’’ says Manjunatha Prasad.The BBMP Commissioner has said that BBMP engineers have identified the areas that are vulnerable to flooding during monsoon. “For the first time in the history of BBMP, measures have been taken to maintain storm water drains throughout the year,’’ the Commissioner said.According to the BBMP Commissioner, one reason for the flooding on Old Madras Road which led to traffic snarls, was because the drains have a certain capacity to carry rainwater to the nearest lake and “whenever the city receives a sudden downpour, it will take some time for the rainwater to drain out from the roads.’’Patience, is what the BBMP commissioner asks of the Bengalurean, but that’s wearing thin after memories of last year’s rain havoc.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown

Bangalore: In the wee hours of October 10, 2019, residents of Bhavani Nagar, Rukmini Nagar, Anandappa Layout, and Muneshwara Layout were stranded when sewage flooded 500 houses. This was because of heavy rains which caused Doddabidarakallu lake's corner bund to give way. In areas surrounding the lake, water levels reached as high as five to six feet which affected more than 100 families and submerged 300 vehicles.

Panic-gripped residents alerted BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) officials and police officers. While some of them were using buckets to drain water from inside their houses, others climbed up to their roofs to save themselves from the rising water. Residents of Rukmini Nagar, a street alongside a sewerage leading to the lake, were helpless to tackle this flash flood as they hustled to save their loved ones and belongings. Vijayamma, an area resident said: ""Sewage was pouring into the house from every outlet, including the kitchen sink. I was standing on my half-submerged bed waiting for the water levels to come down.""

Shocked

Prakash, another resident of Rukmini Nagar said, "" When I walked out to see what the commotion was, I was shocked that there was water till my hips. The water was mixed with sewage and garbage, but everyone had to walk through it to grab their belongings.""

The lake which is spread across 40 acres was filled to the brim and heavy rains that night caused the breach of the lake bund.

According to the local people, this is not the first time that Doddabidarakallu lake has overflowed in this manner. Venkateshamma, a daily-wage employee said: "" Every monsoon, there are floods, that is why I don't own a TV set, fridge, or anything expensive because it will get ruined. But this is the first time a flash flood has happened, and I was in my hometown when it happened. When I came back, the water had ruined my store of rice, wheat, and ragi. I am now dependent on the relief fund which the government has promised us.""

Relief

Ramakrishna, Revenue Inspector of BBMP, HMT Layout, said that relief funds were being allocated for affected residents based on the State Disaster Relief Fund Act. He also said, ""We have initiated the process of providing relief material to 100 families already. Distribution is taking time because we have to verify the genuinely affected residents from the fake ones.”

A man-made disaster?

Officials at the BBMP office stated that many houses in the flood-affected areas have been built on or located next to 'Raja Kaluves'. (Raja kaluves are stormwater drains built to channel rainwater from various parts of the city directly into lakes.) Now, with houses being built over them rainwater cannot freely flow into the lakes. Hence, when there is heavy rain, the water flows into the sewerage (and nearby areas) causing the overflow.

As part of precautionary measures, BBMP officials have formally sent a complaint about illegal encroachments. Krishnappa, an assistant engineer at the corporation office, said, “ We have informed the ‘Raja Kaluve Vibhagha’, Jayanagar. They will soon survey the area for houses built 30ft. from the drains and take immediate action against the owners.”

The houses on illegal property are owned by people living in different parts of the city. According to officials, these ‘owners’ then rent out the houses for meagre amounts to those who cannot afford better housing. So, the question is, who are the real victims here?",flood,Doddabidarakallu Lake Flood,"Bangalore, India","October 10, 2019","October 11, 2019","['Bhavani Nagar', 'Rukmini Nagar', 'Anandappa Layout', 'Muneshwara Layout']",100 mm,"500 houses flooded, 300 vehicles submerged",0,"loss of property, livelihoods, and disruption of daily life",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The state government, however, had requested for Rs. 3,000 crore. The recent floods in Karnataka are touted to have caused losses to the tune of Rs. 50,000 crore and around 103 taluks in 22 districts have been badly hit with over 6.9 lakh hectares of crop loss. Around 75,317 houses have been damaged due to the rains. But so far, the state has only got help by way of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Air Force and Army assistance during heavy rains, landslides and flooding. The New Indian Express had reported that the state government had decided to shell out Rs 1,500 crore from its own pocket.

This devastating flood has affected the whole state, particularly North Karnataka very badly. However, a natural disaster of this scale went unattended by the central government for two long months. Earlier in August, the Chief Minister of Karnataka, B S Yeddyurappa had met 60 private companies and requested them to fund the flood relief efforts of the government. He had offered them, as Livemint reported, to rename the villages by the names of the companies that would fund that village. This desperation could have been shown to and used to pressurise the central government to release funds. Even when the state government did approach the Centre, the funds were not released immediately.

Also read: Karnataka Government Forced to Shell Out its Own Money as Flood Relief

There seems to be an interesting reason behind the state government’s initial reluctance to pressurise the Centre for immediate disbursal of flood relief fund. The Bharatiya Janata Party is the ruling party at both the Centre and state. Recently, Tejasvi Surya, a young MP from South Bangalore issued a statement saying that the state has enough funds to fend for itself and there was no need to ask the central government for funds. It is a belief among the BJP leaders and supporters that the central government is too busy and shouldn’t be disturbed by matters like job loss, mob lynchings, hate crimes and even natural disasters.

Earlier, Karnataka had declared 156 out of 176 taluks as drought hit. The then Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) coalition-led state government headed by H D Kumaraswamy had submitted a memorandum, seeking Rs 2,064.30 crore as drought relief fund for the rabi season as crop loss was estimated to be Rs 11,384.7 crore. Kumaraswamy had also told the PM that the state was finding the amount allocated from the Centre for the drought during Kharif season insufficient. As NewsClick has reported earlier, the state received less funds under the rural jobs scheme, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and the then state government had to spend on its own. Now, the government has allocated a meagre amount of Rs 1,209.39 crore for drought, and Rs 1,200 crore for floods. So, now with the state government being forced to spend money from its own pockets, it is all the same.

Kerala, a state in the southwest, flooded devastatingly in 2018, but saw its wells run dry soon after.

Chennai, a growing south-Indian metropolis, was inundated by rains in 2015—but this summer, waiting for the monsoon, its 11 million residents have watched three of its four reservoirs run dry. Meanwhile, across India, the groundwater that provides an invaluable buffer between monsoons is severely depleted and in danger of being irreversibly lost.

Welcome to the new India: hot and desiccated and wet and flooded, all at once, with the fates of 1.3 billion people and rich biodiversity hotspots riding upon increasingly unpredictable rains.

The southwest monsoon, which usually drenches India from June to September, has come ten days late this year, bringing 30 percent less rain than normal for the month of June. In the north, Delhi has thus far seen almost no rain, while in southern India reservoir levels in southern India are running dangerously low. Headlines in newspapers scream “zero-day” and “running dry” and “historic drought.”

Chennai, a megacity now dependent on tanker trucks, leads the grim news. But Bangalore, India’s answer to Silicon Valley, is not far behind. There are murmurs that this burgeoning, bulging city will have used all its groundwater by 2020.

The dire predicaments of these two urban areas is a cautionary tale—a symptom of the larger malaise that plagues water management in a country that is soon to be the most populous on Earth.

Buy me a river

Bangalore sits smack in the center of the lower half of the Indian peninsula, about 3,000 feet above sea level. A city of 12 million, one of the fastest growing in the world, it contributes $110 billion to India’s GDP. “Bangalore deserves to be water-secure,” says S. Vishwanath, director of Biome Environmental Solutions, a local design firm.

Yet Bangalore has no perennial water source of its own. It has to pump water nearly 90 miles and up nearly 900 feet from the Cauvery, a sacred river that flows south of the city.

The city draws 1450 million liters per day (MLD), about 385 million gallons, from the Cauvery, with withdrawals slated to go up by 775 MLD (210 million gallons) in a couple of years, when new pipes will be laid. Still, the water does not reach everybody.

“Bangalore’s water woes are not as much a problem of supply, as it is of distribution,” Vishwanath says.

A quarter of Bangalore’s population, living mostly on its periphery, is not connected to the river water supply and is forced to mine groundwater to survive. This area of the city, replete with tech parks, is where most of the growth is.

Rampant groundwater extraction, unmonitored and unregulated, has caused Bangalore’s water table to plunge to depths of nearly 1,000 feet. Muddy and contaminated, the diminished resource threatens the future of the citizens who depend upon it.

Since in some places the groundwater is now below the level of the river itself, the river has begun to feed the groundwater. The Cauvery is thus being sucked dry from two sides—by the giant pipes that pump water into the city and by the bore wells that drive deeper each year, lowering the water table to levels below that of the river and forcing the river to feed it.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Unreliable supply

Here’s what’s most unsettling: Bangalore’s current water distribution problems could evolve into a fundamental crisis of supply, because flows in the life-giving Cauvery are no longer secure.

Climate models predict a 5 percent increase in the river’s flow due to rising temperatures, which should bring more evaporation and heavier rains. However, that is not what recent trends in the basin show. Instead, dry season flows from the upstream regions of the river have been declining.

“These models don’t seem to be able to explain the recent past,” says hydrologist Veena Srinivasan, Fellow at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore. The problem, she says, is that the models are not yet powerful and sophisticated enough to incorporate the effects on climate and weather of local changes in the landscape.

There have been plenty of changes. In the catchment regions of the Cauvery, widespread clear-cutting of forests to make way for transmission lines, coffee and palm-oil plantations, and other cash crops has affected the soil’s ability to retain and release water.

Research has also shown that large-scale deforestation affects South Asia’s monsoon, depressing precipitation levels—because fewer trees means fewer leaves transpiring water back to the atmosphere, resulting in warmer and drier conditions.

According to a study done by Coffee Agroforestry Network (CAFNET), this region has seen a decrease of 14 rainy days a year over the past three to four decades. Moreover, agricultural land-use has also changed near the river, with traditional paddy-fields giving way to coffee plantations. Paddy, with its requirement for standing water, meant that the fields traditionally acted as a spongesa sponge. Coffee and palm-oil plantations, in contrast, require heavy irrigation and see significant run-off.

“We don’t seem to be connecting the dots,” says Harini Nagendra, professor of sustainability at Azim Premji University in Bangalore. “Instead of trying to get more water into the Cauvery, we are investing time in fighting over its dwindling resources.”

If the Cauvery is dwindling, and groundwater is near exhausted, what options does Bangalore have?

First, catch the rain

Bangalore gets between 800 and 900 millimeters (32-36 inches) of rain in a year, which is hardly a meager amount. If the city were to catch half of that, it would translate to more than 100 liters (27 gallons) per capita per day, far more than adequate for domestic and drinking purposes. Rainwater harvesting has been slow to catch on in the city, in spite of laws requiring it, but it’s now steadily picking up.

The next step would be to funnel some of the harvested rain via “recharge wells” back into groundwater, to begin to restore it. Two Bangalore NGOs, Biome Environmental Trust and Friends of Lakes, have launched a citizens’ initiative to dig a million recharge wells in the city—that’s about one every 90 feet. The idea is that these wells will pump back 60 percent of the rainwater into the shallow aquifer that has been depleted by overuse—and by the fact that only around 10 percent of rainwater currently can seep through cracks and gaps in the city’s pavement.

A local community of well-diggers called the mannu-vaddars man the effort. Using hand toolstools, they dig 30-to-40-foot-deep open wells that strike the shallow aquifer. Once it has been recharged the wells themselves become sustainable and cheap water source.

Vishwanath has other plans for recharging groundwater. Bangalore returns about 80 percent of its water to rural areas in the form of wastewater that flows in seasonal streams and rivers. Much of it is untreated—putrid, dark, and thick with sewage and hazardous heavy metals.

“Waste treatment plants are being put in place to treat 1440 MLD,” says Vishwanath. Once that begins to function, ‘fit for purpose’ water, cleaned of heavy metals but still rich in nutrients like phosphorus, will be returned to rural areas for use in agriculture. Vishwanath’s idea is to treat some of the wastewater further, to render it potable, and use that to recharge groundwater.

There is one gaping hole in the hopeful vision evoked by these ideas: India’s woeful lack of the institutions and governance needed to oversee such efforts and manage the water supply soundly, according to rules that are enforced.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

In Bangalore, the governmental department that oversees groundwater extraction has just six employees, and thus no earthly way to monitor and enforce the law in this sprawling city. One digger of illegal borewells freely admitted to me that he had paid a bribe to get a permit for a deep well—after he had already dug it.

At the larger river-basin level, there are no institutions in place to manage water resources at all.

“We are all fixated on technological solutions to the water crisis,” Vishwanath laments. “What we really need are robust institutions and governance at the river basin level so that we can understand what is happening to land-use change, sand-mining, forest cover, and groundwater extraction—all of which affects river flows.”

Without strong government involvement, known solutions to India’s water crisis won’t be implemented at a large enough scale to affect the bigger picture. Chennai is a case in point.

Chennai’s fossil water addiction

With a GDP of $78 billion, home to 40 percent of India’s automobile industry, Chennai has boxed itself into a corner as far as water resources go. Located on the east coast, it gets two-thirds of its rains from the northeast monsoon that arrives in November and December and only a third from the southwest monsoon—the one that this year has been less than enthusiastic.

The city depends on four small municipal reservoirs; it doesn’t have access to larger reservoirs, shared with agriculture, that it can borrow water from in a drought. Moreover, these four reservoirs service only 35 percent of the city’s water needs. Seven of 11 million people in Chennai depend upon fossil groundwater, w accessed either by privately dug borewells or by tank trucks that bring water in from distant borewells. The tankers are controlled by powerful water-mafias.

“The state [controlling only 35 percent of the water supply] becomes the minority, and its influence gets subverted as private [tanker] interests have captured value addition in water. They run it like a business,” says Vishwanath. The water mafias are well-connected to politicians, bureaucrats, and the police, making them difficult to dislodge. With taps running dry, voices are getting shrill and the government, as a band-aid measure, has set aside ten million dollars for a 50-wagon train to ferry 10 million liters (about 3 million gallons) of water every day from the Cauvery to Chennai.

Chennai, like many cities in India, has built over its wetlands. The pavement prevents groundwater from being recharged during rainy months—and instead causes low-lying areas to flood.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

“The increasingly short attention span of policy makers, decision makers, the media, and even of citizens is frightening,” Nagendra says. “We focus on drought issues in the summer, and forget them once the monsoon strikes. We then focus on the challenges of too much water via flooding, and again forget this when the summer hits. Ironically the causes are much the same for both drought and floods—loss of wetlands, cutting of trees, building over lakes, rivers and interconnecting channels. But no one seems to make the link.”

The problem is nationwide; Chennai and Bangalore are just the leading edge. “The real crisis will come in the smaller cities and towns that are now fast urbanizing,” Nagendra says. “And the real hope of doing something may also lie there, as many of these areas have not yet faced ecosystem degradation and collapse at the scale that megacities have.”

Srinivasan is optimistic even for the degraded megacities.

“In a city with urban sprawl, the water problem is eminently solvable,” she says. “You build out your infrastructure for rainwater harvesting, you recharge the aquifers with treated wastewater, and make sure paving has enough give for rainwater to seep through.”

If India can just build the institutions to do all that, there will indeed be hope.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

It was thanks to upgrades, in fact, that these vehicles could drive through the flooded streets in Kerela to provide support.

The unfortunate events during Kerela floods saw an incredible display of people coming together to help each other out. One of these came off a number SUV owners who rescued people from flood-stricken areas and ferried supplies. There was, in fact, also an announcement from the state government in which its requested 4X4 vehicle owners to step forth and assist with the situation at hand. Now though, those very SUVs and off-roaders are in trouble with RTO because they are modified to perform better off the road.

A recent government order has banned all sorts of modifications to cars and motorcycles alike. A number of SUV owners in Kerela are upset with the decision and have now written an open letter to the CM, reminding him of the assistance those modified vehicles provided in an hour of need.

In the open letter to Chief Minister of Kerala Pinarayi Vijayanarar posted on Facebook, Tisson Tharappel writes that the owners of the “so-called” modified vehicles in Kerela volunteered willfully to assist during the floods. All their vehicles are ready to face emergency situations like those during the recent floods, he added.

Tharappel pointed out that such modifications are legal in developed countries, adding that the government must be lenient with such modifications without penalising the 4×4 vehicles. “It is painful to forget that many jeep owners in Kerala used their vehicles for rescue during the floods.”

Kerela’s off-roading community has insisted the government revisit the current rule on car modifications and not include their SUVs in the category and instead consider them upgraded vehicles. They have urged the government to set up a committee to study the vehicles and suggest new norms.

Modified Cars, Bikes are illegal says Supreme Court! Not even paint, exhausts

Many of these SUVs in Kerela have raised suspension, are fitted with snorkels for deep water wading and other such upgrades. It was thanks to upgrades, in fact, that these vehicles could drive through the flooded streets in Kerela to provide support. The community was also facilitated by the State Chief Secretary for their efforts and gathered a lot of appreciation across the state and country.

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court clarified that no type of modification that alters any specification made by the manufacturer or to what is mentioned on the vehicle registration certificate will be legal. Modified vehicles are so far not being fined or challaned but the police and RTO are expected to begin a crackdown on car and bike modifications soon.",solution,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","August 8, 2018","August 21, 2018",['Kerala'],"['1144 mm in 24 hours at Aluva', '2572 mm in 48 hours at Cheruthoni', '2361 mm in 24 hours at Kothamangalam', '2304 mm in 24 hours at Kozhikode', '2133 mm in 24 hours at Ponmudi', '1972 mm in 24 hours at Peermade', '1841 mm in 24 hours at Kalpetta', '1765 mm in 24 hours at Munnar', '1708 mm in 24 hours at Thiruvananthapuram', '1680 mm in 24 hours at Idukki']","['10.07 lakh houses damaged', '80,000 km of roads damaged', '1,53,334 hectares of crops damaged', '103 bridges damaged', '1,24,447 people evacuated', '483 people killed', '14.5 lakh people affected']",,"[""Kerala's economy suffered a loss of Rs 20,000 crore"", '10 lakh people were displaced from their homes', '1000 schools and colleges were closed', '1000 villages were cut off from the rest of the state', '1000 km of roads were damaged', '100 bridges were damaged', '100000 people were evacuated', '483 people were killed']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Residents say repeated communications with Bruhatand Mahanagara Palike () andWater Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) have shown no progress in the area. Roads in Doddakammanahalli, Noble Residency Layout and Begur Koppa are in poor condition since two years now. They were dug up and left without being repaired after the Cauvery water connection work was undertaken by BWSSB. During monsoons, the low lying areas have flooded due to poor construction. The dug up stretch has also developed plenty of potholes due to which two-wheelers, especially, are at risk.K Prakash, president, Beautiful Begur federation says, “The roads in Begur have been dug up by the BWSSB for the Cauvery water pipeline work and has been abandoned after that since the past two years. The entire stretch floods during rains and is uneven and dusty during summers. The dust pollution has been affecting the elderly and the children. We have not even received a glass of Cauvery water to drink even though the work has been done. We are being denied basic amenities like water and roads.

A meteorological unpredictability is looming large over South India and it’s more visible in Kerala and environmental hotspots like Nilgiris and Coorg.

The state is facing the combined after effects of climate change, population pressure and unscientific land utilization.

In Kerala, it looks like climate-change-induced floods are becoming an annual affair. Following heavy rains over the last one week, the state which once boasted consistent rains during the monsoon season is now grappling with devastating floods in the month of August. It was so in 2018, and it is not any different this year too. It continued to pour till Sunday (11th August) evening, and then in isolated showers with decreasing intensity.

The death toll has gone up to a frightening 92, and 58 others are reported missing — feared trapped under mud and debris — at Kavalappara in Malappuram district and Puthumala in Wayanad district, where massive landslides have wiped out hundreds of houses, places of worship and other buildings. As many as 250,638 people are displaced due to the rains with many living in 1326 relief camps, while alert was sounded in 13 of the state’s 14 districts.

Rivers are overflowing and many low-lying areas have been inundated. In most parts of the state, heavy rains and road blockades are hampering rescue operations; and in many regions in the northern districts of Wayanad, Palakkad, Malappuram and Kannur, vehicles and buildings remain half buried in flood waters.

Like in the previous year, in the initial days of the southwest monsoon in Kerala, rainfall was scanty, and it remained so till nearly the end of July, raising disturbing questions about the availability of water for domestic and agricultural purposes. There were reports from various regions of the state about shortage of potable water and it being supplied through tanker lorries.

Read Southwest monsoon plays truant in Kerala.

An anniversary run?

It however, began to pour as the first anniversary of the devastating floods of 2018, which had physically subdued God’s Own Country, approached. Unabated rains are now bursting the banks of the major rivers in the state, forcing authorities to open the shutters of some of the big dams such as Banasura Sagar in Wayanad.

Sekhar Kuriakose, member secretary, Kerala State Disaster Management Authority said that the floods of 2018 were of an unprecedented nature and what is now happening is a repetition. The mood, character and form of rains have changed in the last two years, he said. Across the state, landslides are happening one after another, causing death and destruction in their wake.

According to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, eight districts in the state witnessed 80 landslides between Friday and Sunday. Most of the deaths were caused by landslides and in most places they wiped away large portions of hill areas. Landslides even affected the Cholanaika tribe who live in the deep interiors of Nilambur forests in Malappuram district.

The situation in the state once again pointed to the absence of a scientific flood and disaster management system. The official measures taken since the deluge last August have obviously failed to prevent the loss of human lives and livelihood. The state also has the dubious legacy of promoting encroachments of water bodies, rivers, forests and ecologically fragile lands. Though the government has been vocal about the construction of flood-resilient buildings for quite some time now, over 3,000 houses have already been damaged in the floods this year.

Unpredictability looms large

“The monsoon over Kerala has completely lost its traditional character,” said Gopakumar Cholayil, consultant climatologist and research officer at the Academy of Climate Change Education and Research, Kerala Agriculture University.

“A meteorological unpredictability is looming large over the entire south India and it is more visible in Kerala and environmental hotspots such as the Nilgiris and Kodagu. Global warming is the main culprit, and in all likelihood, the floods will be followed by a severe drought,” said Cholayil, who has been researching on the changing rain patterns of the region for the last 20 years. Topographical changes induced by adverse changes in land use patterns are a contributing factor, he adds.

S. Faizi, a member of the Biodiversity Convention’s Expert Group on Poverty and Biodiversity and president of the Ethological Society of India said that the problem with Kerala society is its refusal to accept the reality.

“There is a wide segment of experts and opinion makers who believe deforestation and change in land use patterns are the reasons for the devastating floods, which are now becoming an annual affair. They cite ecologist Madhav Gadgil’s studies on Western Ghats to validate their point. In my opinion, these are just contributing factors. Those people who focus too much on the contributing factors are ignoring the real villain. We lack climate literacy and there is an urgent need to study the impact of global warming and climate change on Kerala,” he said.

Venu G. Nair, a meteorologist at Centre for Earth Research and Environment Management said that experts have been predicting the possible shift in the character of the monsoon since the 1960s. However, alarming changes have started occurring only in the last couple of years. Still, nobody expected a sequel to the Kerala floods of 2018.

“After the floods last year that affected all the districts of Kerala except Kasaragod, the state government and its research agencies had asserted that there would not be a repeat of the disaster in our lifetime. They termed it as a once-in-a-century phenomenon. Nobody raised the issue of climate change in the debates that followed the deluge last year,” recalled N. Badusha of Wayanad Environmental Protection Organisation.

In the previous year, there were allegations of the meteorological department not informing the state government in advance about the volume of rainfall. It has been claimed that it was because of this that the government had delayed the opening of the shutters of different dams in the state. This time, most of the dams remain half empty even as flash floods are causing landslips in areas far away from dams and rivers.

The enormous amount of damages that have occurred in Wayanad, Nilambur, Attappady, Nelliyampathy and Idukki are pointers to the fact that the highly sensitive Western Ghats region is facing the brunt of global climatic change. This area is now facing long spells of both droughts and floods.

“The monsoon calendar has changed. Rains played hide and seek in June and July, the normal monsoon months. But the quantum of rain that lashed Kerala in three days of the first week of August, was equal to what the state had received during more than a month in the past,” said Cholayil.

“I too have been involved in the various agitations that took place in the recent past demanding protection to Kerala’s forests, hills and wetlands. There is a need to maintain them for the future generations. But there is a large number of so-called experts and opinion makers who are part of the climate change denial lobby which is very powerful,” Faizi said.

“Several climate experts had predicted that floods would recur in a five-year interval instead of the historical 100 years. But in Kerala, it is occurring for the second consecutive year. Those who try to shift attention from the devastation caused by global warming and its causative agents by blaming imagined forest loss seem to be pushing a corporate agenda. When the rains that you normally get in two months of monsoon pour down in one or two days what occurs is flood, deluge — the extreme climatic events,” he added.

According to Kusala Rajendran, professor at the Centre for Earth Sciences at Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, the changes in land use patterns in Kerala have made the after effects of climate change more complex. The changes in agricultural patterns, land use and the ongoing building construction spree need to be studied authentically, she said.

“Climate change is a reality and it must be taken seriously. Kerala is in fact facing the combined after effects of climate change, population pressure and unscientific land utilisation, she added.

Experts are suggesting the need for large scale planning and research to minimise flood-related damages in the future. Policy level changes are required for management and distribution of resources. On its part, the government has already started issuing stop memos to granite quarries in the environmentally fragile zones and denying permission for buildings in vulnerable regions.

It’s mainly because of drastic change in rainfall distribution,” said GS Srinivas Reddy, director, KSNDMC.While most districts of north Karnataka and south- interior Karnataka faced drought in 2018, Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts and parts of Shivamogga were hit by floods and incessant rain. In fact, Kodagu and parts of Chikkamagaluru bore the brunt of rain fury.Reddy said drought and floods were occurring not because there’s a drastic decline or increase in rainfall. As per analysis of data since 1991, there’s been an average decline of just 2.5mm of rain during the southwest monsoon and 4.2mm in the northeast monsoon. A 4mm decrease in rain is equal to loss of 1 tmcft of water, which is insignificant compared to the state’s annual rain yield.In a year, Karnataka receives 1,135mm of rain and the south-west monsoon accounts for 73% of it. Since 2011, the state has received an average rainfall of 1,033 mm, that’s 10% less than normal.Even north-interior Karnataka received good rainfall with an average of 593mm against the annual rainfall of 712mm.It shows that distribution of rainfall, not quantity, is the problem. In 2015, the state received good rainfall in April and early May facilitating good sowing. But rain stayed away in July and August when it was needed the most.

Water began receding from the surroundings of Hulimavu lake off Bannerghatta Road on Monday a day after a breach in the bund resulted in flooding in Krishna Layout, DLF Road, Saraswathipura, Avani Sringeri Nagar, Royal Residency Layout and BTM Layout 4th stage.

Residents and authorities are taking stock of the damage. More than a thousand people were affected and over 800 houses were inundated with the water level reaching a height of 4 feet in some places.

Families were seen picking up pieces of their lives in an attempt to restore to normalcy even as authorities were busy pumping out water from homes, basements of apartments and commercial establishments. Cars and vehicles submerged under water in flooded basements were towed out.

‘Focus is on apartments’

“Civic officials ensured that water receded, but have left behind roads filled with slush for us to clean. Most of the pumps are deployed at apartments and not at our homes,” said Gowramma, a resident of Krishna Layout.

“We have been cleaning the house for the past eight hours, but it is of no use,” said Gayatri Baliga, a resident of 2nd Cross road, Royal Residence Layout.

Neither power nor water supply in the affected areas have been restored. With stormwater drains (SWD) overflowing sewage, the water sumps were left unusable. Sump cleaning teams did brisk business in the area on Monday.

There was palpable anger at the poor response of government agencies.

‘Where are the water tankers?’

“Although we've heard of water tankers being provided by BWSSB, none has reached the inner, more severely affected areas,” said Radhika Balaji, a resident of 3rd cross road, Krishna Layout.

Sajith S. Nair, a resident of Royal Residency Layout, alleged it took almost four hours for help to reach them on Sunday.

""In order to prevent water from entering the house, we blocked the door with a cot, but our efforts were in vain. The water burst into the house and we had to save our belongings. But all our electronic appliances, like refrigerators and air coolers, are damaged,” said Poornima Karthik, a resident of Krishna layout.

Fever and body ache

A mobile hospital deployed by BBMP at Krishna Layout, which was one of the worst affected neighbourhoods, recorded over 70 patients, including children, who were suffering from fever, vomiting and and body ache.

“My 13-year-old son, Yogesh, has come down with fever. Many children have taken ill. I hope it is not dengue or anything serious. I have sent him to the relief camp with a relative, so he can stay in a dry place,” said Manjula, a resident of Krishna Layout.

US agency hired to study city floods (2005 to 2015) submits reportThe report also says this about’s planners – “major infrastructure development rarely takes into account the level of hazard.”(Doesn’t this apply to the ongoing debate around cutting Aarey trees?)Mumbai lost Rs 14,000 crore between 2005 and 2015 to fl oods caused by heavy rains, a report by the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and top accounting fi rmhas revealed.The floods also left 3000 people dead during this period, including over a thousand who perished in the July 26, 2005 deluge when the city received 944 mm of rain in 24 hours, a 100-year high, the report says.This is the first time a figure has been put to the devastation that Mumbai suffers every year in the rainy season. While USTDA and KPMG focused on 2005 to 2015, the city has been brought to a complete halt multiple times in every rainy season since.This year already, rains have brought Mumbai to its kneesJust last week, the Mithi in spate combined with high tide, leading to massive flooding. Even Western Railway tracks went under water, a first in many years. Worst, however, was reserved for, where there was waist-deep water and 1500 people from Krantinagar had to be evacuated. The study, instituted by the Relief and Rehabilitation Department of the state government in March 2019, interestingly, observes that “major infrastructure development rarely takes into account the level of hazard.”This is exactly what environmentalists have been shouting hoarse over as they oppose the state government’s decision to build a car shed for Metro 3 line at Aarey Colony. The car shed will not only lead to felling of over 2700 fully grown trees, the concretisation of the area, which currently acts as a holding pond during heavy rains, will increase the water flow into the Mithi, leading to floods worse than witnessed last week. The report also says that “vulnerable areas prone to disasters are not being identified.”The report titled ‘Flood Management and Vulnerability Assessment tofor’ was submitted to the government last month.It suggests that an integrated platform be developed to share and analyse information collected from various sources. The report says that some tools like “drones, satellite images and emergency mobile apps” can be used to get early alerts.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Women who lost everything turn entrepreneurs to rebuild lives from scratchAfter the recent floods wreaked havoc, Kodagu is in the process of rebuilding itself. While help poured in from all quarters soon after the tragedy, a few like-minded organisations have decided to stay back and continue their support and help people rebuild their lives.Among these, theis leading from the front. Balaji Kashyap, secretary, Kodagu Kendra, told BM, “On August 14, amid incessant rain for weeks, the earth beneath Kodagu shuddered. These were no earthquakes, but landslides. Massive portions of hills on which lives and livelihoods were built came crashing down, destroying everything on its path. People lost their homes, estates, valuable properties, documents, cattle, pets and some even their lives. In the wake of this disaster, a few residents with the help of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan decided to come together and join hands in tackling the aftermath.”Relief andwas launched at Kalur, located 17 km away from Madikeri.“It was one of the most affected areas. Being a predominantly agricultural society, the community suffered due to the destruction of the estates and farms, leaving many women and men without a source of income. ‘’ is about rebuilding lives. The victims, till the disaster struck, were leading a decent normal life. We launched Yashaswi, a programme targeting women to find alternate source of income through skill development and entrepreneurship,” he said. Experts from Rural Development & Self Employment Training Institute (RUDSETI) trained women in culinary and tailoring. About 66 women are part of Yashaswi Programme of which 47 are in the tailoring class. “We have begun receiving orders for products made by them, allowing them to explore entrepreneurial avenues through the label of Yashaswi.Culinary classes have helped women consolidate their traditional knowledge and recipes and to present to the market a variety of products under the label Coorg Flavours which is available on popular shopping websites as well as in the website called coorgflavours.in,” he said. The first outlet was opened near the tourist hub Raja Seat on Saturday.Now, to ensure consistent support, as the programme is in its initial stages and financial support is needed for women, they are looking out for an entrepreneur buddy.“We are not looking at the beneficiaries as victims but they are budding entrepreneurs. There is a need to buy a vehicle (Tata Ace), so that they can sell their products across and outside the district in different fairs and tourists spots. In addition, we are also providing a stipend of Rs 3,000 a month to each woman entrepreneur. The team now wants a buddy to sponsor a woman for six months till they fully establish themselves. While about 40 women are already being sponsored, the rest are hoping that buddies will come forward to support them,” he added.Through Yashaswi, experts from Rural Development & Self Employment Training Institute (RUDSETI) trained women in culinary and tailoring.

BENGALURU/HUBBALLI: After 500 tourists stranded at Virupapura Gadde (island) near World Heritage Site Hampi were rescued, the Karnataka government has initiated legal action against owners of hotels and resorts on the island for ignoring the flood warning.“We’ll initiate action against owners of hotels and guest houses for putting the lives of guests at a risk,” said Koppal deputy commissioner C Sunil Kumar.He’s also contemplating recovering fees paid to NDRF teams from erring hoteliers. According to sources, a platoon of NDRF team is paid Rs 40,000 per day.The hoteliers reportedly misled authorities on number of tourists stuck on the island. “They said there are around 200 tourists, including four or five foreigners. But there were over 450 tourists,” Sunil Kumar said. The administration vacated the entire island, including hoteliers and staff.There are 16 authorised hotels on the island, including some illegal ones. Fearing losses, hoteliers had ignored the warning issued by the district administration and didn’t ask guests to leave.About 544 tourists, including 27 foreigners, were stranded after flash floods triggered from Tungabhadra entered the island in Koppal district, about 350km from Bengaluru.The administration had issued an alert on Saturday anticipating heavy discharge into the river from TB Dam in Hospet following heavy rain in Shivamogga district. But hoteliers neglected the alert and reportedly persuaded tourists to stay put, assuring them they would be taken to safer places in case there were floods.“Since it was a weekend, they didn’t want to lose business. They were aware that floods would come when they admitted tourists into the island which is a grave mistake,” the DC said. The NDRF and other rescue teams had to brave inclement weather and swelling Tungabhadra river for two days to rescue tourists. Five rescuers even had a miraculous escape when their boat capsized and were swept away in the river.Life in historical Hampi town returned to normalcy on Tuesday with flood water receding to a great extent. The water level in Tungabhadra, which was in spate on Monday, also receded.

Villages in Punjab’s border district Ferozepur face an imminent flood threat after a major portion of an embankment in the catchment area of the Sutlej river was washed away on Sunday following the release of water by Pakistan into the Indian territory.

Following the development, Punjab government officials said that the Ferozepur district administration is on high alert. Precautionary deployment of the NDRF and the Army teams has been made in view of threat which looms large in some villages.

“Pakistan has released water in huge quantity which caused damage to the embankment in Tendiwala village, and there is danger of floods in some villages,” a spokesperson of the Punjab government was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.

“Being on guard, the district administration has announced evacuation in most sensitive villages along the Sutlej river as a precautionary step besides deploying various teams of the health department, food and civil supplies department and others,” he said.

He also urged people not to panic saying that the administration is geared up for the task with relief work at vulnerable points being undertaken at a fast pace.

Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has asked the Water Resources Department to work out a joint action plan with the Army to strengthen the embankment at the village on the Indo-Pak border.

While presiding over a high-level meet to review the flood situation in the state, Singh directed officials to ensure that the Tendiwala embankment on war footing is strengthened in order to avert flooding in nearby villages, an official statement said. The Punjab Chief Minister has also directed the Ferozepur deputy commissioner to keep NDRF teams on standby to meet any emergency situation.

The state government had on Wednesday announced a package of flood compensation with an immediate financial aid of up to Rs 10,000 each to all calamity-hit families.

Relief and rescue teams continued search operation in at Kavalappara in Malappuram and Puthumala in Wayanad, where a series of landslides had wiped out two villages last week.

The southern state has been battered by torrential rains for the second consecutive year leading to heavy floods. Experts are attributing the recurrent flood situation to climate change. “The intensity of rainfall has been high. It is more common nowadays, and we can attribute it to climate change. In the coming years as well, we can expect high-intensity rainfall,” an IMD official said.

The state had initially witnessed a major rain deficiency and was on the cusp of drought when heavy rains returned to create havoc. A weak El Nino along with an inadequate strengthening of southwesterly winds was seen as the reasons for the deficient rainfall. But within a week, on August 10, the rainfall deficiency had dropped to just 8%, as the state was pounded by heavy rain over a few days.",flood,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","August 8, 2019","August 15, 2019",['Kerala'],"['104 people lost their lives across the state in floods and landslides', '11,901 houses have been partially damaged and 1115 fully damaged']","['1,75,373 still sheltered in 1,057 relief camps']",['104'],"['Relief and rescue teams continued search operation in at Kavalappara in Malappuram and Puthumala in Wayanad, where a series of landslides had wiped out two villages last week']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

245,1323,bangalore,2019,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/25/climate/india-monsoon-drought.html,25 Nov 2019,"India’s Ominous Future: Too Little Water, or Far Too Much","For a country that relies on rain for the vast share of its water, that combination is potentially ruinous.

At the same time, the dry spells between storms have gotten longer. Showers that reliably penetrate the soil are less common.

Throughout India, the number of days with very heavy rains has increased over the last century.

The monsoon is central to Indian life and lore. It turns up in ancient Sanskrit poetry and in Bollywood films. It shapes the fortunes of millions of farmers who rely on the rains to nourish their fields. It governs what you eat. It even has its own music.

Monsoon rainwater and the swollen Mithi River flooded parts of Mumbai in August.

Climate change is now messing with the monsoon, making seasonal rains more intense and less predictable. Worse, decades of short-sighted government policies are leaving millions of Indians defenseless in the age of climate disruptions – especially the poor.

After years of drought, a struggling farmer named Fakir Mohammed stares at a field of corn ruined by pests and unseasonably late rains. Rajeshree Chavan, a seamstress in Mumbai, has to sweep the sludge out of her flooded ground floor apartment not once, but twice during this year’s exceptionally fierce monsoon. The lakes that once held the rains in the bursting city of Bangalore are clogged with plastic and sewage. Groundwater is drawn faster than nature can replenish it.

Water being water, people settle for what they can find. In a parched village on the eastern plains, they gather around a shallow, fetid stream because that’s all there is. In Delhi, they worship in a river they hold sacred, even when it’s covered in toxic foam from industrial runoff. In Chennai, where kitchen taps have been dry for months, women sprint downstairs with neon plastic pots under their arms when they hear a water truck screech to a halt on their block.

Foam from industrial runoff drifted past worshipers in the Yamuna River in November.

The rains are more erratic today. There’s no telling when they might start, nor how late they might stay. This year, India experienced its wettest September in a century; more than 1,600 people were killed by floods; and even by the time traditional harvest festivals rolled around in October, parts of the country remained inundated.

Even more troubling, extreme rainfall is more common and more extreme. Over the last century, the number of days with very heavy rains has increased, with longer dry spells stretching out in between. Less common are the sure and steady rains that can reliably penetrate the soil. This is ruinous for a country that gets the vast share of its water from the clouds.

The problem is especially acute across the largely poor central Indian belt that stretches from western Maharashtra State to the Bay of Bengal in the east: Over the last 70 years, extreme rainfall events have increased threefold in the region, according to a recent scientific paper, while total annual rainfall has measurably declined.

A dam in Tembhapuri, Maharashtra State, was dry when the monsoon ended in October.

A dry well in Parshoi, Uttar Pradesh, in June. It ran out of water two years before.

“Global warming has destroyed the concept of the monsoon,” said Raghu Murtugudde, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Maryland and an author of the paper. “We have to throw away the prose and poetry written over millennia and start writing new ones!”

India’s insurance policy against droughts, the Himalayas, is at risk, too. The majestic mountains are projected to lose a third of their ice by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at their current pace.

Sewage and trash clogged a former creek bed in New Delhi in August.

But, as scientists are quick to point out, climate change isn’t the only culprit to blame for India’s water woes. Decades of greed and mismanagement are far more culpable. The lush forests that help to hold the rains continue to be cleared. Developers are given the green light to pave over creeks and lakes. Government subsidies encourage the over-extraction of groundwater.

The future is ominous for India’s 1.3 billion people. By 2050, the World Bank estimates, erratic rainfall, combined with rising temperatures, stand to “depress the living standards of nearly half the country’s population.”

Rural India Drought in the Marathwada region When rains fail, it compounds other problems. This year, a pest infestation in Maharashtra combined with drought to devastate millet and corn. In an effort to save their crops, the region’s farmers drew heavily on groundwater that is dwindling fast.

The Marathwada region, stretching out across western India, is known for its cruel, hot summers. Hardly any rivers cut through it, which means that Marathwada’s people rely almost entirely on the monsoon to fill the wells and seep into the black cotton soil.

Marathwada is also an object lesson in how government decisions that have nothing to do with climate change can have profoundly painful consequences in the era of climate change.

In October, just weeks before the traditional harvest season, Fakir Mohammed led me through his family’s one-and-a-half-acre plot of land. A neem tree stood in the middle of the fields. Lie under it, Mr. Mohammed said with pride, and you’ll never get sick.

The same could not be said of his land.

The rains had been deficient for most of the last nine years. This year, they came late, and when they came, the thirsty ground drank everything.

Then, an infestation of fall armyworm attacked Mr. Mohammed’s corn. The millet was ravaged by a fly. The cotton had flowered, but Mr. Mohammed could tell it would be a paltry harvest. “We worked very hard,” he said. “But we’ll get nothing out of this.”

A well in Maharashtra State. Filled by the monsoon, it was nearly dry again in October.

Worse, the rains this year did nothing to solve the community’s drinking water shortage. Even at the end of the monsoon, Mr. Mohammed’s well was dry. A dam nearby, built to supply drinking water to his village and nearly 20 others, had turned to scrubland, fit only for a few skinny cows to graze.

Water is so precious that the women of his family said they drank half a cup if they wanted a whole one. They went without a daily shower so their children could go to school clean and fresh. When their nerves were frayed, they smacked a child who spilled a cup by accident.

Every day, four government trucks came down the muddy lane to fill the village water tank, which met a fraction of what the village needs. Most people bought drinking water from far away.

Mr. Mohammed was grateful for whatever the clouds had to give this year, but he was also anxious. “There’s no water to drink, but at least it’s good for the fields,” he said. “I’m scared in my heart. I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future.”

Mr. Mohammed, who says he is around 60, is not wrong to worry. Since 1950, annual rainfall has declined by 15 percent across Marathwada, according to an analysis by Roxy Mathew Koll, a monsoon specialist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. In that same period, cloudbursts have shot up threefold.

Villagers in Uttar Pradesh collected dry mustard stalks for firewood in June.

Farmers in Jugail, Uttar Pradesh, lit fires in an effort to enrich soil before monsoons.

Sakto Pal, 69, in Uttar Pradesh, said his sheep often fall ill and require medication.

But here’s what’s shocking. Also during that same period, Marathwada, along with the rest of India, has seen a boom in the production of one of thirstiest crops on earth: sugar cane.

Down the road from Mr. Mohammed’s village, on land that gets water from an upstream dam, farmers had planted acres and acres with sugar cane. Why? Because sugar mills had sprung up across the state, some owned by politicians and their friends. They were ready to pay handsomely for cane.

Bizarrely, the taxpayers of India, one of the most water-stressed countries in the world, have aided sugar producers handsomely. The government subsidizes electricity, encouraging farmers to pump groundwater for their sugarcane fields, as well as fertilizers, which are used in vast quantities for sugar. State-owned banks offer cheap loans, which are sometimes written off, especially when politicians are courting farmers’ votes. This year, the government has approved nearly $880 million in export subsidies for sugar mills.

With all those perks, sugar cane production has grown faster than any other crop since independence from British rule in 1947, making India the world’s biggest sugar producer, according to an analysis by Ramanan Laxminarayan, a researcher at the Princeton Environmental Institute. Three-fourths of irrigated sugar cane production takes place in areas under “extremely high water stress,” the World Resources Institute found.

In October, just before the Hindu festival to mark the harvest, another Marathwada farmer named Ashok Pawar sent me pictures of ruin: Freakish rains had washed away his soy and mung beans. No one in his village had seen anything like it so late in the season.

August 2019 — Mumbai August 2019 — Mumbai August 2019 — Mumbai



Urban India Floods in Mumbai In another compound disaster, this year’s monsoons in Mumbai coincided with high tides on the Mithi. Sewers were overwhelmed, and fetid water backed up into the streets.

The image of the pot-bellied Hindu god, Ganesha, that hangs above Savita Vilas Kasurde’s narrow doorway is intended to keep obstacles away from her family’s path.

The same cannot be said for the Mithi River, which flows a few steps from Ms. Kasurde’s door. Its path has been blocked every which way as it winds through this city of 13 million people.

Mumbai’s international airport straddles the Mithi; you can see the planes taking off from Ms. Kasurde’s street. Sewage and rubbish pour into the Mithi. A vast spread of high-rises have been built on land reclaimed from the Mithi, along with higgledy-piggledy working class enclaves like this one, perched precariously on its edge. They are the ones that flood first and flood worst after a heavy rain. The city’s other natural defense against floods, mangrove trees, have been pulled out to make room for concrete.

Ms. Kasurde is a seasoned veteran. When the water rises, she hauls her fridge on top of the highest table, unplugs the television, wraps her children’s school books in plastic. When the water is up to her knees, she takes it all upstairs to the second floor bedroom. The power goes out when it rains hard. Going to the shared neighborhood toilet means wading through fetid waters. “We just sit in the dark,” said Ms. Kasurde.

Mumbai got more rain this year than it had in 65 years, and several times this season, it came in exceptionally heavy downpours. The drains overflowed. The lanes filled with muck. Commuter trains were disrupted. Flights were diverted. Several times in Mrs. Kasurde’s neighborhood, schools turned to storm shelters. Those without an upstairs room sloshed through the water to get there.

A resident of New Delhi washed under a broken municipal water line in August.

After each flood, as the waters began to recede, they returned to cover their noses and sweep the water and sludge out of their homes. Mosquitoes can breed in the puddles of dirty water. A dengue outbreak was the last thing they needed.

This is what worried Rajeshree Chavan nearby when I saw her in the middle of the monsoon. She had managed to save her sewing machine, the source of her livelihood, twice this year when her ground floor room flooded. She had to throw away a sack of rice and her kids’ clothes.

It infuriated her that politicians came through only when they were trolling for votes. Even the state’s top politician was here earlier in the year, she said. He wanted the neighborhood’s support for the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, she recalled. He promised new houses for people on higher ground, in the northern suburbs of the city. He left after giving symbolic plastic keys to five families.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

When their bodies were discovered in Mallapuram district in Kerala, Geetha was holding on to her son tightly. Two sisters, Anagha and Aleena, who hugged each other every night before going to sleep, were buried together in a massive landslide in Nilambur town in Kerala. Similar heart-rending incidents of loved ones lost in the recent floods in the country have been reported.

Just in three states -- Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka -- 227 people have died in the floods and landslides and the number is expected to rise as there are a large number of missing persons. More than 350 deaths have been reported from across the country, including in Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Bihar and Punjab. Over two lakh displaced people had to be shifted to because of inundation.

The economic loss is also colossal. It is estimated that every year there is a loss of over 3% of GDP (gross domestic product) due to floods. The Central Water Commission has estimated that from 1957 to 2017, a total of 1,07,457 people have died in floods and nearly Rs 3,68,868 crore loss of infrastructure has taken place owing to loss of houses, roads, bridges etc. In Maharashtra alone, the loss has been estimated at Rs 50,000 crore in the past two months. These losses include damage to property, loss of animals, dairy business and crops.

Flooded Cities

A large number of the cities have also gone under water. In fact, urban flooding is mainly due to poor drainage and faulty urban planning. The United Nations Environment Programme terms the flooding of cities as artificial and not natural. By artificial, it means that floods in cities happen because of the way infrastructure is designed in the cities, occupying the land mass and leaving little space for water sequestration, badly designed and constructed stormwater drains, which instead of collecting the storm water, spill it out on the roads and localities. Not to miss the absence of rainwater harvesting in the cities, which also leads to flooding.

Let us take the example of Delhi. There were 611 natural water bodies in the city, which were responsible for collecting rainwater and acted like reservoirs. Not just that, these were also able to maintain the ecological balance of the region. Out of the 611 water bodies, 190 are completely lost; either occupied by real estate or converted into parks. As many as 274 water bodies have dried up. There are various reasons for this. Either the water channels leading to these bodies have been infringed upon or there may be blockage in the drains that led water to these bodies. Interestingly, Delhi gets 580 million cubic litres of rainfall in the monsoon, of which nearly 300 million cubic litre gets drained off, creating flooding in the city.

Just a cursory look at three decades of old satellite maps of India’s capital city is enough to show how its water channels have been blocked. Gurgaon, which is in Haryana, but is part of the National Capital Region, is an interesting example of this. In Gurgaon, the water channels that led rainwater to two major lakes have completely been blocked. Recollect the shooting of a television serial, Fauji, which led to the projection of Shah Rukh Khan as an actor. The lake around which the shoots were done and in which he had nearly drowned, were not completely dry then.

With the construction of flyovers, housing projects and the Metro, the natural channels of water have been blocked, leading to massive flooding in Gurgaon, which houses many residential high-rises and office complexes. It is a living example of a city being built without a master plan. The city was developed initially by a private developer and then the master plan was created. Delhi, at least, has a master plan which is getting updated this year.

Project-Based Approach

After the 1990s, the initiatives of successive governments have been to achieve the desired growth in cities by developing projects instead of a policy shift in development, which should have been to integrate many agencies working on the ground. JNNURM (Jawahar Lal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission), RAY (Rajeev Awas Yojana) followed by the SCM (Smart City Mission), AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) etc., speak speak the same language of project-driven urbanisation.

The new Andhra Pradesh capital in Amravati is another disaster in the offing, as urban experts’ term it. The capital is being constructed on low-lying areas where there are a large number of water bodies. Amravati will be the future Chennai, they say, and this was proved recently when, as reported in the press, water entered the compound of the former chief minister Chandrababu Naidu’s residence.

Multiplicity of Agencies

Urban flooding is not just a problem of planning but also of multiplicity of urban governance agencies. Each city has a different governance structure. Some smaller cities are left to manage garbage, and infrastructure projects are done by some state government-run parastatals. Whereas in some other cities, there are many tiers of ownership and governance with regard to infrastructure. Take, for example, Delhi. Rainwater dropping from the top of a Metro track, owned by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (a 50:50 joint venture between the Delhi government and the Union urban development ministry), falls on the road, is taken care of by the Delhi government and eventually enters the stormwater drains managed by the municipal corporation. None speaks to each other. In many places one finds that the water from the Metro tracks does not fall through drain pipes, rather falls directly on the road and damages it. A simple way of integration could have been to harvest the rainwater directly from the Metro track and use it suitably. But without integration of governance, such a system cannot evolve.

Another major problem is related to construction of stormwater drains. Take the example of Shimla, a hill city. In the British era, stormwater drains were constructed with embankments of stone. This was done to ensure that water does not gush into the drain and percolates slowly to avoid flooding and also to recharge a large number of water springs in the vicinity. Recently, the Asian Development Bank funded a ‘beautiful city’ project in Shimla. The worst that could have happened in the beautification plan is the covering of storm water drains with concrete and porcelain.

This has made the main Mall Road cleaner, but at the cost of increasing the velocity of water in the larger drains, which causes flooding. Similarly, in the ‘level’ cities, the best method of constructing a drain is to concretise it, which then gets filled with muck and the water, instead of moving ahead, spills over on the roads and various localities. In Delhi, there are a large number of examples of such construction of drains.

What is to be Done?

Suptendu Biswas, an urban planner, points out that exactly 50 years ago, a book titled, Design With Nature, authored by Ian McHarg, was published, which emphasised on multifunctional landscape design paradigms. It focuses on natural, social and cultural processes and sees design as an iterative process that is shaped by interactions between humans and ecosystems. Biswas says that the planners have forgotten the essence of this approach of bringing the community and the diverse aspects of the landscape planning together.

Urban planning has become a mechanical process, which is extremely dangerous. John Closs, the former executive director of UN Habitat III, has said several times that we have to go back to the basics of planning and need to get rid of the laissez faire, i.e., the market will dominate the planning process.

The role of the State in guaranteeing ample number of planners to the field cannot be ruled out. Romi Khosla, a well-known city planner, says it is known that there is a shortage of planners and architects in cities, especially in smaller towns. He suggests a national service by the pass-outs from the planning and architecture colleges. For at least one year, as part of the internship programme, they should be sent to smaller towns to prepare their land use and infrastructure plans. This will be a win-win situation for both the cities and the students. The interface will help students understand the basics of planning better.

There are also examples of the citizens partnerships. One such example is the passion in which one million (10 lakh) wells are being dug in Bangalore by the traditional communities of the region. These wells are in the backyard of the houses, which will be filled with rainwater. This shall serve a twin purpose -- using the rainwater effectively and reducing flooding of streets.

Another example is the five kilometres stretch of nullah converted into a cleaner water stream and a walking space in Gurgaon. The technology is simple; it uses the storm water to recharge the nullah and the earlier sewer water flowing in to the nullah has been blocked and treated. The place has now become a walker’s paradise.

There are several such initiatives by citizen groups, but these are insufficient to meet the scale that we are talking about. That scale can only be filled by effective integration of planning, execution, governance, transparency and accountability. And, it is the State that needs to act on it.

Once the rain started, Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) issued warnings by dispatching messages through their mobile application to certain key areas. The centre has forecast heavy rain in the immediate future, and has intimated the same to BBMP. Scientists warn that 80 mm to 100 mm of rainfall could be enough to cause a disaster in Bengaluru.

Encroachment of Storm Water Drains (SWD) is largely responsible for the accumulation of water in low lying areas. An unnamed official source from the BBMP has said that the encroachment removal drive could not be taken up last year, as there were no surveyors. The drains deteriorate without maintenance, eventually reducing their ability to withstand rainfall up to a mere 35 mm to 40 mm. Thus, even if rainfall is not as heavy as it was in September 2017 (120% above normal levels), there is a possibility of flooding.

BBMP dispatches 100 pourakarmikas to clean Kodagu post flooding

BBMP corporators from all 198 wards have donated their monthly salary towards helping the victims of the flood- ravaged Kodagu District. The amount collected by Mayor Sampath Raj was Rs 2.8 crores for Kodagu and 1 crore for Kerala. Currently, 32 rehabilitation centers in Kodagu are providing shelter to 3000 people, and the death toll has reached 20.

Around 300 male pourakarmikas were sent to clean up the mess created by landslides, destroying the scenic landscape of the region. They were led by a team of 10 senior BBMP officials and health inspectors. The Kodagu district officials had requested the BBMP for 100 mobile toilets for women, specifically in relief camps. The toilets were sent overnight by truck, and have already been installed for usage.

Suburban rail, pod taxi and elevated corridor: Three projects get government push

Three much debated projects introduced in the Chief Minister’s budget for improving last mile connectivity have received a push through three different developments over the last one week.

The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for suburban railway system in Bengaluru could not begin work due to majority ownership by private entity, I-DECK Ltd. This road-block was addressed through ‘in principle’ approval by Railways Ministry to changes in the share holding pattern of the Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Ltd (K-RIDE), under which the SPV to implement the Suburban Rail Project for Bengaluru, will be set up. In the meeting held in Vidhana Soudha on August 21st, officials from BMRCL and BMTC participated in the discussion on the proposal sent by the state government to grant primary ownership back to the government .

This may be expected to assuage the anger of citizens who have been demanding a well-planned suburban railway network that would solve their commuter related woes. Activists from Citizens for Bengaluru (CfB) are gearing up for a campaign titled #ModaluTrainBeku on August 31st through a staged rail yatra in the afternoon.

Secondly, the pod taxi system is also officially under-way now. The rope-way enabled transit system that is proposed to connect 43 metro stations as a feeder service in the first phase has been suddenly approved by the BBMP without consulting the opposition.

Even with public outcry and scientific studies denying feasibility, the government is keen on elevated corridors for Bengaluru. In a meeting held with all stakeholders on August 25th, the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) evaluated the possibility of 53 entry and exit ramps every 2 to 3 kms along the corridors, along with parallel lanes for BMTC buses.

400 homes destroyed inside Bellandur slum

Kariyammana Agrahara, a slum settlement of 1500 dwellers and 400 odd houses, located roughly a kilometre away from Bellandur lake, was mercilessly bull-dozed by the BBMP on August 18th. BBMP alleged that the slum was formed over a rajakaluve eight years ago by migrants from UP, Assam and West Bengal.

Mayor Sampath Raj justified the severe action taken, saying the settlement was in the lake buffer zone, on land belonging to the government. He also said that several previous warnings had been issued to residents before the demolition drive.

Alternate Law Forum Lawyer Vinay Sreenivasa took on the accusation of encroachment made by the Palike, and said that the allegation was baseless. He argued that the settlement was situated at a distance of 1.3 km from the Bellandur Lake. This was in accordance with an order issued by the National Green Tribunal stating the buffer zone should be maintained within 50 metres of a water body.

Bangalore airport the world’s second fastest growing

Routesonline, a leading event management company in the field of aviation, released a report on August 22nd ranking the world’s fastest growing airports. The analysis put Kempegowda International Airport’s growth in the second spot, ahead of other airports located in Los Angeles, Madrid, Frankfurt, and Tokyo. KIA even beat Delhi which emerged in the sixth spot.

Experts say that Bengaluru being the Silicon Valley of India, there is a high population of techies who want to travel business class and this has contributed to the rise of passengers every year. In the first half of 2018, a total of 1,58,50,352 passengers were recorded travelling from Bengaluru by flight. This is reportedly an increase of 41,80,852 passengers compared to the first six months of 2017.

Only airports crossing 2.5 million passengers from January to June 2018 were studied for the ranking.

Many areas in the western parts of Bengaluru succumbed to overflowing stormwater drains. Contaminated water entering homes was a nightmare for many. Koramangala was one of the worst-affected areas in the city.Caught off-guard, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) had proposed to construct a parallel drain fromin4th block to. However, the work did not start despite BBMP finalising the bidder and sending it to the government for the approval.According to BBMP officials, the work did not start as respective file s went to officers concerned before the elections, but due to Model Code of Conduct, the files could not be processed.The BBMP, in its 2018-19 budget, had announced the construction of several parallel drains, but work has not yet begun in many places. However, according to BBMP, it has taken desilting works in these areas to prevent 2017-type situation. “We have removed the silt in these areas, though the expected works could not be taken.

I will return to my town in a month to see what is left. With most of our homes destroyed, we have nothing but memories of our childhood years in my home, playing near the river in Chengannur. Hari Varrier

By Reya MehrotraA Bengaluru techie has just returned from Chengannur – one of the worst-affected towns in Kerala – after spending three days trapped in his house along with his six-year-old son, 77-year-old father, mother-in-law and 82-year-old neighbour who moved into their house.Hari Varrier, a 42-year-old engineer who moved to Bengaluru in 2011 and lives in Whitefield, had to go to Chengannur for a family function on August 19. However, he left on August 14 along with his son and mother-in-law as he wanted to spend some time in his family home in Kerala. In his own words, this is how all of them survived as the waters begun to rise around them:“I lost my mother last year, so I wanted to spend some time at my native place. My wife was supposed to join us with my elder son on August 17. While we were on our way to Chengannur on board the Kanyakumari Express on Tuesday evening, it was raining and everything looked all pleasant. The rains did not stop even for a minute. After some hours, we saw some canals overflowing (as they normally do during). We reached Kerala at 10.30 am on August 15 and found that there was no electricity since August 14.“My native home in Kerala is around 300 metres from(areas along this river saw the worst flooding and loss of lives).Everyone was full of energy at the breakfast table since we had met after a long time. Some neighbours had informed us of the river overflowing but we did not expect it to affect us even though our home lies in a low lying area near the river.“A few hours later, we saw water on the road in front of our house. We thought it would retreat in a day or two as the flow was not too strong. Soon, the rains intensified and water reached the homes in our neighbourhood. We heard that bus services had been stopped in and around most parts of Kerala. The dams on Pamba River had been opened which led to a massive overflow.By 6 pm on August 15, Hari and his family knew this was not the normal waterlogging that Kerala sees during the monsoon. There was nearly knee-deep water outside their home. And it was difficult to figure things out since there was no power. The family decided to retire for the night.“At 10.30 pm, we woke up due to a foul smell. My brother’s family, my son and I were sleeping on the first floor; my father and neighbor, who had shifted to our house after the water level started rising, were sleeping on cots on the ground floor. We went down and saw that water had entered our homes. We quickly shifted our TV, food items, gas cylinder and other essential stuff on the first floor and moved the two elders up as well. By midnight, there was knee-deep water inside our house too. We had parked our vehicles on the elevated parking of our neighbour’s home but those were submerged in water too. By 3.30 am, six stairs, out of a total of 13, were submerged in water.“We slept only for an hour. By 5 am, we started hearing of the loss of lives (in Chengannur, many people died as the waters rose rapidly – something nobody had expected; defence personnel rescued 567 people trapped in their homes in this town). We were determined to survive.“We had minimal food and water, we were stuck on the first floor and could see water level rising around us; so to divert our minds, we kept chatting with each other. My sister-in-law kept my six-year-old son engaged who wanted to make a break for it as he had learnt to swim only a few weeks ago. She told him that it was serious situation and swimming out was not an option. We did not know for how long we would be stranded.”“On August 17, we ran out of drinking water. We started collecting rainwater in buckets and survived on that for the next two days.All this while, Hari and his wife kept in touch even though mobile signals were weak and his phone was running out of battery. She had alerted theand on August 18, Hari and his family saw a helicopter hovering above their house.“But the trees began to sway due to the force of the rotor blades and I thought they might fall. Besides, I didn’t want to risk winching up my father or son so I asked them to drop some food packets and return. They dropped some bread packets; most fell into the water and only two reached us. And the plastic water bottles burst on impact.“My wife reached out to NDRF again and this time our rescuers came in a boat around 3.30 pm. A number of families had been stranded. We asked them to take the elders first. The team acted with patience and kept us engaged while it took us back to safety. We reached after 2.5 hours. On our way back, I saw rivers overflowing and homes in ruins. It broke my heart; my beautiful hometown was in ruins.“After dropping other family members at a friend’s place, my brother and I then went to the nearest railway station and it was almost deserted. An official told us that a train was expected at 8 am although he was not very sure about its arrival. We packed our bags and reached the station on time. To our surprise, the train arrived and we boarded the almost empty train. We reached Thiruvanantha-puram on August 19. Then around 12.30 pm, we took a cab to Bengaluru and reached home at 2.30 am on August 20,” Varrier said.Varrier’s ordeal may have ended on a happy note but for thousands of people in Kerala, the road to recovery will be a long and arduous one – at least 370 people have died and over 7.24 lakh people are currently in relief camps; initial damage is estimated at upwards of Rs 4,400 crore; and the government says 220 bridges have been damaged and 59 are still under water.“I will return to my town in a month to see what is left. With most of our homes destroyed, we have nothing but memories of our childhood years in my home, playing near the river in Chengannur,” Varrier said.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

By Hemanth C SA boat ‘Made in Bengaluru’ specifically for urban floodsKerala is facing an unprecedented situation – nearly all thegates are open and most of its districts are inundated. Coastaland Kodagu are only slightly better off but a fresh batch of monsoon winds is pounding the areas. In extremely dangerous situations such as these, relief and rescue is ofimportance.A city-based innovator has taken note of this year’s situation and other instances where disaster management authorities have found it difficult to evacuate people using traditional inflatable and hard boats from urban low lying areas during floods. And he has responded by developing an Urban Flood Relief Raft (let’s call it UFRR for now).The body of UFRR is made of aluminium and frame of stainless steel. DC Shekhar, a formercaptain, claims it is ideal for evacuating people when urban low lying areas get flooded. It can accommodate four people, he said.“Evacuating stranded people in urban areas is altogether different as floods in urban areas present unique problems. Sometimes, people have to be evacuated only a few hundred metres away from their homes,” said Sekhar while giving a demonstration toMirror.“During the 2014 floods in Jammu and Kashmir, the army had used its boats to evacuate stranded people. These boats are heavy and fixed and they cannot be lifted or moved over any obstacle. The UFRR has greater mobility; each part is less than 15 kg and can be assembled by two persons easily within three minutes,” he said.Citing another drawback of the traditional inflatables, he said that they could get punctured while traversing in an urban setting where there are many underwater obstacles. As the body is made of aluminium and frame of stainless steel, the UFRR doesn’t suffer from that problem. In the eventuality of it getting damaged, water will not get inside as the raft is filled with light weight foam and will remain afloat even if multiple panels are damaged.Shekar’s firm has applied for a patent and also approached the Karnataka Civil Defence authorities and agencies of other states as well.“One of these days, we would want to demonstrate before the civil defence people -- maybe inLake. But before that, we also want to carry out a couple of trials to test the raft’s sturdiness. The trials include dropping it from a helicopter or crane into a water body,” Shekar said.Apart from government agencies, he is also considering residents living in flood prone areas in the city as potential customers.“As the raft’s panels are colour coded, they are easy to pack. In fact it can stored like a box in a garage and can be assembled and brought out whenever the need arises,” he said.The price of the raft is about Rs 1.6 lakh and additionally it can be fitted with a motor to tow additional rafts. Thewill cost about Rs 65,000. Towing lugs and oars are part of the raft for manual pulling or rowing.In last year’s floods, residents of Koramangala 4th Block had purchased anto move around their locality. With water-logging becoming a perennial issue in Bengaluru – and most other cities – due to poor planning, looks like Shekar has hit upon a million rupee idea.",,2019 Karnataka floods,Karnataka,July 2019,August 2019,"['Bengaluru', 'Ulsoor']",100 mm,Rs 100 crore,10,Thousands of people were displaced from their homes.,"{'dam': 'Paramount Dam', 'innovator': 'DC Shekhar', 'firm': 'Merchant Navy', 'price': 'Rs 1.6 lakh', 'motor': 'electric motor', 'inflatable boat': 'yes'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

However, we sincerely realise the intense sufferings caused to the people and the mammoth task of rehabilitation that the state faces.""Seeing the deluge and the sufferings of the people of Kerala, the soreness of the people of Majuli (in Assam), the largest river island comes to my mind and I, pledge to share the sufferings of my brothers and sisters in Kerala as I do with the brothers and sisters back home in Assam,"" he said.Sonowal also thanked the people cutting across political parties, organisations and regions for their service to the flood victims in Kerala.-- PTIThe Chief Justice of India and judges of the Supreme Court are contributing Rs 25,000 each towards Kerala flood relief fund. The money will be deposited in the Kerala Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund.The Chief Justice Dipak Misra had earlier in the course of a hearing said that judges of the top court too are individually contributing towards Kerala flood relief fund.The Chief Justice's statement came during a hearing of a contempt case against an organisation which alleged ""conflict of interest"" linking Chief Justice Misra with his ""cousin"" who is a lawyer and Member of Parliament.The issue involved was a plea seeking to debark the lawyers-turned-lawmakers from practising law during their tenure as lawmakers. The judgment on the issue has been reserved.Initially, the lawyer who also happens to be the General Secretary of the organisation offered a unconditional apology ""from the core of his heart and with folded hands.""However, senior counsel Shekhar Naphade, appearing for one of the petitioners, said it was too serious a matter and that apology should be accompanied with a monetary penalty.As CJI Misra was inquiring about the quantum of monetary penalty, Attorney General K.K.

What made us happier was when you said that we (fishermen) are your army.""But after that we heard that for our services we will be paid Rs 3,000.

In conversation with a scientist who has made a web app to visualise the flooding in KeralaMD, Scientist at, Mysore, discusses the web app he made to help visualise and assess flooding extents in the tragedy of the Kerala floods. Built in a day and finetuned in another two, the app uses data from a radar satellite called Sentinel-1, launched by the Eurpoean Space Agency, and was made entirely onEngine, which combines a multi-petabyte catalogue of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities. Earth Engine is freely available for scientists, researchers, and developers to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth’s surface.Why did you decide to create the app?Videos, images and written accounts of the flood provided a compelling account of the nature and intensity of difficulties that people faced during the flood. I also felt that it was necessary to convey a sense of scale or extent of the flooding that Kerala faced. Given that there were open data like radar imagery from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 satellite, and open analytical platforms, like Google’s Earth Engine, I put together a web app to convey to anyone concerned or curious, a sense of the scale of flooding that Kerala had experienced.The flooding extent has been estimated in relation to human settlements in these areas. Why has it been done taluk wise?Taluk is a well-known unit of administration that most people are familiar with. Visualising the flooding extent over larger scales – like at the district or even state level – is possible, but expanding coverage might mean that we lose detail. Through trial and error, I found that the scale of a taluk was visually optimal both in terms of coverage and detail.Why Sentinel 1 chosen over satellite imagery?In the peak monsoon season, the conventional “optical” remote sensing that most of us are familiar with, is not very useful because most of Kerala would be obscured by monsoon clouds, and all the flooding happening beneath the clouds would not be visible to satellites. But satellites such as Sentinel-1 emit radio pulses towards the earth, and use the ‘echo’ that they receive to produce an image. These radio pulses pass through clouds, and hence, radar satellites are capable of ‘seeing’ the earth in all kinds of weather, both during day and night. Secondly, Sentinel-1 is virtually the only radar satellite whose data are publicly available.How was the flooding mapped?We take two radar images: one before the flooding, and one after. Since most other features would be constant across the two images, most of the visible difference between them, would reflect the extent of flood. But, the actual implementation of this basic idea is, of course, a little more complex and involved.There are layers on the map. What purpose do they serve?The other layers are mainly for visualisation. They are the actual ‘before’ and ‘after’ satellite images from Sentinel-1, and a layer that depicts the distribution and density of human settlements, which is a global layer produced by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre. The human settlements layer is important because it can alert us to the likelihood of greater impact where high human concentrations and flooding overlap, as is visible in parts ofCan this app aid in rescue and relief efforts, spreading and aggregating travel advisories and planning for the future, knowing that some areas are flood prone?An app like this is really not meant to aid in immediate crisis management, rescue or relief operations. But there are a couple of contexts where I can see some value to an app such as this. First, it could help assess the location and extent of flooding at large scales, which, in turn, could help in prioritisation and resource allocation for rebuilding and recovery efforts. Second, maps emerging from an analysis such as this might help incorporate flooding risk into land-use planning both in urban and rural settings, so that the human and material impact of future flooding can be minimised. It is particularly useful for citizens themselves to have access to information that they can use. This is a small effort to help citizens in this regard.There are caveats, of course, such as the fact that you didn’t get images of peak flooding.A flood extent mapping exercise such as this would be reliable if the ‘after’ satellite imagery were available for the time when flooding is maximum. In this case, unfortunately, the Sentinel-1 satellite appears to have passed over Kerala a few days after peak flooding, when some of the water would already have receded. Hence, the map I was able to make with this data is the ‘minimum flood extent’, which would be less than the actual flood extent. Second, even with radar imagery, it is not easy to assess the extent of the flood in hilly regions, where the flood waters recede more quickly owing to the terrain, whereas flood waters in flatter terrain tend to remain longer. This in itself can bias results in a way that wrongly suggests less flooding in hilly areas. Therefore, these results are alright for visualisation, but any formal estimates need to be interpreted and used carefully, with a good understanding of the caveats.How do you propose to improve the app?If other radar imagery from the time of peak flooding exists and becomes available, it might be possible to update the map to obtain more reliable assessments of flooding location and extent.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

With heaps of garbage lying all over, residents say the area has become practically unlivable. And they fear an extended spell of monsoon could lead to flooding, like the one last year.A wall was demolished to clear the trash nearSignal in Koramangala, but what happened over the last four days turned a nightmarish affair for local residents and motorists: huge traffic pile-ups, unbearable stench and what not. Residents say the drain flowing near the signal road was choked with plastic bottles and other packaging materials. Civic authorities, who tried to clear the mess, broke the wall. The result was worse, with truckload of trash lying on the road.Suman R, a resident of Koramangala said, “The issue here is that the wall was broken and the trash accumulated there was taken out. Instead of clearing it, they dumped it on the road. For nearly four days, it took 20 minutes to cross this 600m stretch. Authorities are doing this as a knee-jerk reaction, but the larger issue is that these clogged drains will trigger floods during heavy rainfall,“ added Suman.Another resident said, “The drainage water is gushing into the road. Some residents have started dumping garbage, adding to the misery.”Bangalore Mirror did a spot check on Wednesday and found the road in total mess. “There isn’t even a proper traffic signal to moderate traffic in the area,” a truck driver said. Due to the chaos, the area is witnessing many accidents as well.Another resident said, “Residents have tried to get corporator M Chandrappa’s attention on the matter. But nothing has worked so far.” On Wednesday evening, a resident said the area was being cleaned.Residents oftoo are suffering from rain-related woes. Krishna Kumar, a techie said, “On Tuesday evening, it rained for 60 minutes or so. All roads witnessed traffic snarls. The road from Udupi Garden to Jayadeva witnessed heavy water-logging.”Kumar added, “Making matters worse,construction is going on. On the other side, footpath has been damaged. The situation is the same every time it rains.” Syed Pasha, another resident of BTM said, “The road has become so narrow because of the ongoing Metro construction. Imagine this is the road which leads to Silk Board. Why are authorities not focusing on these roads? They always talk about the mess in Whitefield. People should come and see and then they will understand that these roads are in bigger mess.”",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

On Saturday afternoon, four Bengalureans started a fundraising drive with an objective to collect Rs 50,000 for the flood victims of Coorg in 24 hours. By Sunday afternoon, they had collected approximately Rs 57,000 along with clothes for women. Sandesh Samuel, a law student, says, “ As we were discussing the Kerala floods, someone said that there’s too much talk and no action. This was our tipping point. We formed a Coorg relief fund group and circulated the link through social media platforms.” Besides money, the group was also able to collect essential garments for women. Sandesh adds, “We purchased cartons of petticoats and undergarments for women.” The group then sent the supplies they had collected through army trucks that left for Coorg on Sunday evening.” IT professionals Sajjan Subaiah and Adarsh, and Lameul David, an engineer from the city too, contributed to this drive.Road Thrill, a biker’s community that has its chapters all over India, also stepped in to help Kerala flood victims. Jacinth Paul, member of the Bengaluru chapter, says, “One of our bikers belonged to a small village in Kerala that housed 50 tribal families. The entire village was washed away in water. So we thought of lending a helping hand.” Around 75 bikers from the city came together to collect food, water and clothes from fellow members and citizens.

In the last few years, have you found yourself perspiring more than usual, while walking in core areas of Bengaluru city like Kalasipalaya? Well, it’s not just you. These are effects of the ‘urban heat island’ becoming more commonplace in the ‘Garden City’.

This graphic by Raj Bhagath Palanichamy, a researcher at the World Resources Institute (WRI), as part of the City Water Assessment Tool, shows temperature ranges in core Bengaluru. Neighbourhoods like Jayanagar (the green section in the top left of the image) and Basavangudi are facing less exposure to higher temperature when compared with Kalasipalaya (the red portion in the top right of the image) or Siddapura.

This is because of the lack of tree cover and parks in the latter neighbourhoods. Areas such as Shanthinagar bus depots /workshops (the big building in the centre) are heat spots. People working/living in these places are exposed to higher temperatures. The heat island phenomenon also results in higher night time temperatures in densely built up areas like Commercial Street, like a TERI study showed.

It’s not just central Bengaluru. Raj Bhagat’s analysis showed that in all, 2.6 million Bengalureans were exposed to temperatures higher than average between January and March 2017.

Emissions from the stagnant vehicular traffic add to the pollutants and heat, in turn prompt people to switch on air conditioning. This releases more heat and pollutants.

“Karnataka’s emissions are around 4% of the national carbon dioxide emissions,” says the Karnataka Climate Change Action Plan Report submitted by Bangalore Climate Change Initiative – Karnataka (BCCI-K), May 2011. This would have gone up by now, as vehicles, buildings and people have only increased, and green spaces have reduced.

BCCI-K has projected Bengaluru Urban district will get hotter by around 2° C in the years 2021-2050, compared to the temperature seen between 1961-1990. Apart from the known effects of heat on the human body such as heat stroke and mental fatigue, prolonged exposure to heat can cause severe health diseases like cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases among others.

Dr TV Ramachandra of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) has studied Bengaluru’s urban space. His research clearly establishes the correlation between temperature and loss in vegetation. The study Insights to Urban Dynamics through Landscape Spatial Pattern Analysis shows that area under vegetation has declined from 72% (488 sq.km in 1973) to 21% (145 sq.km in 2010). The situation has been worsening in the more recent past – the study notes, vegetation has decreased by 32% from 1973 to 1992, by 38% from 1992 to 2002 and by 63% from 2002 to 2009.” Bengaluru saw a 584% growth in built-up area over the past four decades.

Increase in pollution

The study, Effect of street trees on microclimate and air pollution in a tropical city by ecologists Harini Nagendra, Lionel Sujay Vailshery and Madhumitha Jaganmohan shows the relationship of environmental differences with the presence or absence of tree cover. Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) were high on roads without tree cover, with 50% of the roads showing levels approaching twice the permissible limits, while 80% of the street segments with trees had SPM within permissible limits. (60 micrograms per cubic meter).

The study states that, “street segments with trees had on an average lower temperature, humidity and pollution, with afternoon ambient air temperatures lower as much as by 5.6 degree C, road surface temperatures lower as much as by 27.5 degree C and sulphur-dioxide levels reduced by 65%.”

Increased flooding

It is obvious Bengaluru is increasingly flood prone, thanks to increasing built up area.

Urbanisation between 1973 to 2017 had a heavy impact on the decline in green spaces – there has been a 1028% increase in paved surface during 1973 to 2017, states a 2017 IISc study, Frequent Floods in Bangalore: Causes and Remedial Measures.

This visualisation shows vegetation decrease in the section between Bellandur and Varthur (1990 – 2018), denoted by red patches. The rampant urbanisation in the flood plains between the two lakes has been one of the causes for urban flooding faced in the Outer Ring Road over here.

Trees are critical for effective groundwater recharge, as they increase water retention, absorb water and slow down the rate of water run-off. They also reduce the intensity of rainfall and in turn flooding by stabilising the soil and channeling water safely.

What does Bengaluru really need?

More trees. More open green spaces. WHO standards recommend at least a minimum of 9 square metres green space per capita for better health and well being.

Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) says the city has around 50 lakh trees, even as it is yet start the long pending tree survey. However, a study by T V Ramachandra, Bharath H Aithal , Gouri Kulkarni and S Vinay on Green Spaces in Bengaluru: Quantification Through Geospatial Techniques estimates the numbers are closer to 14 lakhs – the city has just one tree for every seven persons. The study says, “Overall improvements in human well-being in urban areas necessitate at least 33% green space that ensures at least 1.15 trees/person.”

What is BBMP doing?

On the one hand, many trees are cut in the city for widening roads, or sometimes just to make way for hoardings or parking. Tree planting is tendered out to contractors who do not do a proper job of maintenance, because their bills are often not cleared. Saplings planted in many areas go unattended, and die in a few months, with no one to water or care for them. Another common mistake is to plant saplings on narrow roads where there is no parking space, automatically leading to removal of saplings or cutting of the trees by residents.

In the monsoon season of 2017, BBMP planned a drive to plant one lakh saplings by involving citizens who could request saplings for free, using an app. The app had 10,000 downloads but it is not clear how many saplings were actually planted by citizens.

BBMP’s website says they planted over 1,20,000 saplings. Vijay Nishanth, a green activist is sceptical about these claims, “If they have really planted this, it’s good; but how many had tree guards? were they watered properly? how many survive?”

Most drives are focused on streetside tree planting; however the real effect of soaring temperatures and flooding caused by vegetation loss can only be countered by large scale forestry programmes.

Ecologist Harini Nagendra points out the need for large connected patches of green space, “Large expanses of concrete cannot be cooled by just small stretches of avenue trees.” Connected stretches are also required to support biodiversity; Animals like slender loris and some birds need space to move around.

While there are reserve forests outside the city, near Nandi Hills and at Bannerghata park., the only green stretches in between are Lalbagh, Cubbon park, GKVK campus, army areas and some educational institutions. Harini says these are not protected and at risk of being encroached or built up.

In addition Harini notes that environmental and ecological benefits provided by a large mature tree cannot be substituted by planting a small number of saplings; The ability of trees in reducing temperature always depends on their size and girth.

Given this, what can we do to alleviate the problems caused by this extensive loss of vegetation in Bengaluru?

In the next part, we will look at initiatives which are working to fix to these issues.

About 26 people have lost their lives in the torrential rains that have caused flooding in many areas of Kerala. And as Kerala bears the brunt of incessant southwest monsoon, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) opened one of the five shutters of Cheruthoni dam on the Idukki reservoir. What proves the widespread destruction due to the heavy downpour is that the shutter of one of Asia’s largest arch dams was opened after 26 years! The shutter was opened after water level inched up to 2398.99 feet. The maximum storage level in the Idukki reservoir is 2403 ft.

Ever since the Idukki dam systems were commissioned in 1975, the dam has only been opened twice i.e, in 1981 and 1992 when the water rose to 2,399.04 ft. Both the incidents happened during the northeast monsoon in the months of October-November.

As per reports, the middle shutter of the dam was opened as part of a trial run to gauge the water level in the Idukki reservoir. On Friday, two more shutters of the Cheruthoni Dam were opened today as the water level touched 2,401 feet.

The water released from the Idukki reservoir will travel through the Cheruthoni river to meet the Periyar after a kilometre. The river the passes through Thadambiyad, Karimban, Bhoothathankettu and Perumbavoor to finally reach Aluva. The Periyar river the drains further into the Arabian Sea.

The Southwest monsoons have been vigorous for Kerala these years as 26 people have been killed, including 11 in high range Idukki in landslips on Thursday. Idukki has received 129.80 mm rainfall.

Not only Idukki but with heavy rains lashing various parts in Kerala, shutters of at least 22 reservoirs in the state have been opened to drain out excess water from the dams reaching the maximum capacity. As per the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, 241 relief camps have been opened & 15,695 people have been shifted from low-lying areas.

Carrying huge amounts of silt and rocks, it destroyed lives, houses and everything else that came its way. Five years later, film maker Abhishek Kapoor is out with a film that tells the story of the devastating flood that left Uttarakhand in shreds. Kedarnath, starring actors Sushant Singh Rajput and Sara Ali Khan, is a romantic drama set in the backdrop of the 2013 floods. The story revolves around a wealthy Hindu girl who is on pilgrimage at the Kedarnath temple, considered to be one of the sites at the Chhota char dham Hindu pilgrimage in the northern Himalayas, and a Muslim guide.

The film has been mired in controversy over the projection of an inter-faith love story. As it readies to hit the silver screen on December 7, here is a look back at the episode that shook the hilly state, leaving thousands dead and several others missing.

What exactly had happened?

Between June 13 and 17, the state of Uttarakhand had received an unusual amount of rainfall. This led to the melting of the Chorabari glacier and the eruption of the Mandakini river. The floods affected large parts of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Western Nepal. The heavy rainfall caused massive flash floods and landslides resulting in the death of residents and tourists as well as extensive damage to property. Reportedly the worst hit was the Kedarnath valley popular for the 8th century temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. The flood left behind a death toll of more than 5000. Ecologist Chandra Prakash Kala notes in a report that “the approximate cost of damaged bridges and roads was $285 million, dam projects worth $ 30 million and loss to state tourism worth $195 million.”

The upper Himalayan regions of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are difficult to access due to the difficult snow-clad terrain. But a good number of pilgrims make the trip every year thanks to its religious sites. Uttarakhand, in fact, has four Hindu temples — Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, Yamunotri — and one Sikh shrine — Hemkund Sahib — that bring in thoudands of pilgrims every year.

Kala notes that in 2011 approximately 25 million tourists had visited the area despite the fact that the region is highly susceptible to natural disasters like earthquakes, landslides and flash floods. Historical records shows the area had been affected by similar natural disasters back in 1893, 1968 and in 1970 when the calamitous impact of the flood had resulted in the Chipko movement.

What was the cause of the flood?

Despite the fact that heavy rainfall and cloudbursts are natural causes for the floods and landslides, environmentalists believe that the disaster of 2013 was a manmade one. “Unplanned and haphazard construction, mismanaged tourism and related activities including intensive mining in this fragile ecosystem are some of the reasons that made to name this natural disaster partly as man-made that increased the intensity and magnitude of damages,” writes Kala. Over the years the number of pilgrims visiting the area had also exponentially increased. In order to meet with the rising demands of religious tourism, the state government built an intricate network of roads, hotels, lodges and carried out other construction activities into the remote mountainous regions of the Himalayas. However, it is also true that the unexpected timing of the rainfall and the unusual amount of it also did not leave enough time for the pilgrims to evacuate, thereby increasing the magnitude of the impact.

How was the relief work carried out?

The relief work was carried out by a combined team of army, airforce, navy, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Border Security Force, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), Public Works Department as well as by local administration. Within five days, the army had deployed about 10,000 soldiers and the airforce had brought in more than 45 pieces of aircraft to carry out the rescue operation. The ITBP which guards the Indo-China border swung into action even before the army or the air force could reach the spot. They apparently managed to rescue more than 33,000 people from remote, inaccessible mountain zones. It is worth noting that after the disaster, the rescue operation in the region in itself has become a risky affair due to the unpredictable weather conditions, mountainous topography and lack of accessibility in majority of the routes.

In the aftermath of the disaster, the fear among pilgrims resulted in a severe blow to tourism, which is a major source of income for most of the local inhabitants of the place. The Nanda Devi Raj Jaat which is a most important festival in Uttarakhand that takes place every 12 years was scheduled to take place on August 29, 2013. However, the state government was forced to cancel it on account of the damage caused to roads and bridges. After 100 days of deafening silence the pilgrimage route to Kedarnath was finally opened on October 5, but only a small number of pilgrims were allowed at a time. However, religious tourism continued to remain affected for the next couple of years. It is worth noting though that despite the damage caused and the fear instilled by the floods, faith of the pilgrims was restored when they realised that though most parts of Kedarnath town had undergone a catastrophe, what remained untouched was the Shiva temple built in the 8th century AD.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The travails of city dwellers in India due to flooding and waterlogging will only increase unless town planners account for climate change effects while designing storm water drains

In a typically Indian paradox, large parts of the country remain water-stressed for a greater part of the year, but reel under devastating floods or severe waterlogging after heavy monsoon downpours. Adding to the concerns are new research findings that short-duration rainfall — for about three hours or so — will intensify and worsen, with implications for urban storm water design.

A study from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar, which analysed short-duration rainfall over three hours, has been published in the Geophysical Research Letters (GRL) journal.

The grim tidings come at a time when several regions in India are reeling under heavy rainfall and floods. This monsoon season — and it is only halfway through — floods and heavy rainfall have claimed 537 lives already. In the southern state of Kerala, for instance, excessive rainfall has led to widespread floods that have already claimed 22 lives in rain-related incidents.

In July, Bhubaneswar in eastern India was knee-deep in water. This week, Delhi citizens are bracing themselves for a Yamuna overflow. Mumbai faces flash floods routinely. In 2017, it was Bangalore, and before that Chennai in 2015 and Srinagar in 2014.

Short but intense

The IIT scientists say that urban areas in India face frequent flooding due to increase in short‐duration rainfall extremes. But researchers do not yet know how these events, which are relevant to urban storm water designs to prevent flooding, change under conditions of 1.5-degree Celsius rise and 2.0-degree rise in temperature, widely predicted due to global warming.

The scientists, who studied data from widely used climate models (Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project or CMIP5) and observations from satellites over the period 1979-2005, report that three‐hourly rainfall peaks are projected to increase by 20% and 25% if the global mean temperature rises above 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees, respectively, from the pre-industrial level. “Our findings provide new insights for urban storm water designs in India,” the report says.

This increase in short-duration rainfall extremes poses challenges for storm water design in rapidly urbanising India, they add. “Sub-daily precipitation extremes are more relevant to urban areas than daily precipitation extremes,” Vimal Mishra, associate professor at IIT Gandhinagar and lead author of the GRL paper, told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “These short-duration and intense precipitation events cause urban flooding within a very short time.”

“Moreover, sub-daily precipitation extremes are more sensitive to warming compared with daily precipitation extremes. Therefore, it is more important to consider sub-daily storm water infrastructure design, especially in the urban areas of India,” Mishra said.

Urban flooding may be result of two factors, he added — permeable soil surfaces being replaced by impermeable concrete floors due to rapid urbanisation, and the strong linkage between increase in urban rainfall extremes and temperature as shown in his team’s latest study.

“The urban heat island effect (UHI) can also modify the rainfall within urban areas. Therefore, urban flooding events in recent years are mainly due to the failure of current urban storm water infrastructures, which are not sufficient to handle the excess runoff over the concrete floors.”

No-change design, inaccurate models

Urban storm water drains and other infrastructure designs are based on calculations of the intensity, duration and frequency of rainfall in an area and plotting intensity-duration-frequency graphs, which scientists describe as IDF curves.

The curves assume that the rainfall occurrence patterns and distributions are spatially similar within a particular drainage area and remain unchanged or stationary throughout the lifespan of the drains. But with climate change projected to alter the rainfall patterns, such assumptions are no longer valid and could lead to inaccuracies.

“In the present scenario, we cannot assume stationary (unchanged) conditions,” Mishra’s colleague Haider Ali told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “If we still consider stationary design, our urban storm water infrastructure will not be efficient to handle excess runoff, leading to flooding.”

“Our study highlights the importance of redesigning the existing urban drainage system considering non-stationary atmospheric conditions,” added Mishra.

Higher resolution needed

India also needs to improve the resolution of its rainfall and temperature data for use in design. Scientists generally use the widely used climate models called the General Circulation Models (GCMs) to analyse projected rainfall under various global warming scenarios. But the models are of “very coarse spatial resolution and they use simplified physics,” said Mishra.

For example, he says, they miss out on several important physical processes such as air convection, one of the major causes of rainfall in the tropics where warm moist air, a result of ground heating, rises, cools and becomes saturated, forming clouds.

Another factor to consider in rainfall analysis is the so-called return period — the likelihood that the event will recur. Bhupendra Nath Goswami, currently with the department of physics at Cotton University at Guwahati in Assam, and former director of Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune, says that while “the need for estimating the return period of short duration precipitation extremes is certainly important, estimating it from the CMIP5 model projections (used in the study) may not be reliable,” which even the authors note.

The models severely underestimate the intensity and frequency of these precipitation extremes, he says. With the model’s best horizontal resolution being about 100 square km, it cannot resolve the small-scale precipitation extremes. “As a result, they all overestimate the light rain rates and underestimate the heavy rain rates,” he told indiaclimatedialogue.net.

The GRL paper follows Mishra and colleagues’ paper in Weather and Climate Extremes journal in June 2018, which looked at extreme rainfall events. The scientists used a combination of grid observations and simulations from two key climate models — CMIP5 and Climate of 20th century plus (C20Cþ) detection and attribution (D&A) project.

Increase in extreme rainfall events

They found that the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events have increased in India during the last few decades. From 1979 to 2015, so did the dew point temperature — temperature at which water droplets begin to form. A higher dew point means more moisture in the air, which leads to more humidity and discomfort at one level, and increases the possibility of cloud formation and rains at another.

The study also shows that the frequency of rainfall extremes is projected to rise more prominently in southern and central India in the middle and end of the 21st century, and that warming due to human activities contributes significantly to the rise of the frequency of extreme precipitation (rainfall and snowfall).

The paper says this has implications for infrastructure, agriculture, and water resources in India.

“At present, urban storm water designs are focused on flood engineering, on control and civil structures. There is need for flood management, flood to be also seen as a resource,” Suresh Rohilla, programme director, water programme centre at Centre for Science and Environment, a Delhi-based think tank, told indiaclimatedialogue.net.

The current and future urban development needs to provide for maximum possible flood management and moderation; as well as a run-off plan for flood engineering and control. “Flood water runoff needs to be also seen a major resource for a water stressed country like India, and there is a need is to store and moderate the rainwater runoff before letting it go to river, lake or ocean,” he said.

Urban floods

The increasing urban floods in India can be attributed to several factors, including increase peak runoff with increasing intensity of peak rainfall; rampant and uncontrolled increase in built up areas; and encroachments or systematically filing up of existing lakes, ponds, wetlands and floodplains for urban development such as housing and infrastructure, said Rohilla. See: Disappearing ponds destroying Bihar

India needs more water-sensitive urban design and planning; an integrated urban water management that takes into account water, sanitation, storm water, and integrated land and water management in its towns and cities. “All drains are sewage drains and used for dumping solid waste, mainly construction and demolition waste,” he pointed out.

India also suffers from lack of modern flood forecasting, shortage of monitoring stations and lack of capacity and skills in institutions and officials responsible for addressing flooding problems, Rohilla said.",flood,India floods,India,2018-07-01,2018-07-31,"Kerala, Bhubaneswar, Delhi","3-hourly rainfall peaks are projected to increase by 20% and 25% if the global mean temperature rises above 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees, respectively, from the pre-industrial level",537 lives already,22,urban flooding within a very short time,"Urban flooding may be result of two factors, permeable soil surfaces being replaced by impermeable concrete floors due to rapid urbanisation, and the strong linkage between increase in urban rainfall extremes and temperature as shown in his team’s latest study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Second, earlier floods were mostly riverine in nature, confined to the Brahmaputra-Barak Valley, the Indo-Gangetic plains and the deltaic regions of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. Now incidences of flooding are being reported from smaller river valleys, hills, plateaus, even deserts.

Third, urban areas are getting flooded much more frequently, and these are not limited only to cities on rivers or coasts. Now even cities such as Bangalore and Jaipur get flooded.

A number of factors are responsible for this new trend of flooding in the country.

First, the rainfall pattern is changing. While the average seasonal rainfall has not changed much, its distribution in space and time is changing: this is leading to an increase in the number of dry days, decrease in the number of rainy days, more intense downpours in fewer days, and heavier rains in areas that had scanty atmospheric moisture.

This has put pressure on the resilience of dams, drains and flood protection network, which were designed on parameters based on past rainfall/flooding pattern. They have now outlived their relevance. Their resilience has also been compromised, thanks to poor maintenance. Some of the colonial-era railway and highway bridges and dams are in dire need of an overhaul, retrofitting, even reconstruction. Much of the new infrastructure, houses and industries may not fulfil the global standards of resilience.

In our strategic approach to development, we are driven exclusively by short-term gains of value addition, profit and comfort; we hardly factor eco-system services in the cost-benefit analysis and calculation of internal rate of return of projects.

Our water bodies and flood plains, which provide natural cushions to absorb and drain excess water and recharge groundwater, have been encroached upon by unplanned expansion of cities and other human settlements. Our forests and bio-diversity, which help to protect slopes, prevent landslides and protect the environment, have been damaged by unregulated mining, quarrying and other development projects. The consequences are there to be seen in the damages and destructions of floods in Kerala, Kashmir and Uttarakhand.

We are committed by our policies and legislations to reduce risks and build resilience, but overtly and covertly, we are creating new risks of disasters that are compounding the already existing layers of hazard, vulnerabilities and risks. The Disaster Management Act 2005 and the National Policy on Disaster Management 2009 prescribed integrating disaster risk reduction in the process of development across all sectors and at all levels, but such integration and mainstreaming has remained largely elusive.

Our understanding of the dynamics of risks of disasters is still far from being comprehensive. Our multi-hazard early warning systems (EWS) have improved, but we are yet to develop a modern EWS for floods. We are able to forecast rain with reasonable degree of accuracy, but we are not yet ready with flood warning that would facilitate evacuation of people from the to-be-flood affected areas in the same manner as they are done during cyclones.

Despite the much talked about paradigm shift, our focus of disaster management is still largely on managing events of disaster (response, relief and rehabilitation) rather than on managing risks of disasters (risk assessment, risk prevention and mitigation and disaster preparedness). We spend more than 90% of our national and state budgets on disaster management (annually, around Rs 20000 crore by my calculation) on disaster response and relief, but we are yet to set up national, state and district mitigation funds that were mandated by law.

The tragedy of Kerala signals that the much-hyped shift in disaster management is yet to be achieved.

Karnataka’s Indiana Jones brings to life an 11th century Ganesha temple Naganath V Yadgir, an Ayurvedic doctor from Kalaburagi, is known for restoring old Kalyanis. On his birthday, September 12, he was all set to plant saplings at a particular spot at Sharana Shirasgi in Kalaburagi, when locals told him that an old Ganesha temple is hidden under the debris.

Fears of depleting groundwater in Kodagu, while rivers in DK grow thinThe Kerala government has asked for studies to be conducted on the abnormal drying up of wells and rivers right after the state experienced its worst flood in decades. Now, the situation in flood-hit Kodagu is such that even getting potable water has become difficult in some areas here.In Uppinangady, there is a drastic reduction in the water level in river Netravati. Farmers from Dakshinahave expressed concern about streams growing thin.The state government has maintained that 70 per cent ofis vulnerable to drought and that it has witnessed severe drought conditions for 13 years in the last 17 years. This year too, apart from the Coastal and Malnad districts, major parts of interior Karnataka are reeling under drought conditions. The South West monsoon covered the entire state by June 8. The rainfall pattern during South West monsoon was erratic and there was substantial variability within the monsoon season, including fluctuations between periods of normal/heavy rainfall and prolonged dry spells.Environmentalists said vanishing trees and sand mining is responsible for the erratic climate. Sundar Muthanna, Bengaluru Co-ordinator for Coorg Wildlife Society, said, “Like Kerala, the abnormal drying of rivers, wells are likely to affect flood-hit Kodagu too. The water level in river Cauvery in September resembles that of how it should be in January- February. Drought and flood cycles work in ecologies that are not healthy. It should not happen in a place like Kodagu or anywhere in Malnad.”He said the 54,000 trees cut for the High Tension power line proved to be the turning point for local ecology. “Temperature has become warmer then. About 7.35 lakh trees may be cut for upcoming highway projects in Karnataka most of which are in theregion,” he said.Shree Padre, Editor, ‘Adike Patrike’, a Kannada agricultural magazine, who is popularly known as the rain water man said, this phenomenon is totally unexpected. “I am afraid that much of the areas are affected seriously and it is happening a fortnight after months of continuous rains. We have six hard summer months to face. I do not see any big chance of rains making it up in the coming months for the deficit, even if we have flash floods or full day rain because of cyclone. This is an unprecedented water crisis,” he said.He requested authorities to prepare people for the water crisis. “Construct inexpensive series of check dams (sand bags) across rivulets and streams so that the water flow can be retained for a long period. The State needs a drought cell in every district under the Deputy Commissioner,” he said.V Govindankutty, Assistant Professor, Geography, Chittur Government College,in Kerala said ground water depletion is normal after floods. “One of the reasons is the opening of sandbars along coastline, which was earlier blocking the flow of the water into the sea. The opening of sandbars results in realignment as per the sea level. Also, the river bed itself has changed. There could also have been a re-distribution of groundwater due to opening up of fractures and movement water into these new areas. When the water in river declines the neighbourhood water table also goes down, hence drop in water levels in wells could be noted,” he said.When asked if there has been a fall in the ground water table in Dakshina Kannada, P Janaki, senior geologist Ground Water Directorate, Dakshina Kannada, said, “We visited parts of Sullia on Saturday and noticed a reduction in water levels, but this is a normal decrease because of natural evaporation. We will compile the data by the end of this month and get an idea if there is an actual fall in the ground water level.”",,2018 Karnataka floods,Karnataka,"August 17, 2018","September 10, 2018","['Kodagu', 'Dakshina Kannada']","['100 mm in Kodagu', '50 mm in Dakshina Kannada']","['100 houses damaged in Kodagu', '50 houses damaged in Dakshina Kannada']","['10 people died in Kodagu', '5 people died in Dakshina Kannada']","['Water scarcity in Kodagu', 'Drought-like conditions in Dakshina Kannada']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

: Sohra asks ‘What next?’ This 65-year-old woman, with her kin, is put up at thecentre in Palakkad, the headquarter of’s largest district, which has given the country luminaries like OV Vijayan, E Sreedharan and“Don’t know,” she replies after a pause. Her anxious utterance echoes the uncertainty of the over half a million people of the state displaced by one of the worst floods in the country’s history.75-year-old Thuththumma lost her ancestral house, where she spent 55 years of her life. “I keep telling political leaders visiting the camp that I will not vacate the camp until I get a new house. They agree,” she says. Tragedy has not dented her sense of humour as she confides a secret. “My Aadhaar card mentions my age as 95. I am actually 75.”Sohra and Thuththumma are part of the 700-odd people sheltered at ‘Apna Ghar’ (yet to be inaugurated), the complex constructed for migrant workers in Palakkad. Overlooking the camp is the BEML (Bharat Earth Movers Limited) complex, from where defence helicopters keep taking off at regular intervals for relief and rescue works. On Monday, helicopters flew to Nelliyampathy, which remains cut off from other parts of the district, with food and medicines.The relief camp has three kitchens where the people are served black tea at 6.30 am, followed by breakfast at 8.15 am, which include ‘konji’ `upppumavu’ or `puttu,’ an egg and banana and a milk tea. The vegetarian lunch has sambar and aviyal and rice is served for dinner. “Initially we tried chapati for dinner. But people said they get proper sleep if only they ate rice. Hence, we switched to rice,” says A Aisha and Reji Basheer (of Kudumbasree Mission), who man one of the kitchens at the camp.Many inmates of the camp leave in the morning to clean their inundated houses while the men, most of them daily wagers, have started going to work. They return to the camp in the evening.A team of homoeopathy doctors, led by district medical officer Latha AG, Dr Prabhat, Dr Swapna, Dr Balamani, Dr Uma and Dr Hamsa, besides a psychologist, attend to the people at the camp.Kerala is trying to recover from a gargantuan tragedy. A visit to Palakkad relief camp and collection centres shows that people are not willing to give up. They are resilient. People are trying to move on, buoyed by the compassion pouring in from within and outside the state. Quite surprisingly, this correspondent noticed a long queue in front of anMarket outlet.An indoor stadium, the construction of which is not over yet, is serving as the collection centre, where materials moved in from outside the state is collected, sorted out and sent to relief camps in Palakkad. The stadium is abuzz with activity with volunteers, which comprise of college teachers and women students, who keep working 24X7 as trucks keep coming in, loaded with material from outside the state, particularly from. The volunteers sort out the things, make a kit and distribute it to the relief camp.Sunoja, who lately completed her degree course from Victoria College, joined the volunteers on Monday. “Our house got inundated with water. We shifted to a relative’s house and once the water receded, we returned home yesterday. I was able to serve in this collection centre only today,” she told Mirror.C Abhilash, who is spearheading the operation at the centre, said that at least 20 trucks arrive at the centre every day and the volunteers work 24 hours without tiring out.The situation in Nelliyampathy is not as grim, say the locals Yes, the village is marooned. But food and medicines were reaching the people living there.It is understood that 17 people died in Palakkad district in the recent floods. Of them, 11 died due to landslide while the others due to flooding. Nearly 9,822 people live in 107 relief camps in the district.The rail and road transport services have resumed in the city. One could see transport buses plying on the rain-battered roads. Several shops, including bakeries, hardware shops, tea stalls, hotels, dental clinics, photostat shops and Ayurveda pharmacies, were open on Monday although the customers are missing.Unfortunately, there are reports of mischievous elements trying to capitalise on the tragedy by exploiting the people. For instance, at the Palakkad relief camp, the wife of a casual labourer Ramani told Mirror that the rental house in which they were living collapsed in the floods. Now, they are searching for a new house. But the homeowners have ratcheted up the advance demanding Rs 20,000 for a two-room house, she said.Ironcially, many have pointed out that the catastrophe has brought to the fore the best human quality in the people of the state, who were otherwise divided into communal and political lines and were spitting venom against each other. ""The floods brought them all together. People here also acknowledge with gratitude the generous helping hand extended by the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu,"" a native of the district said.As a testimony of the tides of compassion cradling the tragic-hit state is the gesture of a class II student of Vellore in Tamil Nadu. The girl Anu Priya donated her Rs 8,240, which she had saved over the past two years for the Kerala CM’s distress relief fund. She had actually saved the money, in coins, to buy a bicycle for her birthday. The Hero Cycles has responded to her compassionate gesture to Kerala flood victims by offering a bicycle free of cost to her.The LDF government has meanwhile claimed that the rescue mission following the catastrophe has reached the final phase. By now, nearly 8 lakh people have sought shelter in relief camps across the state.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The torrential rainfall in the state has left 37 people dead in the last five days. According to the preliminary assessment by the state government, Kerala has suffered a loss of Rs 8,316 crore, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who did an aerial survey of the flood-affected parts on Sunday, announced a relief of Rs. 100 crore.

The IMD, in its fresh warning, issued a ‘Red alert’, asking people to be cautious as there was a possibility of heavy to very heavy rainfall in most places in Idukki, Wayanad, Kannur, Ernakulam, Palakkad and Malappuram districts in the next 48 hours. Fishermen have also been advised to stay away from the Southwest and Central Arabian Sea as conditions are likely to be very rough.

However, the water level in Idukki and Idamalayar dams receded, bringing some relief to the people. The water level in Idukki dam, which shot up to 2,401 ft on Thursday, came down to 2,398.50 ft Sunday evening, mitigating the fear of flood in Ernakulam district. The dam, opened after a gap of 26 years, has been discharging water at the rate of 750 cubic meters per second since Friday.

Vijayan pegs damage at over Rs 8,000 crore

As per the preliminary assessment, the rains have caused an approximate loss of Rs 8,315 crore, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a memorandum submitted to the Centre. The memorandum sought urgent sanction of Rs 1,220 crore from the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) to meet the situation. “State Government would request the Union Govt. to declare the calamity as that of ‘rare severity’ and provide the required funds and assistance,” Vijayan said, adding that the impact of the monsoon havoc will be felt for a long time in the state.

Following unprecedented rainfall in Kerala, as many as 31,075 people were staying in 302 temporary relief camps. As many as 211 incidents of landslides were reported during the period. Ten columns of the Army, a unit of Madras Regiment along with personnel of the Navy, Air Force and NDRF are engaged in relief and rescue work in badly-hit districts, including Kozhikode, Idukki, Malappuram, Kannur and Wayanad, Defence sources said. Nearly 20,000 houses and at least 10,000 km of roads have also been damaged in the floods.

Unprecedented flood situation in Kerala, says Rajnath Singh

Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who made an aerial survey of badly affected areas in Idukki and Ernakulam districts, said the rains and floods had caused “massive damage” to the farm sector and infrastructures like roads and power. “It is unprecedented because never before in the history of independent India has Kerala witnessed such massive floods.

Since assessment of the damage will take time, I hereby announce immediate relief as advance of Rs 100 crore,” he said on Sunday. “The Centre is extremely sensitive to the needs of Kerala at this critical juncture,” he said. Singh added the immediate assistance of Rs 100 crore was apart from the aid of Rs 160.50 crore announced earlier.

‘Operation Madad’

The operation was launched on Thursday to assist the state administration and undertake disaster relief operations due to unprecedented flooding in many parts of Kerala following incessant rainfall and release of excess water from Idukki and other dams.

Based on a request received from deputy collector, Wayanad, one diving team with Gemini inflatable boat was airlifted and sent to Kalpetta on Thursday to undertake rescue operations, an Indian Navy spokesperson said.

Naval helicopters are also deployed for ferrying divers, power tools, axes and relief material to the flooded areas to augment ongoing relief operations.

The operation continued on Friday with all resources available with the southern naval command.

Two teams with Gemini boats commenced rescue operations at Kalpetta, Wayanad and at Panmarum, 13 km south of Mananthavady, where they evacuated 55 stranded people on Friday.

Another team was air lifted by Seaking helicopter to Kalpetta with all gears and two electric Generators requested by the district administration.

Three additional diving teams have also been dispatched to Aluva for augmenting the rescue.

The spokesperson sad a 50-men contingent was positioned at Naval Armament Depot (NAD) Aluva fully equipped for assistance in any kind of eventuality.

“In addition, the Naval Hospital, INHS Sanjivani is ready for rendering medical assistance as required and all preparations towards setting up community kitchen by naval personnel from INS Venduruthy have been made in case the need arises.”

‘Operation Sahyog’

The army pushed its men and machinery into disaster relief and rescue operations at Kannur, Kozhikode, Wayanad and Idukki after incessant rain and landslides hit various northern districts of the state.

An army spokesperson said Karnataka and Kerala Sub area Headquartered at Bangalore was controlling the “Operation Sahyog” in Kerala.

A total of eight columns of army personnel were deployed in various parts of Kerala in which two columns were exclusively kept for the worst-hit Idukki district.

One column of Army from Pangode Military Station under the leadership of a Captain carried out the relief operations in Adimali area in Idukki district. One column of army was deployed at Idukki from Defence Security Crops in Kannur.

In addition, 80 Army personnel from Madras Regiment were deployed for ongoing rescue and relief operation for tourists at Pallivasal in Idukki.

Further, two columns of Army personnel from Pangode Military Station were expected to reach at Aluva by Saturday morning.

An army spokesperson said the timely intervention saved many lives and properties in the flood-hit districts.

The army constructed temporary bridges for the evacuations of the stranded people from the isolated villages.

Kerala Floods: Lottery winner donates winning ticket to CM's relief fund Hamsa, a lottery agent and salesman who lives in Anchal in the district of Kollam, won the Nirmal Lottery, conducted by the state government of Kerala on August 10. He was eligible for Rs 1 lakh as prize money.

Thechief ministeron Thursday maintained that the recent floods, the worst in a century, was caused by unprecedented rainfall.While addressing the special session of the legislative assembly convened to debate the recent deluge, and the way forward for the state, Vijayan said that 483 people died in the catastrophe which included landslides and flash floods. The people who went missing in the deluge was pegged at 14 while 140 people suffered injuries and were hospitalised.Highlighting the rescue operations which helped curb the death toll from mounting, Vijayan said 7443 defence personnel and 40,000 police personnel were involved in the operations.The deluge sent 14.5 lakh people to relief centres. Presently, 59,296 people belonging to 16,766 families still remain in 305 relief centres, he said.The call for the contribution of funds from people living within and outside the country to the chief minister’s distress relief fund has evoked a good response. Till Wednesday, Rs 730 crore has been received.In the state, 57,000 hectares of agricultural land went under water. The loss incurred to electricity department was to the tune of Rs 820 crore.Vijayan maintained that the India Meteorological Department forecasted that state would receive 98.5 mm rainfall but the actual rainfall received was 359.2 mm rains.The special session saw the opposition Congress party legislatures train their guns on Vijayan’s government as they reiterated that poor dam management and correlated oversights led to the loss of hundreds of lives and properties.The government failed to foresee the approaching danger. The delay in deploying the army for rescue works and other such lapses made life miserable for the people. The Congress legislatures asserted that the recent deluge was ‘man-made’.On the same hand, the opposition assured all support to the government for rebuilding a new Kerala.The common complaint aired by the legislatures include that many people have not received the Rs 10,000 announced by the government for people leaving relief camps for their houses. Those who sought shelter in their relatives' houses should also be provided with the compensation, they urged.The veteran CPI (M) leader and former chief ministerchose the occasion to prod the government on the consequence the state had to face for pursuing unbridled development at the cost of the state’s natural resources. He urged the government reconsider its policy of rampant development and keep away profit-oriented corporates from environmentally fragile areas. He disapproved the waypanel report to protect the Western Ghats was politicized by the state instead of approaching it scientifically.

Kerala floods

The massive flood in Kerala has been declared a, the Union home ministry said on Monday.""Keeping in view the intensity and magnitude of the floods and landslides in Kerala, this is a calamity of a severe nature for all practical purposes,"" a home ministry official said.At least 216 people have lost their lives in the rains, floods and landslides in Kerala where over 7.24 lakh displaced people have been sheltered in 5,645 relief camps.When a calamity is declared to be of 'rare severity'/'severe nature' support to the state government is provided at the national level. The Centre also considers additional assistance from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).A Calamity Relief Fund (CRF) is set up, with the corpus shared 3:1 between Centre and state. When resources in the CRF are inadequate, additional assistance is considered from the National Calamity Contingency Fund (NCCF), funded 100 per cent by the Centre. Relief in repayment of loans or for grant of fresh loans to the persons affected on concessional terms, too, are considered once a calamity is declared ""severe"".An inter-ministerial team led by AV Dharma Reddy, Joint secretary, ministry of home affairs, had visited Kerala on August 8 to assess the damage caused by the rains and floods.Another official said that an inter-ministerial team visits a state in view of any natural disaster, it automatically considers is as calamity of severe nature.Union home minister Rajnath Singh had visited the state on August 12 and declared an immediate assistance of Rs 100 crore to Kerala. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his visit to the state on August 16, had announced an aid of Rs 500 crore.The central government has also decided to give ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh each to the family of those killed in the floods and Rs 50,000 to the injured.The compensation will be given from the Prime Minister's Relief Fund.The Congress and the Left parties have been demanding that thebe declared a national calamity.However, the Centre today informed the Kerala High Court that there was no provision in the statutes or manuals to declare a disaster as national calamity.In an affidavit, the Centre said it has treated the Kerala flood situation as a ""Disaster of Serious Nature and has categorised the same as 'L3 Level of Disaster,' under the National Disaster Management Guidelines.""""It is submitted that there is no provision in statutes or manuals to declare a disaster as ""National Calamity"", howsoever big it may be.It is only an expression used in general parlance, the Centre said.The affidavit was filed in response to a petition for declaring the flood as a national disaster.In reply to a question in Parliament during the recent monsoon session, Minister of State (Home) Kiren Rijiju had also said that there is no provision, executive or legal, to declare a natural calamity as a national calamity.""The existing guidelines of State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF)/ National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), do not contemplate declaring a disaster as a National Calamity,"" he had said.Besides Congress president Rahul Gandhi, the ruling Left Democratic Front in Kerala had wanted the Centre to declare the floods a 'national disaster'.The National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC), the country's apex body to handle emergencies, has been regularly monitoring the flood situation in Kerala.Yesterday, the NCMC had directed that focus should now be on provision of emergency supplies of food, water, medicines and restoration of essential services such as power, fuel, telecom and transport links as flood water recedes in Kerala.The Army, Navy, Indian Air Force and the National Disaster Response Force have been continuously engaged in rescue and relief operations in all the 14 flood-hit districts in Kerala.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
279,1357,bangalore,2018,https://thewire.in/media/backstory-how-not-to-cover-a-flood,25 Aug 2018,Backstory: How Not to Cover a Flood,"As the waters steadily rose in Kerala on August 15, the eyes of the nation were focused on the Red Fort and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, wearing a smashing saffron safa (pop politics: the only Independence Day safa Modi has worn on such occasions which had a prominent touch of green was in 2014, since then the saffron in the turban has steadily come to dominate the colour schema – should we read something into that?). He spoke for over 90 minutes on an assortment of topics – from toilets to coal block auctions – even as the waters were steadily rising in coastal Karnataka and Kerala and in many other regions of the country. Not once did he refer to the trial by water that so many of his fellow Indians were experiencing.

Coverage of the prime ministerial Red Fort oration swamped the news space thereafter, both on television and in the newspapers in northern India the following morning. We were told that here was a man “impatient” to change India, even as the India of the here and now had one corner of it flooded out, with people dying, hundreds of thousands marooned, and one of Kerala’s lifelines – Kochi airport – shut down. The naval base in Kochi was working to bail out people 24X7, and some battalions of the Rapid Action Force were doing their best. The army that would bring in the critical mass of personnel and machinery that the situation required was still being awaited.

As the death toll touched the triple figure mark and climbing, it was one death that came to dominate the news cycle from the evening of August 16 – that of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. A flood of coverage followed, even as the flood waters receded from national consciousness. Kerala recorded 915% excess rain on that day. One newspaper gave its entire front page to the Vajpayee death on the 17th, another overflowed with fulsome prose and a headline that read, ‘Politics Loses Its Poetry’. News television could not drag itself away from this story, with everyone who had even a nodding acquaintance with the former prime minister allowed to wring out their every memory about him in television studios, sometimes on multiple occasions, even as over 300 hundred died in flood-hit Kerala.

As The Wire piece, ‘Anatomy of a Flood: How Kerala Withstood a Calamity’ (August 21) noted, “Regular communication with the Central government and daily stock-taking meetings of the National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) notwithstanding, the demand for more choppers was taking time. When Chengannur MLA Saji Cherian called up multiple news channels and broke down on air – explaining how most of his constituents have been stranded without food and water for three days – the scale and magnitude of the tragedy suddenly dawned on everyone. And, for the first time, it seemed things were getting out of control on August 17.”

It was only by the 18th that the full force of national effort and media attention slowly began to be paid to Kerala, helped without doubt by the news that the prime minister planned to visit the state after the Vajpayee funeral to be held that evening. Army operations had begun in right earnest the day earlier and the chief minister tweeted on the 18th that “Attempts to rescue the stranded are on a war-footing basis. 4 helicopters, 5 military boats & 65 fishing boats are part of operations. Four 100-member strong army teams have been deployed. Food is being supplied using helicopters.” Of course, for too many, this was far too little and too late, much like the Central assistance of Rs 500 crore (in addition to the earlier announcement of Rs 100 crore) that the prime minister announced after his visit and short aerial survey. The first editorial on Kerala in a national newspaper also appeared on the 18th (‘Kerala’s trauma’, The Hindu).

By the 19th, there was a general acknowledgement that the worst was over. Ironically, it was only when this point was reached did we have a spate of stories on various aspects of the disaster and reports on other regions similarly battered, like Karnataka’s Kodagu district. This happens all too often: when media coverage is really needed to help those on the ground, it is missing. Once the worst is over, we have an information overload on the subject to the extent that people groan, “Oh no, not another Kerala story!”

The Wire, incidentally, also fell into the same trap, failing to recognise the importance of a breaking story and giving it more attention. I am not surprised by one of the responses from a reader. Ramya Mohandas describes herself as a “regular contributor” to The Wire, and follows it “because you cover the news like it should be. Bring the truth out and talk about what is important and trying to be hidden”. She was, however, disappointed that Kerala was not The Wire’s top story on its cover page of August 17, in which a piece entitled ‘Under the Weather: Narendra Modi’s Crop Insurance Scheme Veers off Target’ was given top billing, while Kerala was barely there but not there. She firmly chides us: “Do not act like yet another national media only focusing on North.”

Media coverage in Kerala, we know, was a study in contrast, as noted in The Wire piece cited earlier: “A word of praise might be due to the vibrant media in Kerala – especially news channels – for the way they covered the calamity 24/7. Many channels even had a control room operating from their studios.” Other platforms too like Newslaundry (‘#KeralaFlood: Malayalam news media shows the way’) took note of this.

So what does delayed coverage of a national disaster signify? Most obviously, of course, the urgent response from the entire country that situations like these warrant is slow in coming. Obviously given finite media space, there will always be the “squeeze” factor. After all, the media could not have ignored the Independence Day and the Vajpayee developments. The question really is how much coverage does the latter warrant? Television could even have thought of parallel tracks on Kerala, even while the discussions on Vajpayee were going on. Ditto for print and internet media. But the “take all” billing that comes with stories that have to do with the establishment, militates against such calibrated use of news space.

Equally worrying is that the vacuum created by the lack of edited, fact-checked coverage is immediately swamped by fake news of all kinds. On August 19, the Indian army was forced to call out an “Imposter wearing Army combat uniform in video spreading disinformation about rescue & relief efforts.” The two-minute video, that quickly went viral on August 18, appeared on a Facebook page called the Bharatiya Mahila Morcha Thalassery Mandalam, according to the web portal News Minute. The fatigues-clad man had railed in the tweet: “I am addressing the Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan. Why do you have so much animosity towards the Indian army? Is it because your minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan doesn’t want the army to come to your state? Thousands are stranded in Chengannur. Just let us come and do our work. We will not take over your state. Don’t be scared. Aren’t you bothered about your people? We do this kind of rescue operation everywhere around the country. This isn’t anything new for us. So am begging you to just let us come to Chengannur and do our work. Let us in.”

Many other bits of fakery, such as one on the Mullaperiyar Dam about to burst, only traumatised further already panic-stricken people. As for tweets like the one put out by the eminent chartered accountant and the new appointee to the RBI Board, S. Gurumurthy: “Supreme Court judges may like to see if there is any connection between the case and what is happening in Sabarimala. Even if there is one in a million chance of a link people would not like the case decided against Ayyappan,” the less said the better. One should perhaps consider such tweets as part of the Newspeak of New India.

The Kerala floods are perhaps the first national disaster that has been bombarded by hate and polarised speech. The controversy over UAE’s offer of aid needed a civilised discussion and response, but came to be viewed through the threat-to-national-sovereignty lens that our prime show hosts have permanently fitted into their designer glasses.

The coverage of the Kerala floods provides us with a great template of how not to cover floods.

Gauri Lankesh will not die

It’s almost a year since Gauri Lankesh, intrepid journalist and fighter of right causes, was brutally gunned down on September 5 outside her home by assailants coming under the cover of darkness. Investigations into her death have helped to unravel the web of hate and religious fanaticism that linked her assassination with those of Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare and M.M. Kalburgi – all of them courageous wielders of the pen in defence of rationalism and the power of truth (‘Suspect in Gauri Lankesh Killing Confesses to Involvement in Kalburgi Murder’, August 17). This is what Gauri Lankesh had written so presciently in the Bangalore Mirror on August 31, 2015, when she learnt about Kalburgi’s assassination: “No one knows who will gain materially by Kalburgi’s death. But it is clear that it is the right-wing fascist forces which will gain ideologically when reforming voices such as Basavanna’s and Kalburgi’s are brutally and fatally shut down. Ideas, however, never die” (excerpt is from The Way I See It, edited by Chandan Gowda).

The words hold true in her own case as well. Her ideas live on, even as the vendors of hate that eliminated her continue to search for other targets. When Umar Khalid was confronted in the heart of the capital by an assassin’s gun two days before Independence Day, it was her fate that went through his mind. “I was being reminded of what happened to Gauri Lankesh” (‘Where the Mind Is Not Without Fear’, August 13). The fear was real, but so was a sense of fearlessness fostered by people like Gauri.

The Gauri Memorial Trust is now hosting a commemorative week from August 30, which would include protests, conventions, two-wheeler jathas, and cultural evenings, across Karnataka. They welcome the participation of people from across the country in these programmes (for more information, people can contact professor V.S. Sreedhara at [email protected] or 9448127571 and K.L. Ashok at [email protected] or 9448256216/8073288365)

There was a time when journalists who were censored accepted the inevitable, quietly swallowing any attack on their work and sense of professionalism, and carrying on as if nothing had happened. Now it seems there are some who are refusing to hunker down discreetly or go quietly into the night. On August 2, Punya Prasun Bajpai resigned as the anchor of ‘Masterstroke’, ABP TV’s popular programme, and then promptly provided the world with a forensic account of the circumstances of his exit, which included a telling description of the government’s three-tiered system of media surveillance and control (‘Exclusive: Punya Prasun Bajpai Reveals the Story Behind His Exit From ABP News’, August 6).

Now comes the story of the Mail Today cartoonist Satish Acharya (‘Why Mail Today Will No Longer Be Carrying My Cartoons’, August 12). It was a similar story against a different backdrop. First, a cartoon showing a cow had to go because the editor was not too happy with it. Then a cartoon on lynching drew the lofty response that the “India Today Group has decided not to come out with any community-based cartoons.” A cartoon on Modi led to the cartoonist being asked to “replace Modi’s character with any general BJP character.” The “Muslim” angle in one cartoon discomfited the editor; just as a “demonetisation link with 100% electrification” disturbed him, and so it goes. While Acharya’s careful listing of these attacks on his professional output allegations have been dismissed by the editor as “baseless”, but it does appear that for many editors in today’s India, censorship is the better part of valour.

Unfortunate as this is, we should take heart from the immense courage of those speaking out. Ultimately it is about pride in one’s work. Acharya with admirable directness reveals that he spoke out because “I thought I need to do justice to the cartoon space that goes with my name.” Bravo!

Vishnu Sharma argues that Hiren Gohain’s ‘It’s Important to Know the History of the NRC Before Passing Judgment on It’ (August 8) is not only misleading but is a veiled attack on humanists and all those questioning NRC. First, he argues, Gohain’s mixing of human rights and humanism is tricky. “Human rights are a means to achieve humanism and not the other way round. There will always be the possibility of it being manipulated, but that doesn’t mean that we drop it altogether. What opponents of NRC, like me, are against is the manner it was conducted as well as the cutoff date of 1971 for identifying the ‘intruders’. His argument that because of outsiders Assam did not grow is also selective. There are other states in India, like Chhattisgarh and Odisha, which are poorly developed not because of ‘intruders’ but because of the exploitative nature of the current ‘development’ model. But unlike Assam, people of these states can’t blame it on ‘illegal migrants’. Even if Assam is made ‘intruder’ free, there is no guarantee that it will become the Shanghai of India. He calls the NRC ‘a legitimate constitutional exercise monitored by the Supreme Court.’ I don’t want to think what he would say if the SC decides to give all ‘intruders’ citizenship? ‘But can anyone in their senses claim there has been no infiltration at all?’ he asks. Mr Gohain, there will always be ‘illegal’ people who migrate to ‘developed’ places. But throwing out the already migrated is not a solution. It’s only by trying to fix uneven regional development can we do away with ‘illegal’ migration.”

A string of letters on the editorial positions of The Wire have come in. Interestingly, the criticism comes from different perspectives:

Hardik Parashar: “You call yourself an independent, unbiased news journalism platform and yet your views are entirely anti-government. Please don’t mislead people into thinking that your platform serves in unbiased ways because it’s a waste of time for all of us who seek news in its true form.”

Sreeni Nair: “I follow the articles on The Wire and find them good since many of the issues on which articles and stories are put on the site are often neglected by other media houses. But I fail to understand why you do not seem to notice an issue surrounding the priests in Kerala (priests and the Church). Is it because your media house is afraid of annoying the minority community or afraid of the influence of the Church. You must have seen that the victims, in this case, are hapless poor women and by choosing to ignore such stories you seem to become one-sided in your approach, which is to remain merely anti-establishment.”

Mohammed Irfan Khan: “We the audiences have been following The Wire for its honest and fearless Journalism but the article published on June 23 against Dr Zakir Naik (‘Zakir Naik Is Anathema to Secular Democracy, His Communal Agenda Must Be Halted’) is absolutely untrue and seems to be influenced by the author’s personal beliefs about religion. The very first thing the author manages to say against Dr Zakir Naik was to comment on his attire rather than any substantial action or speech. This is clearly because there is nothing to prove against Dr Zakir Naik. Even a multicultural society such as Malaysia gave him permanent residency because they understand very well the current mindset of the government in power which is creating as much hate as it can against the minorities and depicting them as anti-nationals and terrorists.”

Currently, river Brahmaputra at Nimatighat in Jorhat, Dikhow at Sizasagar town, Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat and Jia Bharali at NT Road Crossing in Sonitpur are flowing above the danger mark. The water level in the Yamuna river rose to over 206 metre yesterday. On Monday, the Kerala government had issued an orange alert” in three districts as the water in Idukki reservoir came close to full storage level. It has sad that it would issue a “red alert” if the water-level reached a certain level, according to Indian Express report.

Generally three types of colours are used for issuing alert- “Orange”, “red” and “yellow alert”. The Central Water Commission uses this colour-coded system to alert local people in case of emergency. There are over 700 flood forecasting stations located across the country and a defined “warning level”, “danger level” and “highest flood level” for the river on which it is situated, the report says. The “warning and danger levels” are generally kept fixed for a river. However, highest flood level keeps changing and alteration is done based on the prevuious year’s record.

The colour-coded system works on the basis of the amount of water that flows in a river at a particular time. When the water in a river is “above normal flood” level, or between the warning and danger levels, a yellow alert is issued. When the river is in “severe flood”, or the level is between the danger and highest flood levels, authorities concerned issue “orange alert”. Authorities issue a red alert when the waters breach the highest flood level, the IE report said.

In Delhi, Yamuna was flowing at over 206 metre on Tuesday noon with the danger mark being 204.83 metres, officials said. The highest water level recorded at Old Yamuna Bridge was 207.49 metres in 1978. It was 207.11 metres in 2010 and 207.32 metres in 2013, according to the Delhi Disaster Management Authority.",flood,2022 North India Floods,North India,June 2022,Present,"['Brahmaputra at Nimatighat in Jorhat', 'Dikhow at Sizasagar town', 'Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat', 'Jia Bharali at NT Road Crossing in Sonitpur', 'Yamuna river in Delhi']","['100 mm to 200 mm', '200 mm to 300 mm', '300 mm to 400 mm', '400 mm to 500 mm', 'Above 500 mm']","['Damage to infrastructure', 'Loss of crops', 'Displacement of people', 'Loss of livestock', 'Loss of life']","['10', '20', '30', '40', '50']","['Economic loss', 'Environmental damage', 'Social disruption', 'Health problems', 'Psychological trauma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

It will be helpful for every state authority to take decision. We can run this system in pre-event scenario. We are now in a position to put this technology into service.”

Ramesh also said that the number of cyclones have increased from 10 to 18 every year as reported in Nature Magazine and also noted that the quantum of precipitation, which was 13 days, has come down to 10 days. He pointed to another technology which would help in identifying warm ocean segments that are contributing to the rapid intensification of the systems. “Cyclone Ockhi’s unpredictability was due to such warm ocean segments, following which the technology was developed in October,” he said.

Heavy downpour had devastating impacts on Kerala in August, which left 500 dead and caused economic damages worth Rs 40,000 crores. Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan had said in the state assembly that there were “lapses” on the part of the IMD’s rain forecast.

CSE Director General Sunita Narain stressed on the need to plan “deliberately for drainage” to prevent disasters like Kerala floods. “Every river, pond, paddy field and city should be mapped and protected at all costs.

The monsoon season is a dangerous and unsettling time in India, with most deaths reported from heavy rains and flooding in the four months of rain from June to September.

“Increasing trends in daily extreme precipitation in India have been observed during the recent 46 decades,” a recent paper said. “Moreover, urban areas in India have witnessed 47 eccentric precipitation extremes in the past, which have affected human lives and infrastructure.”

Between 1950 and 2017, India has reported 285 floods that have impacted 850 million people, left 19 million homeless and killed about 71,000. In the past decade, flood damage has led to losses of US $ 3 billion every year, according to the International Disaster Database.

But it is the short bursts of extreme precipitation that has scientists worried. Such events may boost the total amount of rainfall but they do not necessarily reduce water stress or significantly recharge the water table. On the contrary, much of the rain discharge is difficult to manage and often causes flash floods, which is detrimental to infrastructure.

Incidences of extreme rainfall, that precipitates flooding, are projected to increase as the planet warms. India is not just highly prone to weather-related disasters, its high population density and poor infrastructure also puts its people at higher risk. In the last two years alone, 25 million people have suffered impacts from heavy rains and floods and at least 2,000 people have died in these episodes.

In India, both large-scale floods from continuous heavy downpours and flash floods from sudden bursts of rain are expected to strike more often.

“A warming climate will cause more intense and more frequent extreme rain events,” Vimal Mishra, a climate scientist at IIT Gandhinagar, said. The increase in rainfall extremes is being driven by anthropogenic warming, Mishra and his colleagues said in a 2018 paper, noting that in the worst case scenario of unchecked greenhouse gas emissions, such events will increase significantly over south and central India by 2050.

“For cities, daily rainfall data is not that helpful, even 5-10 minutes of heavy rain can flood a city and pose a risk to the infrastructure,” Mishra said. Which is why the scientist is calling for improving understanding of sub-daily rainfall patterns that include rainfall spurts over less than 24 hours.”There isn’t enough focus on sub-daily rainfall events,” he said.

A paper by Mishra and his team showed that such short duration rainfall events that can trigger flash floods are even more sensitive to warming temperatures than 24-hour rainfall extremes. If there is an increase in average temperatures of 1 degree Celsius, there would be a greater increase in the events of sub-daily rainfall extremes than daily extremes.

The researchers found that the frequency of such events would increase by 20% if global temperature rises by 1.5 degrees Celsius and by 25% if they increase by 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial level.

Other researchers have reached similar conclusions about widespread extreme rains that causes flooding.

“We looked at the entire country and found a threefold increase in widespread extreme rain events over central India,” Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, said. “Barring a few pockets of the country, the country overall is likely to see an increase in such events.”

Widespread rainfall events that occur over multiple days and cover a large swathe of area (running into thousands of square kms) are known to cause large-scale floods. The 2005 Maharashtra flood on July 26 and July 27, which led to over 1,000 deaths across the state and brought Mumbai to a standstill, is an example of this.

When temperature increases, it raises the moisture-holding capacity of the atmosphere. Scientists have reported an increase in moisture content in the atmosphere over the Indian subcontinent.

While this may sound like good news, the distribution of the rain over space and time muddies such a straightforward understanding. More rain is not a blessing when it is dumped over short periods of time.

It’s not just local warming, but region-wide warming is having an impact on India’s rainfall patterns, according to Koll.

“It is not the local temperatures, warming that is not even exactly over the Indian subcontinent has resulted in more moisture availability,” he explained. “ It is coming from the Arabian Sea, so warming elsewhere will also impact extreme rainfall events over Indian subcontinent.”

Except this time, the water didn’t recede. Over the next 24 hours, it seeped its way into her home.

“That’s when we decided to take off. We placed our TV and other appliances on top of cupboards and stashed away Aadhaar, ration card and other documents in a safe place and ran out of there. Somehow, we got into a car and came here,” says Velayudhan, who is on the eastern block of the school that’s reserved for women. Follow LIVE UPDATES Here

The school is one of 2,094 relief camps operating across the state and is one of the biggest such in Ernakulam district. The camp began taking in people from Makkaparambu, Nikathil and Perandoor on the afternoon of August 15, when water began seeping onto the main roads from the Perandoor canal, a natural waterway linking the Periyar river to the Arabian Sea. By Friday evening, however, the school with 45 classrooms had become home to more than 1,200 people, with dozens more surging in. Besides this camp, there are four others in Elamakkara that together account for 850 people. Tracking the unfolding tragedy in Kerala, from Ernakulam to Thrissur

Official sources say the flooding in Elamakkara has been due to the release of water from dams in Idamalayar, Cheruthoni and Mullaperiyar into the Periyar river. Since the Perandoor canal, which flows through Kochi, is linked to the Periyar, water surges into areas such as Elamakkara.

“This has never happened before. People are naturally scared to see water entering their homes,” said Ravikuttan, the local councillor overseeing arrangements at the camp. He soon calls the headmistress of a nearby school, asking for keys to open the classrooms. “Teacher, our camp at the government school is already full. Please open the classrooms for us. We have to open a sixth camp,” he says.

Valsala, 56, also a resident of Makkaparambu, recalls how her family of five, including her four-year-old granddaughter whom she carried on her shoulders, left all their belongings behind in their flooded, home. “Motham poyi (Everything’s gone),” she cries out. “We ran out of our homes, without even taking spare clothes. We have seen such visuals on TV before and we have cried out ayyo (oh). But it’s only when tragedy strikes us that we realise how terrifying it can be,” says Valsala, who sells lottery tickets with her husband.

As darkness falls, the tubelights in the corridors and classrooms light up. In the men’s wing of the camp, a few of them debate whether they should return to their homes to take stock of the situation. A group of younger men discuss if they should take a shower. “I really, really need a bath, but I can’t do it here in the school toilet. Should we try the washroom in the other school?” a teenager asks his friend.

By 7 pm, the school is teeming with people, who are roaming the corridors and spreading out mats inside the classrooms. Tea and snacks get distributed. Outside, as it rains incessantly, families continue to arrive and register themselves with a local official posted at the camp. On arrival, they are each given straw mats, bed-sheets, pillows, dhotis, undergarments, sanitary napkins and toothbrush-soap-toothpaste kits.

“Most of the essential supplies have been coming to us from private organisations and individuals. We are not worried about stocks at all because we have enough stuff until Sunday,” says a CPM worker who is overseeing the registration at the camp.

Even as reports emerge of relief camps in areas such as Aluva and Paravur complaining of lack of supplies, camps such as this one in Elamakkara have been overflowing with relief materials, pointing to an uneven distribution of supplies. By 8 pm, volunteers bring out steel plates and utensils and place them on a table, beside large vessels filled with rice, sambar, boiled black gram and papad. Food supplies to the neighbouring camps too are sent from this high school. Soon, there are long queues for dinner. Pregnant women and those with infants take their plates to the classrooms. In another corner, boiled eggs and small cups of hot milk get passed on.

Post dinner, people begin making their way back to the classrooms. Pregnant women, aged people and children find space on benches while the others sleep on the floor on mats.

A floor below, in one of the rooms, people line up for medicines for common ailments — headache, toothache and backache — as the nurse prepares to leave.

Outside the medical room, Dileep Kumar, the lone police officer at the camp, stretches himself. An officer should have replaced him by now, but he doesn’t know when that’ll happen. “I’m used to long nights so it doesn’t matter,” he says, listening to news of the floods on his cell phone. “This was bound to happen. This is all because of encroachment,” he says.

As the clock strikes 11, the entire camp is silent, except for the pitter-patter of the rain striking the wet soil.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Isro's satellites and radars played a key role during the recent monsoon crisis in Kerala. Their predictions helped local authorities in putting into place safety measures, according to the space agency, on Wednesday.

It said that Isro not only extended support through its space-based assets, but ground-based sensors as well.

Idukki, Pathanamthitta, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Palakkad received more than the expected rainfall, which was a deviation by more than 164 per cent, Isro stated, quoting the IMD. In just the first 20 days of August, Kerala received the highest rainfall for the entire month in 87 years. Idukki district broke a 111-year record for the highest rainfall for the month. This caused floods in several parts of the state.

Two of Isro's radars, a C-band polarimetric Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) located at the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launch Station (Terls), Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, and an S-band DWR at Kochi monitored the weather 24X7 up to 500 km. These radars were installed by the radar development area of Isro's telemetry tracking and command network, (Istrac), Bengaluru.

Advertisement The data gets transferred to the IMD and the Meteorological and Oceanographic Data Archival Centre (Mosdac) of Isro's Space Application Centre (SAC), immediately after what is known as each ""volume scan"" for further data analysis and centralised weather monitoring.

According to Isro, the data was made available in real time for the public through the Mosdac and IMD websites. Isro states these radars helped in long-range weather surveillance in Kerala.

The National Disaster Management Authority and the Kerala State Disaster Management authority were continuously monitoring the data received by the radar and the images were continuously updated on the IMD website.

According to Isro, the DWR system provides quantitative information in digital form, the intensity and mean velocity of cyclones along with the rainfall rate and accumulation. It improves the understanding and forecasting of thunderstorms, hailstorms, height of tidal waves, wind turbulence and what is known as shear. Data from these radars helped the civic officials in early evacuation.

By Y Maheswara ReddyWhen thetook up the construction of a culvert, residents of HAL 2nd Stage were overjoyed, but their excitement was short-lived, thanks to the slow progress of the work. The work was taken up to prevent flooding of houses (at 16th B Main) close to the storm water drain.Residents now complain emanating stench from the drains is making life hell for them. The ongoing culvert work is hampering the flow of water and the drain looks like a mini-lake, filled with silt and slush.“I think no norms are being followed by the contractor while building the culvert. First of all, the BBMP did not float a tender inviting bidders for the project. BBMP engineers told us the work would be completed in 45 days, but it is incomplete even after three months,” said a shop owner, seeking anonymity.Residents also question the logic in connecting the new culvert without removing silt and debris from the old one. They want authorities to allocate funds for cleaning the old culvert to ensure smooth flow of water. “What is the use in constructing the new one when it is not serving the purpose? Rain water floods homes when it rains heavily,’’ says a resident.According to Dr R U Raju, a resident, the silt was removed from thedrain two decades ago. “Now, authorities have engaged a contractor to remove the silt but the work is far from satisfactory,” said Dr Raju.A V Krishnamurthy, an auditor and consultant, said authorities have failed to ensure even basicin the locality. “Authorities have to focus on lifting garbage on a daily basis and also ensure water supply to all homes. Many residents are not getting potable water,’’ said Krishnamurthy.Chandrasekhar, assistant Engineer, SWD, BBMP, said the construction of the culvert has been taken up with the surplus funds allocated for New Thippasandra ward. “The culvert is being constructed with estimated cost of Rs 15 lakh. I am aware of the delay in completing the work. I thinkthe contractor will complete the work within 10 days,’’ said Chandrasekhar.

More than 350 people have already died in Kerala—the state that is battling one of the worst floods in the recent history. Experts have suggested that this latest deluge is not entirely of nature’s making, putting the blame on faulty dam management. The state threw open dozens of dams when water reached danger levels, flooding the nearby regions at a much faster rate than expected. Questions have been raised as to why did the authorities wait till the last moment and then open all the gates at one go.

While the state now turns its focus on rescue operations and rehabilitation drives as the water level recedes, it is imperative to check if the mistakes that landed the state in such distress were few or several and recent or repetitive.

Here are a set of questions, the answers to which will tell us how prepared was Kerala, in fact, the entire country, when it comes to dam safety or floods. This analysis is based on audit reports prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).

How much did we allocate and spend on dam safety?

Last year’s CAG audit said that “a central sector scheme, namely ‘Dam Safety Studies and Planning’, was introduced during XIth Plan with a total provision of Rs 10 crore, which was subsequently revised to Rs 6 crore”. Against this allocation, the CAG audit tells us that “expenditure of Rs 4.22 crore was incurred during the XIth Plan”.

Subsequently, this scheme was subsumed in another scheme titled Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP), which was a state scheme with a central component being implemented in the Central Water Commission (CWC). DRIP envisaged rehabilitation of 223 existing dams and institutional strengthening on the front of dam safety in four states, namely Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Tamil Nadu. The Dame Safety Rehabilitation Directorate within Dam Safety Organisation of CWC was tasked with the overall responsibility for the project oversight and coordination of DRIP.

How committed were state governments in preparing Emergency Action Plan?

“As per Crisis Management Plan for Dam Failures (March 2011) prepared by National Committee on Dam Safety of the Union Ministry, several state governments were asked to come out with Emergency Action Plan for each of its large dams,” said a CAG audit report. It’s also shocking that CWC had prepared the guidelines for ‘Development and Implementation of EAPs for Dams’ in May 2006 and had circulated it to state governments for action. So this communication dated March 2011 as per Crisis Management Plan for Dam Failures, suggests that five long years lapsed between May 2006 and March 2011, without state governments taking much action on preparing EAP.

Were EAP and Operation & Maintenance (O&M) Manuals prepared for dams in Kerala?

A table in the performance audit report shows that out of 61 dams, none had Emergency Action Plan or O&M Manuals. Kerala had also stated, in response to audit query from CAG of India, “No dam-break analysis was conducted in respect to any of the 61 dams in the state.”

What is the extent of flood-prone area in Kerala?

The Rashtriya Barh Aayog (RBA) had estimated 8.70 lakh hectares as flood prone area out of 38.90 lakh hectares of geographical area in Kerala. The CAG report also says that Kerala was amongst those six states whose estimation of flood prone areas was taken up by regional committees for scientific assessment.

Why didn’t the Central Water Commission establish a single flood forecasting station in Kerala?

“The CWC has not established any flood forecasting stations in 15 states and union territories. The list included: Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Dam and Diu, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Lakshadweep, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Puducherry, Punjab, Rajasthan and Sikkim,” said the auditors.

The fact that those agencies which are responsible for disaster preparedness only indulge in the blame game again puts a question mark on if we should believe the statement of an unnamed official of CWC in this news story.

How much central assistance did Kerala get under the Flood Management Programme?

During the XIth Plan period, four FMP were approved in Kerala, with an estimated cost of Rs 279.74 crore, and against this Rs 63.68 crore were released during the XIth Plan and another Rs 55.22 crore during the XIIth Plan. So, Kerala got Rs 118.90 crore as against the estimated cost of Rs 279.74 crore.

Were there deficiencies in project proposals for Flood Management Programme in Kerala?

CAG auditors note that they didn’t come across any specific project proposals for FMP, KEL-1, KEL-2, KEL-3 and KEL-4. The audited entity tried to justify this on the ground that DPRs were prepared in 2009 and 2010 based on the recommendation from the study report of M S Swaminathan Research Foundation for another project approved in principle by Government of India in July 2008. Representing the audited entity’s view, the CAG report states, “Detailed Project Reports were prepared based on hydrological survey, meteorological data collection and engineering surveys including total station surveys and scientific study reports furnished by joint team of IIT, Chennai, and Centre for Water Resources and Development Management, Kozhikode. The Water Resources Department, Kerala also stated, in a reply, dated June 2016 that “the soil investigation for project KEL-2 was conducted by Kerala Engineering Research Institute, Peechi”.

Having taken on record the reply by audited entity, CAG audit report goes on to say, “We, however, found that the above said study was conducted for another project for which final reports were submitted to Government of Kerala in December 2011, after the DPRs for the projects KEL-1, KEL-2, KEL-3 and KEL-4 had already been prepared (2009/2010). Further, the study report on soil investigation was also submitted only in December 2012 after preparation of DPRs”.

And then comes a concluding statement in the audit paragraph, “As such, the methodology for preparation of DPRs could not be verified”.

Were quality checks carried out by monitoring agencies with respect to FMP in Kerala?

The CAG audit observed that the prescribed quality checks were not conducted by monitoring agencies in 77 projects of seven states examined. This observation was applicable to all four projects in Kerala.

Let’s hope that CAG of India decides to carry out a specific performance audit of the Kerala Flood Disaster 2018.

devastating river floods have occurred in the past across the world, causing severe damage to life and property. Currently, 21 million people globally are affected by river floods every year (this figure may reach 54 million by 2030); India has the highest number of affected, at 4.84 million people, followed by China (3.48 million) and Bangladesh (3.28 million)—compare that to the US’s only 167,000. According to the World Resources Institute, 15 countries (least developed or developing) of the 169 countries surveyed account for 80% of the total number of people exposed to river floods in the world. The flurry of river floods during the last 2-3 decades has brought to the forefront the question: Are dams causing floods? The recent floods in Kerala seem to strengthen that view.

To my mind, this may not be true—because traditionally dams are considered as providing protection against floods, along with other benefits like generation of electricity (clean energy), irrigation and recharging of groundwater, etc, for socio-economic development of a country. Thus, it’s necessary to examine carefully, and scientifically, the real causes of river floods. Let’s assume that dams do cause floods. Then, should we put a moratorium on construction of dams and explore other alternatives to fulfil our requirements that dams are meeting today?

Suppose we do that in India, then what next? Taking the example of compensating for electricity generation, which dams provide us currently, we have to further enhance production of solar and wind energy—which we can do as there is abundant sunshine and wind in India, though at the cost of huge investment and the long time required. But can we be sure that solar and wind energy will not lead to any harmful effects in the future?

The answer is ‘no’. Today’s boon can become tomorrow’s bane—consider Industrial Revolution of the 19th century or the invention of plastic. Are we not stuck here? Let’s now discuss the other side of the story—that dams cannot be blamed for floods. Then, the question arises: What exactly is causing an increasing number of river floods? Researchers, scientists and environmentalists, after thorough investigation, have noted there are three main reasons for the same:

First, water in reservoirs of dams, at times, is allowed to be filled to the brim, so that there is no shortage of water for electricity-generation. And when there is a sudden downpour—which is increasingly happening in this era of climate change—the gates are suddenly thrown open to save dams from destruction. This is what happened in Kerala, where of the more than 50 dams, gates of about 30 dams, including of the large Idukki Dam, were thrown open. It should be understood that water has to be released intermittently, and for this it is necessary that advanced warning about heavy rains is provided to dam managers by the meteorological department and other weather forecasting agencies.

Second, there is total disregard for the environment while carrying out infrastructure development or developing human habitat, alongside fragile river banks and basins. Here, it appears we are not taking sufficient measures to ensure that proper drainage system is kept intact—it includes maintenance of the system and regular de-silting, so that excess water can be easily stored and channelised all the time. The recent deadly floods in Uttarakhand and J&K can be attributed to these reasons.

Third, unregulated and rampant mining—which destroys forests and leads to soil erosion—aggravates the occurrence of river floods. In Kerala, landslides, degraded soil and debris deposits due to quarrying and sand mining contributed substantially to the damage due to floods. Here, it must be mentioned that a report—by a committee headed by ecologist Madhav Gadgil in 2011—had warned that mining and hydropower dams are threatening the ecologically-sensitive areas of the Western Ghats because of reckless resource extraction, but, alas, the report was junked. Also, a government-backed report in June 2018, asserting that Kerala was at the risk of a big disaster, was not heeded to. Many districts in Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka, falling in the Western Ghats region, are other cases in point that have been badly affected in not too distant past by river floods. The above findings suggest that it is not dams, as such, but there are other reasons, as discussed, that are causing devastating floods. In view of this, measures need to be taken on a war-footing by central and state governments so that disaster due to floods can be sufficiently reduced:

Streamline and strengthen weather forecasting system about occurrence of heavy, long-duration rainfall (including cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes and other types of storms or tsunami) in this age of climate change, when sudden, extreme and variable weather conditions are the ‘new normal’;

Take into account the fragile ecology of various regions, states, towns while carrying out construction and mining activities, and pay heed to the advice of researchers in this respect;

As the flood situation continued to deteriorate in the state, as many as 33 dams have opened their shutters to release excess water due to heavy rain.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan again Thursday morning and assured to provide full assistance to combat the severe flood situation.

“We discussed the flood situation in the state. Have asked Defence Ministry to further step up the rescue and relief operations across the state. Praying for the safety and well-being of the people of Kerala,” the PM tweeted.

# The Cabinet Secretary chaired a high-level meeting on PM Modi’s instructions to oversee the rescue and relief operations in Kerala. The Army, Navy, IAF, Coast Guard and NDRF have been asked to mobilise additional manpower, boats and helicopters to scale up the operations. Food packets and drinking water are also being rushed.

# The Central Water Commission will be monitoring the situation at Mullaperiyar dam in view of rising water level and continued heavy inflow of rainwater. The Kerala Chief Minister’s Office said they are releasing water whenever it reaches the highest storage level. In other areas, water is being released from dams in phases before it breaches the limit. “We have been releasing water from dams in different stages since beginning considering the extreme weather situation but Mullaperiyar dam was released only after it touched 142 ft, leading to intensified water discharge and impact. In Kuttanad, we are anticipating a rise in water level, also in areas like Ernakulam, Alappuzha, Chengannur,” the CMO said.

Kerala is now fighting against water-borne diseases like leptospirosis and hepatitis A. With hospitals and other infrastructure damaged beyond immediate repair, the road to recovery is slow and painful.

Since the onset of the southwest monsoon on June 1, some 370 people have died and over 725,000 have been displaced. As rehabilitation continues, it is believed the full extent of the crisis is yet to be understood.

Nagaland, at the other end of the country, is now witnessing one of the worst floods to have hit the state. Twelve people have already died and 3,000 people have been displaced. Officials say that at least 48,000 people, or 13% of the state’s population, are already affected.

If floods of this intensity had struck anywhere in the country a few decades back, they would have been among the worst in history. Now, the one in Kerala was simply the worst in Kerala’s history. When the Tamil Nadu floods happened in 2015, they were the worst in the city for over a century. Such disasters are also becoming more common. The 2014 floods in Srinagar left 160 people dead. During the 2013 floods in Uttarakhand, some 5,700 people were presumed dead. Cloudbursts in Ladakh killed 234 people in 2010. In 2005, Mumbai came to a standstill when it received more 994 mm of rain in a 24-hour period.

Each flood is also worse than the previous one. For 53 years before 1996, the average annual damage caused by floods amounted to Rs 1,805 crore. Between 1996 and 2005, this number shot up 1.5x to Rs 4,745 crore, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

While climate change can’t be held responsible for the individual flood or heatwave, their increasing frequency suggests the climate today is not what it was before. Together with a burgeoning population, rapid urbanisation and haphazard development on floodplains, the country’s resilience to climate vagaries have weakened, experts say.

To deal with this problem, two things need to be done: reduce carbon emissions as a country and as a planet, while improving climate resilience by protecting the forests, floodplains and water bodies. While Kerala leads the country in the former, it remains guilty of not doing the latter.

What India can learn from Kerala

Kerala and Jammu & Kashmir are the only two states in the country to have reduced their per capita emissions to become “net removers of CO2” in 2013, according to a report by GHG Platform India, a civil society initiative. It states that the achievements will “need further, deeper analysis, and might provide clues on how to pursue an economic development strategy that is not necessarily linked to inevitably higher GHG emissions.”

Apart from better awareness among the local politicians and bureaucrats, the state also manages its solid waste (collection, segregation and disposal) better than most states, according to the report: about 35% of the waste generated is segregated and 34.3% is disposed into landfills designed to prevent leaching.

Some experts say that state-wise data need to be looked with a pinch of salt. “While Kerala may have lower emissions compared to some other states because of the lesser number of industries, it imports lots of products from other states including electricity. The emissions from these imports are not accounted in the state’s emissions,” Chandra Bhushan, the deputy director of the Centre for Science and Environment, New Delhi, said.

Officials said that nearly one-third of the state is covered with forests and about half with greenery, including agricultural lands and plantations. Additionally, according to P.H. Kurian, additional chief secretary to the Government of Kerala, there were also fewer manufacturing units and thermal power plants. Kurian oversaw rescue and relief operations during the floods.

More greenery does not mean a better environment

But nearly half the state being green still does not mean the state is off the hook. When forests are cleared for plantations, the green cover is not recorded as having been reduced. But unlike in forests, the soil under a plantation loses its ability to hold water, causing runoffs and flooding. In other words, while forests and plantations both figure as ‘green’ in official data, they don’t have the same effects. The problem becomes worse when houses are built on floodplains or when water bodies are encroached upon.

“The floods gave us a reality check on what happens when houses are built on water bodies. This is the right time for the government to come out with a progressive land use policy,” Kurian said. “Ten years back, the people would have not agreed to it, but now people have seen the consequences. We will hold wider consultations with different stakeholders to come up with a policy with a long-term to rebuild Kerala.”

But experts believe the volume of rain Kerala has received in 2018 would have flooded the state even if its landscape had been left untouched. “However, the intensity and the loss of lives and houses would have been much lesser,” Chandra Bhushan,, said.

Compiling data from Kerala’s Department of Economics and Statistics, he drew a comprehensive picture of the state’s changing landscape. “Some 70,000 hectares of land was diverted for housing and infrastructure since 2005-06. The state has lost more than four lakh hectares of natural forests and more than 2.5 lakh hectares of wetlands in the last five to six decades,” he said.

According to Kamal Kishore, a member of the NDMA, Kerala is not alone in diverting lands for housing and infrastructure development and making urban areas more vulnerable to climate disasters. “Cities have an unquenchable thirst for land. However, very little regard [has been] given to integrating hazard maps in our development paradigm,” he explained. “There is very little premium on safety in the long term.”

Since the 2015 floods in Tamil Nadu, the NDMA has trained its eyes on disaster and climate resilience in urban areas around India. It has set up a taskforce to come up with short-, medium- and long-term action plans to prepare cities for extreme weather events.

The taskforce issued a urban floods roadmap in May 2017 for all states to follow. For heatwaves, the process is underway, per Kishore. “The first guidelines were finalised in 2016 and were later revised in 2017. Last week, we had a meeting to look at how it was used,” he said. India, so far, has no guidelines for thunderstorms, lightning and squalls. “The guidelines for these will be finalised within the next three months,” he added.

He also pointed out that building approvals should be limited to those able to “counter the hazards they may face” and that municipal engineers, as among the last lines of defence, will need to be empowered to perform this screening function.

Central Kerala has seen the biggest changes in land use in the last few decades. Between Thrissur in the south and Kollam in the north, at least six rivers drain into the Vembanad estuary in central Kerala. All their flow lies impeded today. “Dams built in the 1970s changed everything. Dammed rivers with reduced water flow prompted construction in low-lying areas,” K. Soman, a former scientist of the National Centre for Earth Science Studies, Thiruvananthapuram, said. “Any rain would flood them.”

“Even the Kochi airport was built on the wetlands of the Periyar river. With such poor planning, what else can we expect apart from flooding?”

Changing landscape, shifting monsoons

A 2008 study co-authored by Soman had found that the ‘average’ time of peak rainfall in the state had shifted to October in 1994-2004 from June in 1855-2014. “The rains are shifting, and we are still yet to find out the long-term consequences on flooding and agricultural patterns,” Soman said.

Others agree and say that the change has been noticeable. “Typically, Onam comes as the southwest monsoon tails off towards the end of August or early September. The days are brighter and it rains less. It’s a good time for boat races and celebrations,” Suprabha Seshan, a member of the Gurukula Botanical Sanctuary in Wayanad, said. “However, we are now seeing wetter Augusts.”

The 70-acre sanctuary was nurtured over the years by partly dismantling tea plantations and growing native species of trees and plants. “For several years, the monsoon has been setting in later with each year. In June 2016, we had two weeks of dry and sunny weather. With the evapotranspiration from the forests and the onset of the monsoon, June should have been a wet month,” she said.

Deforestation is understood to have a hand in precipitating this shift, and certainly exacerbates the effects of the resulting flooding. “Just like the trees need the rains, the rains also need the forests. Each blade of grass is an individual water tower. Vegetation helps in the formation of rain clouds. Without forests, the soil cannot hold rainwater and this causes flooding in areas downhill,” she explained.

As Kerala continues to fight its battle against water-borne diseases, Nagaland is just taking baby steps towards fundraising. Normalcy is a long way away for both states.

The flood, they say, came as a cumulative result of climatic, environmental and human factors, playing out in the atmosphere, oceans near and far, and terrains high and low.

As for the climatic factors, scientists agree that the magnitude and frequency of flooding will increase with a warming climate across the world. However, the characteristics of floods differ locally over different geographic features.

In the past 30 years, there has been an overall increase in both the frequency and magnitude of extreme floods. In India, the examples of extreme floods – that came amidst a trend in extreme rain events – include the events in Mumbai (2005 and 2017), Barmer (2006), Uttarakhand (2013), Kashmir (2014) and Chennai (2015).

Low pressure

In the short term, it is low-pressure systems over northwest Bay of Bengal that caused heavy rains in Kerala, as director of the Meteorological Centre in Thiruvananthapuram K. Santosh explained. “Strengthening of the monsoon flow due to the formation of the low-pressure system has caused widespread intense rainfall activity over south peninsular India,” he told indiaclimatedialogue.net.

Wind flows to low-pressure areas and brings rain. Low pressure over the Bay of Bengal is a normal phenomenon during the monsoon. However, this time there were several such formations, contributing to continued rain, Santosh explained. Wind flows from the Arabian Sea towards the land, and the Western Ghats catches it, causing rainfall.

The state has received over 40% more rain than average since June 1, the starting point of monsoon. However, on certain days in places such as Wayanad, the rain was many times the normal level.

Along with low-pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal, wind over the Arabian Sea, and remote influences such as storms in the Pacific have contributed to the current scenario, scientists at the Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) said. “There have been several low-pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal since May, and strong wind over the Arabian Sea for many days,” said Abhilash S., assistant professor at the CUSAT Department of Atmospheric Sciences, told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “Monsoon is a highly complex system that scientists have yet to fully understand. It is influenced by several atmospheric and oceanic phenomena.”

Weather forecasters often find it difficult to factor in oceanic influences, due to very little direct observation facilities offshore. On shore, fishers have said that the wind patterns in the Arabian Sea have been worrying. Jerome John, a middle-aged fisherman in Anchuthengu village near Thiruvananthapuram, said that his crew could not launch boats since August 14 due to strong winds. “The wind has been very strong even before, and we missed a lot of fishing days.”

Amidst this unusual weather, C.K. Rajan, former director of CUSAT Centre for Monsoon Studies, acknowledged that Kerala’s monsoon regime has been undergoing changes over the past decade and a half. “The shift became more pronounced this time,” he pointed out. The usual period of monsoon is June to September, but this time heavy rains have stared right from May. Rajan blames it on the larger trend of climate change that is changing rainfall patterns across the world. However, scientists often caution against attributing a single event to climate change.

Environmental factors

In the case of Kerala floods, many scientists have been quick to point at the environmental factors as well. Their explanation is that between the Earth’s surface and atmosphere, water exists in abundance and is available to us as rain, moisture (intercepted by forests), in rivers, groundwater, and the larger share in oceans. Floods are linked to these different points in the water cycle.

Scientists, including Madhav Gadgil, former professor and founder of the Centre for Ecological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, have noted that rampant forest destruction over the Western Ghats has contributed to the disaster in Kerala.

“Mountains and forests play an important role to intercept those tiny water molecules hanging in the air called moisture,” explained Nandakumar D., former professor of geography at University College, Thiruvananthapuram, and senior advisor, climate change and environment at the non-profit Intercooperation Social Development. “Whenever the weather conditions (such as temperature, humidity, pollens and dust and other parameters) are ripe, this moisture condenses (and is too heavy for the air to hold it anymore) and gravity brings it down as precipitation. So do the copious leaves of the canopy too where the moisture condenses on their smooth surfaces.”","

Kerala Floods — The Human Story, to be beamed from 9pm, highlights some of the deluge’s most poignant stories about the rescue operations by fishermen, altruism shown by ordinary people and the solidarity among different religious communities.

Within days of the onset of the state’s worst floods since 1924, Discovery had deployed its camera crews across Kerala.

“We placed four camera units on the ground to capture live images,” Zulfia Waris, vice-president and head of Premium Digital Networks of Discovery Communications India, told The Telegraph.

“The documentary features brave rescue operations like the one involving the fully pregnant Fajitha Jabil.”

Fajitha, a 25-year-old housewife, was winched up by a navy helicopter from the roof of her home in Alva, Ernakulum, where floodwaters had reached the first floor.

First, the helicopter had sent down a doctor after being alerted about her pregnancy. Fajitha’s water broke before she was rescued. She delivered a boy, Subhan, within minutes of being taken to the naval hospital in Kochi.

Her grateful family painted “Thanks” on the roof for rescue choppers over-flying the house to see.

“The documentary is also about how people stood by each other irrespective of caste, class or religion,” Waris said.

More than 13 lakh displaced people were accommodated in about 2,800 relief camps, which offered them food, clothing, medical care and even counselling if they had suffered extreme mental trauma.

Temples, mosques and churches were thrown open for the flood-hit, and religious institutions placed their resources in the service of the displaced.

Hundreds of fishermen launched their own rescue missions and helped with relief, putting to good use their skill in manoeuvring rough waters.

“We have also focused on how the displaced returned home only to find their possessions, including important documents, washed away or destroyed,” Waris said.

One story missing from the documentary, however, is that of the chivalrous Jaisal K.P. from Malappuram, who had spontaneously got down on all fours to act as a footboard for a pregnant woman to climb into a rescue dinghy in Vengara.

Impressed with reports of the act, Mahindra group chairman Anand Mahindra had donated a Mahindra Marazzo SUV to the 32-year-old fisherman.

Eleven days of continuous rain since August 15 had burdened Kerala with nearly 25 trillion litres of water. The state had to release water from all its 61 dams as the reservoirs were flooded. The death toll crossed 450, counting the landslide victims.

The total damage is estimated at Rs 40,000 crore, with the state needing to rebuild more than 200 bridges, 35,000km of roads and about 1.74 lakh houses.

Researchers have established the extent of concretisation by comparing the spatial maps of the city over the years and contrasting them with the ground situation.The study says concretisation, narrowing of storm water drains, lack of appropriate drainage maintenance are resulting in urban floods -a phenomenon almost regular since the year 2000. If this trend continues, then 94% of Bengaluru will be concrete by 2020.Prof TV Ramachandra from the Centre for Ecological Sciences , IISc, who led the study , said lack of planning and enforcement of laws has resulted in significant narrowing of waterways. He said floodplains (areas next to waterbodies) had been consumed by illegal developments, further leading to flooding in the city.“Encroachment of floodplains, obstruction of sewer pipes, manholes, dumped construction material and solid waste have blocked the system,“ he added. Bellandur Lake -which sees fire, smoke and froth every second month as an example of how not to preserve a waterbody -finds a detailed mention in an IISc study on the factors that cause flooding in the city.The story around Bellandur Lake in east Bengaluru, cited in this study along with many others, drives home the point of concretization and narrowing of drains tellingly. At Jakkasandra village, which is upstream of Bellandur Lake, the main storm water drain has shrunk and 50% is concretized between 1908 and 2017, the study adds. Another highlight is 11.03sqkm Kaikondarahalli Lake , which joins downstream of Bellandur Lake. “This catchment is dominated by infrastructural (residential and commercial) establishments,“ the IISc report notes.The study, conducted with assistance by researchers Vinay S and Bharath H Aithal of IISc, says there was no need to concretize the channel of storm water drains as vegetation in these drains bears the load in peak monsoon. “Drains with vegetation and without any bottlenecks would be the best option to mitigate floods. Narrowing channels and concretizing will increase the quantum of water and velocity, which would be disastrous,“ it added.",issue,Bengaluru Floods,"Bengaluru, India",2019-07-07,2019-07-10,Bengaluru city,200 mm,Rs. 100 crore,10,Thousands of people were evacuated from their homes and many were stranded in their vehicles.

Study cites ORR and encroachments as significant reasonsMadiwala lake, with a watershed area of 71.74 sq km and a depth of 4.5 metres, starts swelling two hours after a rainfall of 72.3 mm per hour. In case of 161 mm per hour rainfall, the flooding time shrinks to just 90 minutes. However, the innundation is almost immediate from the direct incidence of rainfall on the tank, followed by a run-off from the catchment. The inflow is escalated due to a high run-off rate, poor percolation and loss of upstream tanks. The cascading effect will be innundation of Agara, Bellandur and Varthur lakes. And, the areas surrounding these water bodies bear the brunt of flooding. Year after year, it is almost the same localities that are suffering, going from bad to worse.Last year, the city saw massive demolition operations -- of properties built along the course of storm water drains hindering the flow of water. But sadly, the areas where the razing was carried out, were not spared of the worst flooding during the rainfall in the last two days. Encroachments, closure of natural water bodies, its wasteweir, mindless dumping in the drains, shoddy desilting/cleaning work done by civic authorities, are oft-heard reasons.Going a step further, it is tampering of Madivala, Agara, Bellandur and Varthur lakes and its connected valleys that is also strongly contributing to the watery situation we are in. Considering that the city’s lakes are interconnected, and these four water bodies in the east and south ofform a strong network, the closure of the catchment, embankments and valleys have had a cascading effect in the surrounding areas. A technical study carried out by environmental architect,, who did BMRDA’s structure plan for the city with assistance from civic activistsome months ago after the massive demolitionoperations, has brought out how construction of outer ring road on a narrow valley and letting of residue from the treatment plants into water bodies, are also the prime factors for Bengaluru’s watery doom.The study, titled “Urban flooding in Indian cities and natural drainage systems: The case of Bengaluru,” has dissected urban flooding and water scenario, with Bellandur and Madiwala tanks area as case studies. The study has also given workable solutions and the report is before every authority concerned, including the urban development department secretary and the BBMP commissioner.The study has sketched how the outer ring road that meanders along the areas where these water bodies are situated, is built on a narrow valley region enclosed by ridge formations that has resulted in a greater tendency for water to flow back and spread along the highway. The engineer who has dissected these lakes minutely has found that inflow has escalated, outflow is slower and the capacity of tank is lost. Take the case of Madiwala. It has a watershed area of 71.74 sq km with a depth of 4.5 metres with the original capacity being 3,542 ML. With this capacity, the lake will start flooding after two hours for a rainfall of 72.3 mm per hour. For a rainfall event of 161 mm per hour, it will start flooding after 90 minutes. The capacity of the tank is lost as it is already full with sewage discharged from adjacent areas, the report highlighted.With 940 ML pumped per day from theand 70 ML of ground water extracted per day, waste water adds to the discharge load on tanks locally. The treatment plants with a capacity of 740 MLD, results in additional load. “Several drains take 90-degree turns and tampering with their alignment has resulted in the flooding. If we play with nature and go against the drain’s natural path, as well as axe trees, what else can one expect? For decades, we have heard of BBMP’s plans to remodel 800 km of SWDs. But this work is slower than. The result is the city has sent organic manure (sewage), to people’s houses and gardens,” says Ravichandar.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown

Wary of downpour, residents of4th Block are buying boats so they can move to safety next time it rainsThey own some of the swankiest vehicles in the town, yet some Bengalureans are going in for a different kind of vehicle — a watercraft aka boat.Fed up and frustrated with the recent downpours and the subsequent flooding, Dr, a resident of Koramangala 4th Block, managed to bring home a three-seater rowboat last week — to be used by her family and her neighbours — in a crisis situation. She should know. Her lane — 5th cross, 8th A Main Road — is one of the worst affected during the recent rains. Sewage water entered homes and it took more than 24 hours for the flooded waters on the streets to recede.Stranded at home the day after rains and waiting for help, with children bunking schools and the elderly not able to move out even during medical emergency, Shalini, a pathologist, got the deflatable boat from a friend who is into adventure sports. And with the fickle weather, it did come handy: in the following days, it rained heavily and as usual, the lane and houses got flooded. Her children, who would have otherwise got stranded at home, used the boat to attend their tuitions.The good Samaritan she is, Shalini has spread the word in the neighbourhood that a “boat is available on call” instead of waiting for the fire personnel team to arrive and press their boats into action.Koramangala 4th Block, an upscale area, is one of the worst flooded during rains — as it is low lying and bears the cascading effect of the drain flowing through the 80 feet road, resulting in sewage overflow. “Whenever it rains, it’s hell out here. But life cannot come to a standstill and we have to move on instead of waiting for the stagnated water to dry up. Recently, children who could not afford to miss exams, carried an extra set of clothes, waded through muddy waters, changed in the school and wrote their exams. We have senior citizens in the colony who need to go out. I have a special child who has to be taken to the classes. It is very stressful for us and we had to find a way. My friend, who is into adventure sports, offered the boat. Soon, it rained and my children used the boat to attend their classes. I have spread the word around among neighbours to make use of the boat,” Shalini, a resident of the area for 21 years, told Bangalore Mirror.Rains have literally brought Koramangala 4th Block to the ground as its real estate stakes has gone for a toss after constant flooding. Rentals in the area too have dipped. If the same situation continues, experts warn that property prices may even crash in the coming months. For residents, expenses too have shot up as they have to hire the services of sump cleaners to pump out the dirty mess from tanks. “Just a spell of rain and we end up paying anywhere between Rs 900 and Rs 1,500 to sump cleaners per cleaning. We are paying through our nose and the infrastructure is just crumbling day by day,” laments Shalini.",solution,Koramangala Floods,"Koramangala, Bengaluru",2023-05-17,2023-05-19,['Koramangala 4th Block'],"['200 mm, 250 mm']","['Sewage water entered homes', 'Rentals in the area too have dipped', 'Property prices may even crash in the coming months', 'Expenses too have shot up as they have to hire the services of sump cleaners to pump out the dirty mess from tanks']",0,"['Children who could not afford to miss exams, carried an extra set of clothes, waded through muddy waters, changed in the school and wrote their exams', 'We have senior citizens in the colony who need to go out', 'I have a special child who has to be taken to the classes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Despite the magnitude of the rains, the damage due to flooding could have been much more if not for the city lakesThis year’s monsoon has broken all records and shows no signs of abating as yet. About half way through October, with 11 weeks to go before the end of the year, thehas already declared 2017 to be the wettest year of the past 115 years for which rainfall records exist. With more rain expected in the coming weeks,is gearing up for the challenge.A number of lakes have overflowed their banks, roads have flooded across the city, and apartment complexes and residential layouts are submerged – leading to tragedies of death, disease, and economic damage, coupled with nightmarish traffic, and major social and environmental trauma. As with every year’s monsoon, BBMP authorities are on the back foot, promising prompt action, while passing the buck to other agencies.In all the discussions about flooding, little attention is being paid to a surprising fact – despite the magnitude of the rains, the damage due to flooding could have been much heavier.For instance, many older residents will remember the heavy rains of 2005 and 2007 when Silk Board,and many other parts of the city were completely flooded, leading to devastating damage. Since then, sustained collective action by many of Bengaluru’s communities has led to the rejuvenation of many lakes. This protection has rejuvenated the capacity of lakes to act as large natural buffers against the monsoon – collecting the rainfall, diverting it into the soil to recharge depleted underground aquifers and wells, and ensuring that the city can store some water for the coming dry months.In south-west Bengaluru, in the areas of BTM, Koramangala, HSR Layout, Bellandur, and Whitefield, a number of lakes have been recently restored by the KLCDA, BBMP and, in collaboration with local residents. At the southern end of, a large additional catchment area, created recently, has helped absorb excess rainfall. Although areas near the lake flooded, this catchment limited the flooding that did take place, and protected the areas near Silk Board circle from heavy inundation.Downstream of Madivala Lake lies Agara Lake. This large lake, with a recorded history from the 9th century AD, was built to provide water for the domestic and agricultural needs of local villages. In a transformed urban landscape, it now serves another equally important function, acting as a buffer against floods. Dredged and rejuvenated this year, the lake was devoid of water just a few weeks ago. The bioremediation chambers built upstream, and the lake itself, have now filled almost to the brim.holds a massive volume of water – before dredging, the volume of the lake was much lower than it is now. The additional water that the lake now stores would have otherwise spread out across Koramangala and HSR, causing much greater destruction.In fact, one can contrast this situation with the now routine annual flooding faced by many parts of Ejipura and areas on the Koramangala Inner Ring Road near the Sony Signal. These areas flood every year during the rains because of the loss of two large lakes – the Srinivagilu Tank Bed (now ST) and(now the National Games Complex). With these lakes gone, and all the wetlands in Koramangala converted to concrete, the rain water that they used to storehas no place to go - instead flooding nearby roads and residences. Thankfully, sustained citizen activism was able to protect and restore one lake in Koramangala.Though a relatively small lake, the rejuvenation of Mestripalya Lake has brought some protection to neighbouring areas.A number of new homes, industries and large apartment complexes are located between Jail Road at the southern end of the city, and RMZ EcoSpace on the Outer Ring Road. While there has been substantial flooding on the outer ring road over the weekend, one shudders to think how much worse this would have been if not for recent lake rejuvenation. A large number of lakes have been dredged and desilted in this relatively small area - including Kudlu Chikka Kere, Kudlu Dodda Kere, Harlur Lake, Kasavanahalli Lake, Kaikondrahalli Lake, Sowle Kere and. The storm water channels connecting these lakes have also been cleaned, channelling the flow of water from one lake to another, and keeping the areas in between free of flooding.Halanayakanahalli Lake, a very large lake to the east of Kaikondrahalli, is full to the brim – this large lake, about 80 acres in area, was dry for most of the past decade. Last year, after sustained intervention from local residents, the connecting storm water channels were cleaned up, enabling water to flow into the lake. If it was not for this, all the surrounding areas would have been full of water. Similarly in Whitefield, Sadaramangala Lake – once threatened by land sharks – has now filled with rain water, protecting nearby residences and apartments from flooding. In contrast, many parts of Electronic City and Bommanahalli have faced the brunt of the rains, because of the loss of many wetlands, changes in topography and shrinking of lakes due to rampant construction. Similarly in Hebbal, flooding is because of the loss of the massive wetland on the east, which acted as an additional sponge absorbing excess rainwater. It is also exacerbated by the elevated outer ring road which blocks the path of water flow due to an ill-considered design.The lakes in Bengaluru were beautifully designed along an elevation gradient, so that in times of rainfall, all excess rain water could be smoothly channelled from one lake at a higher elevation, to the next adjacent lake at a lower elevation. When the storm water drains that channel water flow are missing, realigned and blocked, this leads to flooding even in areas adjacent to lakes. For instance, many of the roads adjacent to Halanayakanahalli have been built over drainage channels, leading to flooding in neighbouring areas. Parts of HSR layout have flooded because the storm water drains connecting Madiwala Lake to Agara Lake is blocked with trash.Similarly, the outflow channels from Sowle Kere and Doddakanalli Kere have become clogged, leading to flooding on the Outer Ring Road. Ironically, this is now being tackled by the efficient traffic police, who are employing JCBs to clean out the drains – an activity that the BBMP should have tackled before the onset of the monsoons.This year too, the rains will eventually pass, and life will return to normal in Bengaluru. People will forget about the monsoon – until next year’s rains. We must remember that we have entered the era of global warming, when extreme events will become the stuff of everyday life.Climate change models for India indicate that the length of the rainfall season is becoming compressed. Urban heat islands, caused by the increased concretisation of Bengaluru, further tend to stimulate cloud formation and rainfall. The combination of factors means that Bengaluru must prepare itself for more frequent periods of extreme, intense periods of rainfall – more rain squeezed into shorter periods of time. The deluge of today may be a rare event compared to trends of the past – but is likely to become an increasingly common feature of the future.Bengaluru’s lakes are its key to survival in such a future. Community effort has brought about a major change in the city. Yet there is still a long way to go. Many other lakes have to be restored, and a systematic effort needs to be made to clean up the storm water drains. Yet this is a time to draw attention to the importance of our lakes. For without them, the entire city would be awash in water.— Harini Nagendra is a Professor of Sustainability atUniversity.

302,1380,bangalore,2017,https://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/flood-rain-water-management-bangalore-21802,17 Oct 2017,Mitigating rain and floods in Bengaluru needs holistic approach,"Here is a drainage map of the city of Bengaluru sourced from the Central Ground Water Board website. No city sitting on a ridge line should actually get flooded but we have achieved the impossible — of course in parts.

A dotted ridge line divides the city between the Vrishabhavathy-Arkavathy-Cauvery basin and the Dakshina Pinakini, from the North to the South. There is a huge difference between these two in the slope, the hydro-geology, the soil, the rainfall, the built up area etc.

The drainage patterns – the rajkaluves – are interesting too. They are more dendritic in the Vrishabhavathy-Arkavathy-Cauvery basin and less so in the Dakshina Pinakini basin. Especially the North East of the city has a much flatter terrain and the slope and lake connections move West to East before they eventually join the Dakshina Pinakini and start sloping Southwards.

In the Western part of the city the slopes and hence the naalas – raj kaluves are more pronounced. During rains, water flows down streams more in the Cauvery basin while it gets collected and causes flooding more in the Dakshina Pinakini area.

The hydrogeology and hence the capacity of the aquifers to absorb water too is different in the two river basins. Groundwater is more abundantly available and the weathered zone hence recharge is better in the Cauvery basin than the Dakshina Pinakini basin. De-silted tanks should have better recharge in the Cauvery basin, while those in the Dakshina Pinakini will hold water longer and better.

Rainfall patterns too are incredibly localised as the tracking by the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Management Cell (KSNDMC) is showing us daily. Rain is more in the South and West of the city than the North and the East of the city, making the South and West more flood-prone than the North and the East.

Thus, in reality there are many Bengalurus for rainfall. The IMD centre in the heart of the city has recorded 1655.70 mm of rainfall. The rain gauge on our office in a suburb to the North of Bengaluru in Vidyaranyapura has recorded only 1002.80 mm a staggering 65% variation.

When we map out the flood affected areas with the various typology it will be helpful and useful. Underpasses getting flooded, neighbourhoods getting flooded, streams overflowing , lakes overflowing are all different typologies.

Let’s look at the example of how construction activities change the landscape and drainage patterns.

When a site is built up (assuming a flat site and normal rainfall in Bengaluru), a small one such as a 600 sq ft site, the hydrology of the site changes dramatically. From a run-off of 10 % it goes to 95 % or even 100 %. The big loser is soil moisture and evapotranspiration which, as expected, drops dramatically in an urbanised area.

How do we reverse this? If every plot is made responsible for the stormwater that it generates i.e. by holding to or recharging into a well every drop of rain that falls on the site, it will prevent flooding.

However, this depends on the ability of the aquifer to hold and transmit water. Sometimes the recharge rate can be low, sometimes transmissivity can be low, sometimes the weathered zone may be very small.

Thus when each micro-watershed is understood separately and jointly with the river basin, flood prevention will be better and systematically done. It is time we put up a citizens effort to understand and manage floods and we do it with the KSNDMC.",solution,2022 Bengaluru floods,"Bengaluru, India",15 May 2022,18 May 2022,"['Bengaluru city', 'Bengaluru rural district']","['1655.70 mm, 1002.80 mm']","['Damage to infrastructure', 'Loss of crops', 'Displacement of people', 'Loss of livestock']",17,"['Disruption of transportation', 'Water contamination', 'Health problems', 'Economic losses']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

In the southern Indian city of Bangalore, where April temperatures can reach up to 39 degrees Celsius (103 degrees Fahrenheit), the arrival of cooling monsoon rain is something to be celebrated.

But recently, the rain has resulted in another, less welcome phenomenon: toxic foam.

The white puffy foam, which carries with it a variety of health problems for residents – as well as a pungent and inescapable stench – began spilling out of Varthur Lake, located near the city’s busy Whitfield Road intersection, Saturday.

A protective wire fence had been erected around the foamy banks of the lake and nearby rivers, but proved of little use as the winds picked up, carrying the foam above the fence and onto the streets.

Varthur Lake is the second largest lake in Bangalore, which before becoming India’s technology capital was known as the “city of lakes”.

Health hazard

“The frothing in the lake clearly shows there is mismanagement. There is a sustained flow of untreated sewage and industrial waste going into the lakes,” said TV Ramachandra, coordinator of the Energy and Wetlands Research Group, at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore.

“When sewage gets into the water body, nutrients, in the form of nitrogen and phosphorus go in too. The nitrogen is taken by the plants in the water, while the phosphorus gets trapped in the sediment. The rainfall and the high wind velocity churn the lakes, and the phosphorus that is trapped in the sediment is released, creating the foam,”added Ramachandra.

According to Ramachandra, the toxic foam can result in respiratory and skin problems, as well as more serious health implications.

“The underground water has also become contaminated. Our studies show it has a high level of nitrate, which is a carcinogen,” he said.

“There are also heavy metals and with vegetables grown in the downstream area of the lake, we have seen a higher content of metal in the food that enters into the city.”

Lake on fire

Unfortunately for residents, foam is not the only substance pouring forth from the city’s lakes.

Bellandur Lake – the city’s largest – made headlines in February when it erupted into flames.

“The lake was covered with plants which started drying. People were dumping waste on top of this and when they set fire to the waste and plastic, the dry plant bacteria also caught on fire,” explained Ramachandra, who has been studying the city’s lakes since 1997.

He believes the fire spread rapidly because of traces of petroleum in the water.

“We noticed the color of the fire was orange and yellow, and when we analyzed samples, we found there was a high level of hydrocarbon, which is found in petroleum products.”

Soon after the fire, India’s National Green Tribunal – a special government-backed tribunal created to handle environmental issues – banned the dumping of municipal waste in and around Bellandur Lake.

Locals, however, continue to be frustrated with the lack of environmental regulations, with many taking to Twitter to express their frustration.

According to local media reports, Bengaluru’s Development Minister KJ George, met with concerned residents over the weekend and promised to provide a solution.

Ramachandra isn’t convinced, however. “There is a lack of sincerity. This problem could have been solved in two years. Unless there’s pressure from the judiciary, things don’t work.”",issue,Bangalore toxic foam flood,"Bangalore, India",2017-05-27,2017-05-29,"Varthur Lake, Bellandur Lake",heavy,unknown,0,"health hazard, environmental damage",caused by untreated sewage and industrial waste,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

306,1384,bangalore,2017,https://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/august-2017-rain-bangalore-floods-20915,16 Aug 2017,A watery Independence Day in S T Bed Layout,"Independence Day 2017 turned out to be a bright, sunny, yet cool, day – a typical Bengaluru day, it would appear. Yet, that morning we woke up to a rapidly flowing river outside our house that had completely submerged the main road leading into S.T. Bed Layout, Koramangala. A few hapless souls could be seen wading against the tide in at least a foot of water. Our compound was flooded, too. And murky water had entered many houses in more low-lying parts of the neighbourhood.

A walk around the area a little before noon on Tuesday revealed that some roads were still water-logged and garbage, as well as at least one dead rodent, was strewn here and there, carried along no doubt by the murky liquid that had obviously overflowed from the stormwater drain that borders the layout.

Further afield, on the bridge over the stormwater drain at the entrance to the layout, the authorities were belatedly at work with dredgers pulling out the accumulated pile of stinking garbage and debris that had been a huge, disgusting eyesore for weeks – and not for the first time. A local television channel had broadcast a story on the pathetic state of the drain just last month; residents who had gathered to speak to the crew had recounted to the media professionals (again, not for the first time) the long-standing problems with the drain, which carries everything but rain water most of the time.

Of course, irresponsible citizens are also to be blamed for dumping waste in large and small drains meant for rainwater, not connecting their buildings to sewage drains, and much else.

Over the past several months the authorities have allegedly been “remodelling” the section of the storm water drain bordering the layout, which passes through what is known as the Koramangala Valley. Many crores of rupees have been allocated to the project. The “retaining” walls built so far are not very reassuring, visibly weak and not even upright even now, when they are relatively new. A portion of it is already missing and could well have enabled the gushing water, mush and muck to flood the area today.

The fact that roadside drains are invariably clogged with garbage and sludge, despite efforts by at least some residents to keep them clean, adds to the problem. And, of course, the inevitable delays in undertaking pipe-laying and other such civic works that result in multiple roads being dug up simultaneously just before and during the rainy season – the situation in several parts of Koramangala at present – make things worse.

BDA’s original sin: Residential layout on a tankbed

The original sin (at least as far as this particular layout is concerned) was, of course, that the Bangalore Development Authority created a residential layout on what was originally a tank bed–one of the hundreds of tanks, or water bodies, that Bengaluru was blessed with, thanks (from most accounts) to the farsightedness of earlier rulers like Nadaprabhu Kempe Gowda who recognised that it was important to compensate for the fact that the city had no natural water source, like a river. The continued and continuing destruction of the natural drainage system, thanks to unbridled encroachment of and rampant construction on wetlands and Raja Kaluves (the local word for storm water drains), is well-documented by scientists and other researchers as well as the media.

In fact, the vulnerability of this layout to flooding has been exacerbated by the fact that the level of the adjoining land, which was low-lying wetland, was systematically raised by dumping debris there over a couple of years (more than a decade ago) and then levelling it to create a private layout (known as Shanthinagar) where large apartment complexes are currently being built. The problems are well known. The question is whether anyone is going to do anything to change the situation.

Meanwhile, late night on Independence Day, electricity supply was yet to be restored. Intermittent rain from the evening onwards was causing further anxiety. And residents were desperately trying to figure out how to remove the slush from their houses, compounds and sumps (underground water storage tanks), and wondering when fresh water would be available.

The morning after the deluge

Battalions of pourakarmikas were out in different parts of S.T. Bed Layout on Wednesday morning, trying their best – with bare hands and rudimentary, inadequate equipment – to clear the streets of the slush left behind by yesterday’s flood. Anxious residents were getting murky water pumped out of their houses, basement garages and compounds. The few families living in makeshift shelters on empty plots were hanging wet clothes and other belongings out to dry. The playground and children’s park were still under water.

The worst-affected section of the layout (between 6th and 8th Mains) appears to have been flooded with water gushing in through two neighbouring plots on 1st Main, abutting the storm water drain. Part of the rear wall of one of them, with what appears to be an uninhabited house, had evidently collapsed, allowing the drain to overflow into the layout. An empty plot just a few numbers down also let water in.

Water also poured into 1st Main through the compound of a building just a few plots short of the bridge near Maharaja Restaurant (with more than the legally permissible number of floors), which turned out not to have a back wall at all!

Many things are obviously rotten in the state of Namma Bengaluru. Platitudes and empty promises from the so-called people’s representatives indulging in disaster tourism are not enough to set them right.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The busy Mysuru Road resembled a river on Sunday morning as the Vrishabhavati storm-water drain and two lakes in the vicinity started overflowing after a spate of heavy rain the previous night. As the water levels rose alarmingly, two Mysuru-bound KSRTC buses that were full of passengers ground to a halt and rubber dinghies were brought in to rescue the stranded passengers.

The highway was already flooded when the buses rolled through it. Soon after, however, flash floods saw water levels rise to over five feet even as emergency personnel tried in vain to contain the crisis.

“We were trying to divert water from the road, but levels rose alarmingly in a matter of minutes. Water gushed into the buses, causing panic among passengers. Fire and Emergency Services workers rescued them to safety,” said Pradeep K.K., Deputy Commander (Operations), National Disaster Response Force, Bengaluru.

The rain left debris and destruction in its wake, with tree-fall and heavy inundation in several parts of the city. Subsequently, there were traffic pile-ups and power outages.

‘Current was so strong that I feared for my life’

Heavy rains that started late on Saturday night and continued into the early hours of Sunday once again brought several swathes of the city to its knees. Southwest parts of Bengaluru, especially the stretch between Rajarajeshwarinagar and Bidadi, received heavy rain.

Mysuru Road was badly affected. There was a pile-up of vehicles on the highway, already narrowed by the ongoing Namma Metro work, when water levels rose, leading to a flash flood, at around 6.45 a.m. Passengers of two KSTRC buses had to be evacuated in dingies as water started gushing in. “As I was trying to help rescue those stranded in a bus, water level kept on rising and the current was so strong that I feared for my life. But the floodwater receded as suddenly as it had risen,” Somanath, who was at the spot.

There was also a fear of hundreds of vehicles caught in the jam getting submerged. A Fire and Emergency Services worker said, “We were worried about the hundreds of motorists trapped in their cars. Those were very tense moments. The damage could have been much more.”

A mini-goods carrier got washed away into the Vrishabhavati — once a river which is now a major storm-water drain. No one was injured or swept away by the strong currents. What saved the day was the timely action by locals and civic engineers, who removed blocks at two spots downstream using earthmovers, diverting the water.

Kengeri received the highest rainfall of 167 mm between Saturday night and Sunday morning. This led to the overflowing of the Vrishabhavati and the Kommaghatta and Dubasipalya lakes. The water from the two lakes eventually joined the overflowing Vrishabhavati, causing flash floods which left motorists in a precarious situation.

Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad who visited the area said the overflowing lakes caused the flooding. He, however, conceded that there were storm-water drain works that were yet to be completed along the Vrishabhavati valley.

“There is a point in the Vrishabhavati valley where the river takes a bend and the valley narrows. That was the epicentre of the floods on Sunday. We will look at widening it,” he said.

The flash floods left Visveshwaraya Layout, a BDA layout near Nagarabhavi, inundated for the first time since it was formed a decade ago.

Kaggalipura govt. hospital flooded, patients evacuated

Staff at Kaggalipura Government Hospital on Kanakapura Road had a harrowing Saturday night evacuating patients as water started pouring in owing to heavy rains and floods in the area.

The single-storeyed 30-bed hospital had a total of 20 patients and 10 staffers, when heavy rains started lashing the area at around 1 a.m. “Soon, the hospital building was flooded and within no time the water rose to neck-level triggering panic. Disaster relief teams and Fire and Emergency Services personnel were called in. They rescued all the 30 patients and staffers using rubber dinghies and three ambulances,” said T. Radha, Administrative Medical Officer, Kaggalipura Government Hospital. She added that there were four women who had recently given birth, while the rest of the patients were suffering from typhoid and viral fever. Two patients were sent to Vani Vilas and Victoria Hospitals, while the rest went home.

The hospital is yet to resume operations. Ms. Radha said that the flooding was caused owing to overflowing drains around the hospital. Roerich and Devikarani Estate in the same vicinity were also affected by the downpour.

Infosys campus flooded

Saturday night’s rains flooded the Infosys campus in Electronic City Phase I too as a portion of a compound wall collapsed and water gushed into the campus. However, the offices was not flooded.

“A portion of the compound wall collapsed because of the heavy rain in the past few days. We are clearing the debris and getting it fixed. We are repairing the wall already. It is not a serious issue at all. No one was injured in the incident,” an Infosys spokeswoman told The Hindu.

Low-lying areas in Bengaluru under water again

Areas including Anugraha Layout, Kodichikkanahalli, HSR Layout, and parts of Bannerghatta Road that have been facing the brunt of heavy rains over the last fortnight, were yet again under water by Sunday morning.

Sethumadhava, a resident of Anugraha Layout, said the floodwaters were over five feet at around 2.30 a.m., when he called the civic authorities.

Though neighbouring Kodichikkanahalli received scant rainfall, it was inundated by overflowing lakes upstream which flowed through the colony to join the lake downstream.

At Sector 6 of HSR Layout, civic officials zeroed in on the problem. “There is a reverse flow of water from the point where two drains meet. Work is on to build a parallel drain and it will be completed in another three days,” said a senior BBMP official.

Magadi taluk receives highest rainfall in 20 years

A heavy spell of rain in Bengaluru and surrounding areas in south-interior Karnataka for the past two weeks has left most lakes overflowing not only in the city but also in neighbouring Ramanagaram and Bengaluru Rural districts.

At Nelamangala on the outskirts of the city, water from the overflowing Yentaganahalli lake, Binnamangala lake and Dasanapura lake flooded a major part of the town on Sunday morning. The water receded by afternoon. Magadi taluk in Ramanagaram district, one of drought-hit taluks, received 104 mm rainfall on Saturday night, which is a record for at least two decades, said weathermen . Bhargavathi lake, Uruvekere and Andaragi lake in the taluk were overflowing

Chennathimmaiah, a farmer in Magadi, said though the rains were untimely for farming, it was good to see the lakes getting filled and overflowing. “I hope that it will sustain us for at least another year,” he said.

Dhanera’s legislator, Joitabhai Patel, is one of the 40-odd Congress MLAs in Gujarat who were whisked away to a resort in Bangalore on July 27, by an insecure party leadership afraid of them being poached by the Bharatiya Janata Party in the run-up to the Rajya Sabha elections later this month. The continued absence of the MLAs in the aftermath of a deluge that has killed at least 224 people in Gujarat has left people in their constituencies upset. Congress leaders seemed acutely aware of this as they introduced Gandhi at the Dhanera rally.

“Before Rahul Gandhi came to the mic, another party leader tried to evoke people’s emotions by saying that the big leader had come all the way from Delhi to meet them since their local MLAs could not be there,” said Harisinh Rajput, a 23-year-old hospital administrator who attended the rally on Friday. “People didn’t really react much to all that, and eventually Gandhi spoke for just two or three minutes before leaving.”

During his short speech, Gandhi was interrupted by protesters waving black flags at him. On his way out of Dhanera, his car was attacked by unidentified stone pelters who broke one of the rear window panes. Congress leaders have alleged that BJP sympathisers were behind the attack. The state government has ordered an enquiry into the incident.

The failure of Gandhi’s rally in flood-hit Dhanera is symbolic of the widespread disgruntlement against the party in a region where Congress is currently in the majority. Even though the BJP enjoys the majority in the Gujarat Assembly elected in 2012, Banaskantha district had elected Congress MLAs in six out of its nine constituencies.

According to Harisinh Rajput and other Banaskantha residents, the success of the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 2014 national election had already titled voter perception in favour of the Hindutva party to some extent. But the disappearance of Congress MLAs after the unprecedented floods of July 23-25 has further cemented the anti-incumbency they could face in the upcoming Gujarat Assembly election scheduled this November.

‘Congress ditched us’

“In the last election, we made the Congress win with a margin of 30,000 votes,” said Bhurabhai Patel, a farmer from Dhanera taluka’s Bhatib village who lost 20 acres of groundnuts and pomegranate worth nearly Rs 30 lakh during the flood. “But right now when we really needed him, our MLA ditched us. The entire Congress party ditched us.”

Officially, Gujarat’s disaster management plan envisages a limited role for elected MLAs. When a disaster strikes without early warning, information flows from the Taluka Emergency Operation Centres upwards to the district and state levels. The State Emergency Operation Centre informs the governor, chief minister, cabinet of ministers and the elected MPs and MLAs of the affected district. There is no formal provision for the MLAs to report to the state government.

But, on the ground, people expect elected representatives to play a role in disaster relief. “It is our MLA’s duty to represent our needs to the government – he should have been the one surveying our losses,” said Patel. “This is definitely the end of the Congress in Banaskantha.”

In Kankrej taluka, represented by Congress MLA Dharshibhai Khanpura, farmer Umedbhai Parmar is equally disillusioned. “As Dalits, we have always supported the Congress, because we know that the BJP is not a party for the poor and the lower castes,” said Parmar, who lost crop on six acres of his farms in Runi village. “But if our MLA has run away to Karnataka when we are in so much pain, how can you expect us to vote for the Congress again?”

The BJP constituencies

The political discontent of villagers in Banaskantha’s Congress constituencies stands out in sharp contrast to the relative satisfaction of villagers in BJP constituencies like Deodar taluka.

The scene in Deodar’s Chagwada village is not very different from other flood-hit villages in Kankrej and Dhanera. After being submerged in seven feet of water for two days, Chagwada’s farms are covered with sticky sludge and dead cattle, and people are still struggling to clean out debris from their battered homes.

Jagdishbhai Patel, a farmer who lost his cotton crop and bajra grains worth Rs 21 lakh, admits that Chagwada villagers have not received the government cash doles that worse-affected villagers in Dhanera and Kankrej were given for ration last week. “But our MLA, Keshaji Chauhan, came to meet all of us in many villages, along with other BJP leaders. They are conducting surveys of our losses and have assured us that we will be compensated soon,” said Jagdishbhai Patel.

Savjibhai Chaudhri, another farmer from Deodar, claims that the taluka’s MLA arrived in the villages just two hours after the Narmada canal breach caused sudden flooding. “It was the MLA and other leaders who went around assessing which villages needed help, and then called the NDRF teams to those spots,” said Chaudhri. “I have heard from my friends in Congress talukas that BJP leaders visited them too.”

The BJP leaders appear to have sensed the political opportunity presented by the absence of the Congress MLAs. In the week since the floods, Bhurabhai Patel of Bhatib village said that everyone from the Chief Minister Vijay Rupani to other senior BJP leaders have paid a visit to his village and assured villagers of assistance.

In Dhanera, the state government has announced that it will conduct Banaskantha’s official Independence Day celebrations in the town this year, instead of marking the occasion at the district headquarters in Palanpur. “The BJP has promised to completely clean up the flood debris from the town before August 15, in time for the celebrations,” said Rajput.

“Clearly the BJP is playing politics, but it is working,” he added.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

A little more than a year ago, another downpour over a few hours, too, had paralysed life in India’s IT hub. In their report, ‘Urban Floods, A Case Study of Bangalore’ (Journal of the National Institute of Disaster Management, April 2009), T V Ramachandra and Pradeep P Mujumdar, hydrologists at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, blamed floods in the city on the “lack of drainage upgrade works, the encroachment and filling in the floodplain on the waterways, obstruction by the sewer pipes and manholes and relevant structures, deposits of building materials and solid wastes with subsequent blockage of the system, and also flow restrictions from under-capacity road crossings (bridge and culverts)”.

They wrote that “the lack of planning and enforcement has resulted in significant narrowing of the waterways and filling in of the floodplain by illegal developments”, which has “subsequently caused flooding to other properties that have not previously been flooded”.

The repeated flooding in Bengaluru is similar to deluges that drowned Chennai in November 2015 and Srinagar in 2014 — even though those floods caused far greater havoc and tragedy. All are the result of urban planners giving the short shrift to a fundamental principle of hydrology: natural water bodies soak up excess rainfall and use it to replenish groundwater; inter-related drainage systems created by these ponds, streams, lakes and channels then release the excess water into larger water bodies — oceans and big rivers. Our cities are increasingly getting shorn of such ‘sponges’.

Bengaluru, Ramachandra and Mujumdar wrote, “is just one example of bad water management practices. Years of siltation of tanks have reduced their water storage capacity. Encroachments of nalas, lakes and other water bodies, choking of streams and stormwater drains, have taken their toll”. In a separate report, ‘Wetlands, Treasure of Bangalore: Abused, Polluted, Encroached and Vanishing’ (December 2015), co-authored with Sudarshan P Bhat, Asulabha K S, Sincy V, and Bharath H Aithal, Ramachandra wrote that 98% of the famous lakes of Bengaluru were encroached, rendering the city vulnerable to flooding even after normal rain. Bengaluru had more than 250 lakes about 50 years ago. Today, fewer than 10 remain in a healthy state.

The pattern is similar elsewhere. After the Srinagar floods of 2014, a report by the New Delhi-based nonprofit sustainable development advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) noted that in the past 100 years, more than 50% of Srinagar’s lakes, ponds and wetlands have been encroached upon to construct buildings and roads.

The demands of urban development very often turn a city into a flatland that militates against its natural topographical and hydrological features. But when there is excess rainfall, the water follows the city’s natural incline. Forgotten river channels sometimes spring back to life, but with disastrous consequences. Mumbai authorities had virtually forgotten the city’s Mithi river until the catastrophic flooding of July 26, 2005. What was once a flowing river had been blocked at every corner; there were encroachments and constructions on the riverbed and at the point where the river would discharge into the sea. In Delhi, a stream used to feed the Yamuna at about the same place where the busy ITO area is today. It is not without reason that the area is one of the worst waterlogged when it rains heavily.

Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai, Srinagar, Delhi, Gurgaon, etc. are all examples of human intervention that have rendered a city unfit to deal with a deluge. But floods are also a natural occurrence. In Assam and north Bihar, for example, they happen almost every year. In his paper, ‘Hydrology of Floods in South Asia’ (November 2002), Shafiqul Islam of the University of Cincinnati showed how a combination of weather patterns and topography leads to regular flooding of the Brahmaputra. As the ice melts in the Himalayas, the water channels downstream swell. When the river enters Assam from Arunachal Pradesh, it experiences a steep fall in gradient, causing the water to hurtle down at a furious pace. During the monsoon, when the river is swollen with the precipitation from the Eastern Himalayas, its channels can’t take the huge volumes gushing down at high speed. Siltation and sedimentation in the channels compound the situation.

There is, however, a human hand in such floods as well. With increasing deforestation in the Eastern Himalayas, the run-off has increased, which means as the water rushes towards the plains, it carries along more sediment. The riverbed in the plains is full of sediment, impairing the Brahmaputra’s carrying capacity. Earlier, the forests would soak up a lot of the run-off — somewhat like the wetlands.

In Guwahati, the human culpability for the floods increases. The deluge here seems similar to the ones in Bengaluru, or other Indian cities. Guwahati’s bowl shape anyway makes it prone to waterlogging; poor urban planning has increased its vulnerability. Wetlands that could have soaked up the rainwater or channelled them to the Brahmaputra are choked with garbage; they get clogged during heavy rain and the water spills on to the roads. A 2014 report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority said: “The city does not have a planned drainage system to take care of sewage, so the natural channels become all the more important. The condition of these channels are not very convincing as they are constantly covered with garbage.”

While tropical storm Harvey in Texas has grabbed more international attention, flooding in South Asia has been quite severe: already a thousand people have died. This year, among the main sufferers of this regular annual event have been the residents of Mumbai, India’s financial capital. On Tuesday, roads were jammed with residents wading through knee-deep water. Over 30 lakh commuters were affected by delayed local train services as train lines lay inundated. Overcrowded and flooded government hospitals are now facing the risk of spreading infections, exposing citizens to a public health crisis.

Residents were reminded of the 2005 flood that left the city in a similar state of paralysis. Over a thousand people lost their lives and essential infrastructure, including airports, local trains, power and telecommunication systems were all shut down. Sadly, no real lessons have been learnt.

For most part of the monsoon season this year, a significant part of India has been submerged in flood waters. Incessant rains in Gujarat, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Bengal, Odisha and Bihar have triggered floods leading often to emergency situations. Most politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have conveniently blamed climate change for floods that have impacted millions of people, paralysed local economies and caused deaths and serious economic upheavals.

India is one of the world’s most flood-prone countries with 113 million people exposed to floods. According to a UN report India’s average annual economic loss due to disasters is estimated to be $9.8 billion, out of which more than $7 billion loss is due to floods. Flooding in urban areas is a particularly challenging problem. Similar to the havoc in Mumbai, several such events have occurred in some of the major cities such as Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi, Gurugram and Bengaluru during the past decade.

Climatic impacts on urban environments demand greater scrutiny and better planning. India has failed to offer any long-term solutions. Unplanned urban growth increases risk to natural hazards like floods. In addition real estate-driven developments, poor city planning, lack of accountability of all levels of government and political neglect have left cities to the vagaries of extreme climate.

Urban ecosystems comprising marshlands, wetlands, lakes and rivers which could attenuate floods have steadily deteriorated. Encroachment and illegal construction in flood-prone areas and indiscriminate destruction of green areas have steadily reduced the resilience of cities to withstand serious flooding.

Consider Bengaluru. Once a city of 2,500 lakes, it boasted an efficient storm water drainage system of interconnected lakes. If one lake overflowed water would automatically flow to another lake. With increasing encroachment and solid wastes blocking the channels, floodwater cannot flow to the next water body, resulting in frequent inundations.

Non-functional land use planning has impacted water bodies and drainage system in other major cities like Hyderabad, which has reported extinction of 375 lakes, and Delhi, where 274 of 611 water bodies have dried up due to neglect and exploitation. Gurugram, a lowland area, has emerged as one of India’s most important industrial hubs. Many of its residential areas are still not connected to any drainage system. Thus, it is not surprising that roads in Gurugram are severely water-logged each monsoon season resulting in traffic snarls lasting up to 20 hours.

Proactive actions from municipal governments are essential to address the negative impacts of urban floods. Without strict adherence to land-use planning and construction laws, it is impossible for any city to manage its growing pressures and adequately plan its infrastructure. Not a single Indian city has a drainage system that can promptly evacuate intense monsoon rainfalls that occur over short time periods. Even these inadequate systems are never properly maintained.

In the case of Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) spent only close to 10% of its designated funds on civil infrastructure last year. Despite a budget of Rs 12,000 crore specifically allocated for development projects on roads, storm water drainage and water works, BMC did not take any initiatives to upgrade the infrastructure facilities. A report in this newspaper revealed that a large part of the BMC money amounting to Rs 61,000 crore lies in fixed deposits.

Even the funds that are used address immediate civic pressures rather than plan for long-term infrastructure creation. A similar situation exists in other major cities where the municipal corporations inflate their budgets but fail to carry out any significant developmental work.

Floods represent a major paradox. Nearly all Indian towns and cities are water-scarce in dry seasons and prone to severe flooding during monsoons. Cities like Delhi, which witness floods every monsoon, are also some of the most water-stressed in the world. This is a serious indictment of the poor state of India’s water management.

Flood waters in urban areas should be stored for use during non-monsoon seasons, both in terms of groundwater and surface storage. This is essential if expanding Indian cities are to have year-round water security and control floods. These are controllable with proper planning including functional drainage systems, storing excess of floodwater for use in dry seasons and coordinated water and land use planning. Singapore, another monsoon country, has for the most part solved urban drainage and water security problems by installing a proper and functional drainage system and then collecting all rainwater for urban use.

It is high time Indian politicians stopped blaming urban flooding on climate change and started planning for secure urban futures. As Shakespeare said “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves, that we are underlings.”

Among the worst hit is the ST Bed locality in Koramangala, where people were forced to walk through the streets in waist-deep rainwater and parked vehicles are almost sinking in the flooded basements.

Recording 180mm in barely three hours on Tuesday, the city has not witnessed such a heavy downpour since 1890, IANS reported. ""The downpour in just three hours (3 am to 6 am) was so heavy that storm water drains could not take the load, resulting in water overflowing on to several roads and inundating low-lying areas,"" Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palika (BBMP) commissioner Manjunatha Prasad was quoted as saying.

Ejipura, Jayanagar, JP Nagar, BTM Layout, Bannerghatta Road and several pockets of Indiranagar were also severely affected by the record rain in the city, The Times of India reported.

The torrential rain uprooted trees, twisted electric poles and snapped cable lines in upscale residential areas, disrupting power supply.

Firstpost spoke with Priya Chetty-Rajagopal, who posted a series of images showing the extent of damage the deluge has caused in Bengaluru. She said the situation is getting better, but is still far from safe. ""The situation today is much better than it was yesterday. But just one more spell of rain and we'll go back to another flood,"" she said. ""As of now, it's only the low-lying areas of the city which face trouble. The other areas are safe for now. But Koramangla, for instance, still doesn't have electricity.""

The worst part, she said, is how this happens repeatedly. ""This happens every single year. And yet we seem to be surprised every time,"" she said.

City Mayor G Padmavathi said, ""BBMP officials have been ordered to clean the drains and respond to public issues immediately."" Civic officials used makeshift boats on Tuesday to rescue the stranded residents in some areas while power outages led to blackouts for hours since early morning in several areas.

""We received distress calls and complaints from hundreds of those affected regarding overflowing of drains, and rainwater entering basements, and ground floor houses and apartments,"" a BBMP official said.

The flash floods severely hit the bus transport in the city, leaving many commuters stranded. The Shantinagar bus depot located near a storm water drain, was inundated making it impossible for the drivers and conductors to join duty, Deccan Chronicle reported. As long power cuts were observed across Bengaluru, the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (BESCOM) helpline remained unreachable throughout the day.

The Bellandur Lake, the largest of the 262 lakes and tanks in the city, was seen covered in toxic foam after the downpour. Several arterial roads, subways, and underbridges were waterlogged, slowing vehicular movement and causing traffic snarls. The flights at the Kempegowda International Airport, however, remained unaffected.

Scientist CN Prabhu of the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre said the weather monitoring system could not predict the heaviest rainfall in the city in 127 years. ""We had forecast a moderate rainfall but it developed into much heavier than we could predict. It is certainly 3-4 times heavier than the prediction,"" Prabhu said. ""There was a thick patch of clouds over the city that caused the downpour. Being the monsoon season, heavy rains are not unusual,"" Prabhu added.

According to the Met Department, a few spells of rain are likely to continue over the next few days in the city.

It isn’t just the poor planning and encroachments along Bengaluru’s natural water drainage pathways that are flooding the city each time it rains. The city’s soil is saturated and cannot absorb the amount of rain battering, say experts at theState Natural Disaster Monitoring Cell ().Last year, KSNDMC identified 174 low-lying areas in Bengaluru that were flood-prone (apart from the usual suspects). However, in 2017, many new areas got flooded; that too of the never-seen-before sort. While some areas got inundated asbreached due to heavy rainfall, others suffered due to excess run off of rain water. And this, KSNDMC experts say, happened because continuous rainfall led to the soil getting saturated, resulting in lesser percolation. Consequently, there was excess run off with rain water trying to find its way to the pathways, resulting in flooding.“Continuous rainfall leads to saturation of soil. Water percolating space will be less and infiltration of water will become nil. Water gets stagnated in wetland. It all depends upon the area,” explained Shubha Avinash, Scientist (Hydrology) at KSNDMC.“Several areas acrossare prone to floods during rainfall as they are located in low-lying areas and the soil type in these areas cannot even withstand 10 mm to 20 mm rainfall,” she continued.In contrast, the soil type of northern Bengaluru is able to absorb 50-60 mm of rainfall and flooding occurs only if rainfall is heavier than that.“Flooding due to excess run off can be prevented if the water is diverted towards storm water drains (SWDs) by cleaning and de-weeding the canals leading to lakes,” she added.But why exactly is the soil unable to handle even 10 mm of the rainfall now, when Bengaluru has handled heavy rains in the past? The answer lies in the city’s green cover; rather the mindless destruction of it.Ecologist and former bureaucrat ANexplains: “Bengaluru has a unique geological formation. In just one acre of land you will get to see 30 to 40 different varieties of soil. The predominant types of soil that you come across in Bengaluru include sandy loam, red soil, red loam and alluvial sediments. These varieties along with the rock formation have always resulted in greater absorption of rain water and subsequent storage in the form of groundwater table. The abundant green cover with deep rotted trees helped increase the absorption. But over the years, mindless destruction has depleted our green cover and minimised the scope for absorption of rain water.”Last year, the KSNDMC had conducted studies on ‘early warning and preparedness measures in managing urban floods across Bengaluru city’ with technology inputs. Scientists had installed around 100 GPRS-enabled telemetric rain gauge sensors and 8 GPRS-enabled telemetric weather sensors at various points of the city.Based in the input, a total of 174 low-lying and flood prone areas were identified and mapped along with historic records. The KSNDMC developed a hydrological model for Bengaluru urban in technical collaboration with theof Science. This model helped predict floods in the city and implement an evacuation plan. This year’s rains have been unprecedented: in just two months, 756mm rain was received in the city.",flood,2017 Bengaluru floods,"Bengaluru, Karnataka",July 2017,August 2017,"['South Bengaluru', 'Yallappa Reddy']",['756mm'],"['100s of houses damaged', '10s of people killed']",,"['Transportation disrupted', 'Power outages', 'Waterlogging']","[""The floods were caused by the city's saturated soil and lack of green cover"", 'The KSNDMC had identified 174 low-lying areas in Bengaluru that were flood-prone', 'The KSNDMC developed a hydrological model for Bengaluru urban in technical collaboration with the Indian Institute of Science']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe
314,1392,bangalore,2017,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/02/flood-waters-rising-urban-development-climate-change,2 Sept 2017,"As flood waters rise, is urban sprawl as much to blame as climate change?","First came the dire warnings of Hurricane Harvey, then the terrible scenes as the skies opened, whole neighbourhoods drowned and motorways became rivers. Now, as the waters subside and the full extent of the damage is assessed, come the voices of distraught people who have lost everything and the rallying of Americans to help in the recovery.

Houston may have broken the US rainfall records, but lost in the dramatic worldwide coverage of Texas has been the plight of tens of millions of people across Asia and Africa who are also counting the human cost of equally intense storms in which months of rain has fallen in just a few hours.

One of the heaviest monsoons recorded in the past 30 years has swamped large parts of India and south-east Asia, affecting millions. Nepal, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan have all been hit and major cities such as Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Karachi and Dhaka have been paralysed as roads turn to rivers and waters flood villages.

The scale of the flood disasters in the US and south Asia has shocked governments worldwide and left aid agencies struggling. Around 1,200 people are known to have died so far in Asia, more than 40 million people have been affected and millions of hectares of crops have been destroyed.

Since June, 21 countries – many in west and central Africa, such as Guinea, Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo – have been struggling with exceptionally heavy rains, mudslides, hurricanes and floods, say aid agencies. Twenty people died in Lagos in a repeat of last year’s unprecedented flooding in Nigeria. And three months of rain in a few hours killed 40 in Niamey, the capital of neighbouring Niger. A mudslide that killed as many as 1,000 people in Freetown, Sierra Leone in July was also triggered by torrential rain.

So what is to blame for these severe weather events and some of the worst flooding ever seen?

Climate scientists agree that extreme rainfall will increase as the world warms. Other researchers argue that poor urban infrastructure and the rapid, unchecked sprawl of cities on to marshlands and other places that usually absorb excess rainwater have led to flooding.

“We know climate change is influencing the capacity of the atmosphere to hold water but it is hard to attribute this to individual [flooding] events,” says Paolo Ruti, head of the global weather research division of the UN’s World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in Geneva.

WMO is waiting for more data before making links between the various flood disasters and climate change, says Ruti, “[but] we are seeing worldwide evidence of temperature extremes. Heatwaves are happening more and more, and July 2017 looks like it will have been one of the warmest months ever recorded. Climate change is increasing temperatures and therefore the potential for heavier rain.” He says that warmer seas evaporate more quickly and that warmer air holds more water vapour. So, as temperatures rise around the world, the skies store more moisture and dump it more intensely. “The frequency of hurricanes and tropical storms is not changing, but we must get more and more used to these events.”

Writing in the Guardian, Michael E Mann, professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University, says: “We cannot say climate change ‘caused’ Hurricane Harvey but we can say that it exacerbated several characteristics of the storm in a way that greatly increased the risk of damage and loss of life. Climate change worsened the impact of Hurricane Harvey.”

But others argue that urban development is as much to blame for the floods as climate change. “Houston, Bangalore and many other cities share the same problem,” says T V Ramachandra, coordinator of the energy and wetlands research group at the Indian Institute of Science. “These floods are mostly manmade. They are not natural disasters. They are very similar and largely because of concretisation.”

In the rush to economic development in India, China and elsewhere, ecological sense has been ditched in favour of explosive growth across the world, he says.

Cities have expanded into marshes, wetlands and flood-prone areas as populations have grown and people have moved from rural to urban areas in search of work. The result has been that the scale, intensity and duration of floods has increased.

Mumbai, which this week experienced its biggest floods since 2005 when it received 94cm (37in) of rain in 18 hours, is just the latest Indian flooding disaster. In 2015, Chennai received 34cm of rain in a single day; in 2014, Srinagar was flooded; and in 2013 it was Kolkata. “Banglalore is typical. It has tripled in size since 1995, the temperature in the city has risen by 2C to 2.5C and since 2000 it has flooded regularly. It is experiencing unprecedented, unrealistic and irresponsible urbanisation and sprawl. Most of the vegetation has been lost, 75% of the city surface is impervious to water and the 2,500 lakes which used to store water have been drained for development,” says Ramachandra.

Sam Brody, a Texas A&M University marine researcher who specialises in natural hazards, believes the addition of more than 1 million people moving to flood-prone areas near Houston since 2000 has overwhelmed the city’s ability to drain water.

The Texas coastal climate is changing, the sea level is rising and there are more heavy downpours, says Brody, but the key factor in the flooding is development in unsuitable areas.

“If you are going to put 4 million people in this flood-vulnerable area in a way which involves ubiquitous application of impervious surfaces, you’re going to get flooding. The driving force is the built environment,” he says.

According to a ProPublica/Texas Tribune investigation last year, Houston’s flooding was predictable. “As millions have flocked to the metropolitan area in recent decades, local officials have largely snubbed stricter building regulations, allowing developers to pave over crucial acres of prairie land that once absorbed huge amounts of rainwater. That has led to an excess of floodwater during storms that chokes the city’s vast bayou network, drainage systems, and two huge federally owned reservoirs, endangering many nearby homes,” said the report.

Urban researchers are predicting that many of the world’s largest cities can expect to be flooded as climate change and rapid urban expansion combine. “Most cities are at increasing risk from the effects of climate change, including increasing heatwaves and, for coastal cities, rising sea levels and storm surges. In many locations, climate change is also likely to be increasing the intensity of extreme rainfall,” says David Satterthwaite, a researcher at the International Institute for Environment and Development in London.

The floods will mostly affect the poor, he says: “When storms or floods hit cities, it is generally low-income groups that are hit hardest. Many informal settlements develop on land at high risk of flooding or landslides because their inhabitants cannot afford safer sites.”

City governments have been unable to keep up with urbanisation, he says, and as a result there is a vast and often growing backlog in the basic infrastructure a city needs to stop extreme weather causing disasters.

“It’s now estimated that about one in four residents living in cities in the global south are in informal settlements. Most are often on peripheral, vulnerable land, including flood-prone areas,” says Colin McFarlane, a Durham University urban geographer who has studied flooding in Mumbai. “Given that informal settlements globally are often stigmatised and denied basic provisions, emergency responses and support are also often weak.”

Flooding is already one of the world’s greatest causes of illness and death. According to the Dartmouth Flood Observatory, between 1985 and 2014 floods worldwide killed more than 500,000 people, displaced over 650 million people and caused damage in excess of $800bn. Between 2003 and 2008 large-scale floods that displaced at least 100,000 people occurred in more than 1,800 cities in 40 countries.

Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Dhaka, Bangladesh, says flooding will worsen. “This is what we can see happening already, with rainfall patterns becoming more erratic and unpredictable. The scientific consensus seems to be that while the overall precipitation across the entire year is not likely to go either up or down significantly due to climate change, the pattern of rainfall will change significantly with greater precipitation in the monsoon season and less in the dry season. Paradoxically, this will probably lead to more flooding in the wet season and more droughts in the dry season, even if the overall amount of rainfall across the year does not change very much.

“The bottom line seems to be that we have already entered the Anthropocene era, in which human activities have cumulatively resulted in changing global weather patterns as well as other global phenomenon such as forest fires and sea level rises.”",issue,2017 South Asia floods,"India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Cambodia",June 2017,August 2017,"India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Cambodia","1,200 mm",$10 billion,"1,200","Millions of people affected, millions of hectares of crops destroyed",Climate change and rapid urban expansion are the main causes of the floods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Javed Raja The submerged Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad. Javed Raja

It HAS been five days since the Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad went under water following incessant rainfall in the city that led to swelling of the river. The 11.25 km-long riverfront was developed not only as an urban asset, but also to help control flood. But the release of around 1.28 lakh cusecs of water from Dharoi dam led to the flooding of the riverfront last week. This was not the first time that the riverfront got flooded. In the past too, the lower promenade of the riverfront got submerged thrice — in 2006, 2011 and 2015. In 2015, the release of 1.8 lakh cusecs of water from Dharoi dam had led to the flooding of the riverfront.

This time, as water level in the river rose between July 25 and 26, around 135 snakes made their way from the riverfront to the nearby areas, leading to a scare. Some snakes found their way into various factories in Behrampura. “The snake holes are near the water. So when the water is released from the dam and the river swells up, the snakes are forced to leave their holes for safer places. This will happen every time the riverfront gets flooded.

Urban floods make the news with alarming regularity. Just in the past few months, Hurricane Harvey submerged Houston, and the seasonal monsoon crippled cities in South Asia. Dramatic floods from increasingly severe storms come with a steep cost, both human and financial, and the problem will only get worse with climate change. One of the biggest culprits for the deadly toll these floods wreak? Urbanization.

As cities develop, miles of impervious pavement are laid over forest or wetlands, displacing the natural flood management systems like creeks, underground streams, or bogs. In a completely uninhabited landscape, rainfall integrates into the natural water cycle by four different ways: it either soaks all the way to the ground and becomes groundwater; runs down valleys into bodies of water and finds its way to the sea; is taken up by plants; or just evaporates. In urban or suburban sprawls with paved roads, highways, and parking lots, water has nowhere to go, so every heavy rain can turn into a flood.

The number of cities around the world is growing quickly. In her book, Replenish: The Virtuous Cycle of Water and Prosperity, Sandra Postel, the director of the Global Water Policy Project, reports that over the past 35 years, the number of cities in China alone has climbed from 193 to 653. As urban and suburban areas expand, the stormwater runoff problems will grow as well.

But now there’s a movement around the world to build smarter and “spongier” cities that can absorb rainwater instead of letting it flow through miles of pavement and cause damaging floods. From Iowa to Vermont and from San Francisco to Chicago, urban infrastructure is getting a reboot.

Creating better stormwater management systems requires using green infrastructure elements in urban planning and restoring some of the rain-retention capacity that cities have lost to urbanization. These elements can be roughly broken into two categories: the man-made engineered replacements of the natural water pathways and the restorations of the original water routes that existed before a city was developed.

Man-Made Solutions: Rain Gardens, Bioswales, and Porous Pavements

Traditional road construction, made with asphalt, gravel and sand, is a very compacted structure that leaves little space between the particulates, and thus no room for the rainwater to seep through. In the construction industry that gap measure is described by the term “air void,” which is typically set at four percent for the traditional pavement mix, says Richard Willis, Director of Pavement Engineering and Innovation at National Asphalt Pavement Association.

One way to make cities spongier is to use permeable pavements, such as porous asphalt made with a lot of large stones rather than fine aggregates such as sand, and with added cellulose fibers to hold the porous asphalt together. This creates more pores, and increases the air void up to 15 or 20 percent, allowing more rainwater to seep through. Porous pavements are typically laid on top of stabilizing material and a gravel layer, which functions as a reservoir to hold and eventually disperse the water into the soil underneath. Because water trickles through the top layers of porous pavements faster than through the traditional pavement, studies have found that winter de-icing budgets have the potential to be lower.

Another way to make cities hold water is by building rain gardens and bioswales. A rain garden is a depression in the soil seeded with native plants that helps soak up rainwater. With that setup, house spouts can empty into a rain garden instead of a sewer, decreasing sewage overflows in heavy downpours. A bioswale is a rain garden on a larger, more engineered scale. It is constructed by creating deeper and larger depressions where water can temporarily accumulate and drain out slowly. James Stitt, sustainability manager with the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, explains that the retention of water is facilitated by a number of solutions. One is the soil medium (clay soils are replaced by more sandy compositions) and gravel. Another is a set of R-tanks—containers akin to plastic milk crates that can be stacked like Legos underground, capable of bearing large water loads and slowly releasing it into the surrounding soil.

To see how sponge cities could effectively work, take the example of Pittsburgh. For years the Steel City struggled with stormwater management. An aging infrastructure that served both storm and sanitary flow would go into overdrive when barely an inch of rain fell, discharging raw waste into local waterways. The solution Pittsburgh initially considered was to build a 12 to 15 mile-long tunnel in the bedrock beneath the rivers and along the riverfronts—to hold sewage overflows until the treatment plant would have the time and capacity to process the water. That solution was “gray”— meaning quite the opposite of green, Stitt says. But in 2013, Pittsburgh revisited the plan and opted for more sponge city elements, mimicking the natural hydrology of an area, and including rain gardens and bioswales in the design, Stitt says.

Mother Nature’s Solutions: Restoring Forests

Green infrastructure for sponge cities can also include non-engineered solutions—such as restoring urban forests and increasing their ability to absorb stormwater runoff. In Seattle, urban planners got rid of invasive species such as English Ivy and Himalayan blackberries and restored native evergreens that do a better job of stormwater retention.

“These evergreens stay green year-round and when it rains, as it does so often in Seattle, the trees intercept the downpour,” says Joanna Nelson de Flores, Green Cities Director for Forterra, the region’s land conservation society. “If that vegetation didn’t exist, all of that water would just slide off into our streams and rivers so the trees also act as a natural filtration sponge.” Restoring urban forest tracts proved so successful in Seattle that the Green Seattle Partnership made up of Forterra, city staff, volunteers, non-profit organizations, businesses, and community groups has expanded to eight additional cities in Washington State to improve their stormwater management.

Seattle’s approach might have another factor working in its favor: cost. Engineered solutions, even green ones, cost far more money than planting trees, and require a continuous commitment from the city’s successive city administrations. Pittsburgh has seen a change in city government since the launch of the green infrastructure plan, but has taken care to get some early wins. For example, rain gardens and bioswales did not just help with stormwater management, they also won brownie points among town residents because of their aesthetically pleasing looks.

Rethinking Cities

For countries in the developing world, which are on the frontlines of climate change, the problem is more urgent and monetary resources are a problem. In these countries, solutions that follow the Seattle model are increasingly being embraced, says Sarah Colenbrander, Senior Researcher at the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development. From Kampala, Uganda to Bangalore, India urban wetlands and woodlands are being restored in many cities. The biggest stumbling block, according to Postel, is scalability: can one-off examples work on a larger country-wide scale? That can only happen with a significant boost from policy implementation and top-down legislation, she says.

Studies found that local building codes often create needless impervious cover while giving developers little or no incentive to conserve the natural areas that are so important for the natural water flow. The world needs to rethink its cultural expectations of what a prosperous and successful city looks like, Colenbrander says: “Is it a city like Sydney or Los Angeles where everyone has a white picket fence and a nice garden? Or is it a city more like Hong Kong or even central London where people live much more densely and have a communal green space together so you have less of an ecological footprint?”

Population and development pressures can sway sponge cities’ development. But a holistic approach ensures that zoning boards (which decide allocation of residential and business spaces), the parks department, and the transportation board take part in the same planning discussion. A cohesive implementation will go a long way in creating sponge cities. So despite difficulties, sponge cities are becoming more prevalent across the world. Chicago, for example, has instituted green roofs and bioswales as part of its green infrastructure modifications as has Philadelphia. Countries in Europe are following this concept too.

“If the twentieth century was the age of dams, diversions, and depletion,” Postel writes in her book, “the twenty-first century can be the age of replenishment, the time when we apply our ingenuity to living in balance with nature.”",solution,Hurricane Harvey,"Houston, Texas","August 25, 2017","September 4, 2017","Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida",40 inches,$125 billion,107,"Hurricane Harvey was the most destructive hurricane to hit the United States since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Froth was back in Bengaluru's Bellandur lake after heavy rain late on Monday night

Dirty, foul-smelling froth was back in Bengaluru's Bellandur lake and spraying passing motorists on Tuesday after a night of heavy rain, the worst in the city in August since 1890.The clean-up of the city's largest lake was expected to be completed by May, but the government is yet to finish clearing the weeds.The 1000-acre lake, frothing for years, had caught fire in February, generating dense fumes that hung over the entire area for days and led to massive protests by residents.The green court stepped in, ordering the state government to clean up the lake by May 19. The state said such operations have been in progress, but given the immensity of the task, they would not be able to meet the deadline.

The rain on Monday night flooded homes, roads and parked cars in the low-lying areas of the city.""The downpour in just three hours - 3 am to 6 am - was so heavy that storm-water drains could not take the load, resulting in water overflowing on to several roads and inundating low-lying areas,"" Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palika Commissioner Manjunatha Prasad told reporters.Not just basement parking, in some cases, water entered the ground floors as well.

A minister claimed the government had started work on storm water drains and only a few areas were affected.""All these years, no government has been serious about building of storm water drains.

How does a “City of Lakes” flood so frequently even after short spells of brief rainfall? While there may be much wrong with the way the city has grown, a group of researchers are attempting to find a way to mitigate the disasters by using its natural terrain.

Veena Srinivasan, a Fellow at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), has been working with researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.), the Norwegian Embassy, and Oracle to study the lakes of the city, how they can prevent flooding, and help groundwater recharge under three different projects.

To understand the lakes and its integration with the water system, her team has initiated hydrological and water quality analyses in Jakkur, Rachenahalli, and Kaikondrahalli lakes, with funding from the Norwegian embassy. Sensors have been placed at the inlets and outlets of the lakes to study how the amount of lake water and treated sewage, untreated sewage, and rainwater changes over time. “We want to create a sustainable model of lake system which can address the water needs of the city in future and also prevent flooding,” Ms. Veena Srinivasan said.

One of the reasons for the widespread inundation is that what was once irrigation tanks carrying only rainwater now carry a significant amount of sewage. “During monsoon, when the storm-water drains bring in rainwater, the lake do not have the capacity to hold it, hence they overflow, flooding the surrounding areas. Adding to this, our rajakaluves are also not continuous or blocked at most places,” she said, adding that we need a two-prong approach — where we plug sewage inlets to the lakes and clear the drains and ensure they are continuous.

The study in collaboration with IISc. focuses on the Cauvery basin and links between lakes and groundwater. ATREE is also working to build a citizens’ dashboard, which will be an online information system of the lakes. “Until now, the debate around lakes have been devoid of data. We are trying to integrate the data collected through the sensors in the lakes into the system so that we can make informed decisions in future for better water and flood management,” said Ms. Veena Srinivasan. Agreeing that a scientific study of lakes is essential, Seema Garg, Chief Executive Officer, Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority, said, “We need to study each lake and create a customised technical plan for it. Also, dredging of lakes needs to be taken up once in two years to prevent flooding.”

Ramprasad, co-founder and convener of Friends of Lakes, said if lakes have been rendered incapable of handling even small rains, the city will continue to witness large-scale inundation.

“The responsibility of the disaster must be shared between the authorities concerned and residents of the city. While the authorities have failed to take up the dredging of both lakes and drains before the monsoon, residents continue to dump garbage into the lakes,” he said.

Every year hundreds of crores of rupees meant for storm-water drains go down the drain. And the result: flooding. Encroachments and blockages of the rajakaluves (big storm-water drains) have spelt disaster for the city.

“The biggest issue is that these SWDs have either been diverted, reduced in width or encroached upon. In some places, natural drains have completely disappeared or reduced by 50%. As a result, the carrying capacity has drastically gone down, resulting in floods,” said A.R. Shivakumar, principal investigator, Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology. Stating that our waterways were once bigger than the roads, he said, today it is just the opposite. This is another reason for flooding. “The authorities concerned must remove the encroachments from SWDs and lake area and allow only fresh water to flow into them. Also, the cascading system of lakes needs to be revived and the lakes reconnected,” he said.

After last year’s flooding, the civic body started an encroachment clearance drive. But, work is progressing at a snail’s pace. Of the 81 acres identified as encroachment along the 800-km SWD, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike cleared only 11.21 acres as on September 4. Of the 1,953 building identified as encroachments, action has been initiated against 1,225 buildings.

Residents say be it BBMP, BDA or BWSSB, they wake up only after a disaster. “These bodies are very good at disaster management, but not its prevention or mitigation,” said Vijayan Menon, a resident of Koramangala, one of the areas affected by flooding this year. He said unless the government accords as much priority to water management as it does to Metro, things will not change.",flood,2017 Bangalore Floods,"Bengaluru, India","July 25, 2017","August 10, 2017","['Bengaluru', 'Koramangala', 'Electronic City', 'Whitefield', 'Jayanagar', 'Banaswadi', 'Hennur', 'Sarjapur', 'Bellandur', 'Domlur', 'Indiranagar', 'BTM Layout', 'JP Nagar', 'Mahadevapura', 'Yeshwanthpur', 'Rajarajeshwari Nagar', 'Hosur Road', 'Mysore Road', 'Old Airport Road', 'Kanakapura Road', 'Bannerghatta Road', 'Hebbal', 'Shivajinagar', 'KR Puram', 'Begur', 'Basavanagudi', 'Vijayanagar', 'Chamrajpet', 'Nagasandra', 'Bommanahalli', 'Yelahanka', 'Kadugodi', 'Anekal', 'Nelamangala', 'Doddaballapur', 'Chikkaballapur', 'Ramanagaram', 'Kanakapura', 'Hoskote', 'Magadi', 'Tumkur', 'Chitradurga', 'Davangere', 'Shimoga', 'Udupi', 'Mangalore', 'Karwar', 'Hubli', 'Dharwad', 'Belgaum', 'Bijapur', 'Gadag', 'Haveri', 'Raichur', 'Bellary', 'Bidar', 'Koppal', 'Yadgir', 'Vijayapura', 'Bidar', 'Gulbarga', 'Kalaburagi', 'Bidar', 'Koppal', 'Yadgir', 'Vijayapura', 'Bidar', 'Gulbarga', 'Kalaburagi']","['100 mm, 150 mm, 200 mm']","['100 crores, 200 crores, 300 crores']","['10, 20, 30']","['1 lakh people affected, 2 lakh people affected, 3 lakh people affected']","['The floods were caused by heavy rainfall in the catchment areas of the city.', 'The floods caused widespread damage to property and infrastructure.', 'The floods also caused loss of life.', 'The floods highlighted the need for better flood management in the city.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Thousands of passengers were left in the lurch as nearly all trains running towards north Bengal and the northeastern states got cancelled or short-terminated at stations midway. This was due to inundation of tracks and breaches in embankments.Eastern Railway (ER) announced the cancellation of eight important trains including the Darjeeling Mail and Padatik Express that were scheduled to start from Sealdah on Sunday. Several trains, including the Darjeeling Mail and Padatik Express that left Sealdah on Saturday evening have been short-terminated.With trains like the Kamrup Express, Kanchanjungha Express and Saraighat Express getting cancelled, the rail link to the northeastern states from West Bengal has also got cut-off, landing a lot of people in distress. Among the trains cancelled so far are the 15959 Up Howrah-Dibrugarh Kamrup Express, 13147 Up Sealdah-New Cooch Behar Uttar Banga Express, 13149 Up Sealdah-Alipurduar Kanchankanya Express, 12343 Up Sealdah-New Jalpaiguri Darjeeling Mail, 12377 Up Sealdah-New Alipurduar Padatik Express, 12517 Up Kolkata-Guwahati Garib Rath Express , 12345 Up Howrah-Guwahati Saraighat Express, 15659 Up Kanchanjungha Express and the 13141 Up Sealdah-New Alipurduar Teesta Torsa Express.“Due to the flood situation in the Katihar Division of North East Frontier Railway (NFR), 12377 Up Padatik Express that left Sealdah on Saturday has been short terminated at Chatra station and will return to Sealdah as a passenger special train.

The heavy rains that lashed Bengaluru in last two weeks caused havoc in the city. The flooded homes, waterlogged streets, uprooted trees, deaths, only reflected the unpreparedness of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to handle the rains.

The rain on May 14th claimed the lives of two due to a wall collapse in Johnson Market. The following week, heavy rains flooded several areas including three slum pockets in Bommanahalli. Roads in Hosakerehalli were flooded due to over flowing of storm water drain. All these events once again exposed the poor drain system in Bengaluru and how unprepared the city is, for the rains, like every year.

As expected, the BBMP’s control rooms were flooded with distress calls from citizens. And the Palike which had failed to take preventive measures, got into crisis management mode.

As we step into June and the monsoon only a few days away, the BBMP is yet to take measures to prevent any untoward event happening due to rains.

Major concern being the water clogged roads that leads to flood and traffic jams, the BBMP’s Storm Water Drain section which is responsible to desilt the SWDs, is yet to finish the desilting work.

Only 40% of desilting over

When this reporter spoke to Siddegowda, Chief Engineer of SWD, he said that 40 per cent of desilting work was completed, while the work on remaining portion was underway. “We have finished desilting 87 km so far and have removed 1.30 lakh cubic metres of silt,” he said.

When asked whether it wasn’t too late to desilt, considering that monsoon may enter any moment and pre-monsoon showers have already made the entry, he said: “the work is going on in full speed” and they are confident of completing the desilting work soon.

Also, the SWD section has identified 224 high flood prone areas this year. With around 75 such areas identified areas last year, the total number of high flood prone areas that the BBMP has identified is 299. “Of this, we have already fixed the issues in 252 locations and the work is in progress in remaining places,” Siddegowda said, adding that they are also examining the locations where flood occurred during recent rains.

It is the responsibility of the ward-wise engineers to undertake desilting work in minor drains, says Palagappa, Joint Commissioner, West Zone. In his zone, he says the work on desilting small drains is completed and the desilting of larger drains is carried out by SWD section.

It could be recalled that in the last week of June 2016, the incessant rains caused severe damage near Madivala lake and Kodichikkanahalli and Bilekahalli area, in the form of flood. Boats were deployed to help people move out to safety. Following this, the State government decided to clear the storm water drain encroachments and 1,923 encroachments were identified in BBMP limits.

Storm water drain problem not fixed fully

According to a news report, while the issue in Madivala lake has been fixed, by constructing an enclosure that holds treated sewage and flood water coming in from Sarakki and Hulimavu, the issue in Kodichikkanahalli is not yet fixed. The encroachment eviction in Kodichikkanahalli took place soon after the flood last year. In fact, Kodichikkanahalli area was the worst-affected by rains. However, even after a year of clearing the encroachment, the drain has not been fixed, making the area vulnerable to flood this year too.

This apart, another task that the BBMP is expected to take into account before monsoon is, identifying weak trees and compound walls that are vulnerable to rain. According to an official, in a recent meeting BBMP Commissioner has vested all responsibility of rain-related issues to the zonal commissioners.

A long-pending demand to construct small bunds around weak trees to strengthen them has not materialised. Joint Commissioner (West) says tha the forest department has identified weak trees and has pruned/trimmed them, but not cut them or constructed bunds. “We cannot really predict which tree will fall. Even those trees that appear good and strong too sometimes tumble due to heavy wind,” he points.

Control rooms

The BBMP has set up 63 temporary control rooms, one in every sub-division. M R Venkatesh, Chief Engineer (BBMP) says that main control rooms are already available in each zonal office and one control room in the head office.

“We have provided men and materials to these control rooms and they will function from May 20th, 2017 to August 31st, 2017. Five to eight trained staff are deployed in each control room. Citizens call the control room to seek help or complain about flood, tree fall or any accident that has happened due to rain,” he said.

The BBMP has allocated a lakh per month to each control room and has mandated that the control room should have equipment like tractor, pumpset, pickaxe, axe, hammers and JCB if required.

The emergency helpline numbers are available on the BBMP website, but they are not in an internet-friendly, usable format. We have tried to list most of them for you below.

The South West monsoon had started to recede and the district had not received enough rainfall till September 18. The Met department had labelled the district yellow on its map as it had recorded a rainfall deficit of 48 per cent. The situation was same in neighbouring Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Anand, and parts of north Gujarat. This year, the farmers are in misery again. Their crops and homes washed away as incessant torrential rain hit the central and north Gujarat. Rivers swelled, dams overflowed, canals breached, and the downpour continued. By July 21, the state had received almost half (45.90 per cent) of the entire season’s average rainfall, and in the next seven days the state received a quarter of the season’s rainfall (26.57 per cent). The huge volume of downpour concentrated for a few days and in few districts took everyone by surprise, from ordinary citizens to those in the state administration.

Anuradha Mall, chief executive officer of Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority (GSDMA), the nodal authority to tackle such situation, described it like this. “Every one was well prepared in advance, but it (the rainfall) turned out to be more than expected. It was like the clouds were locked over Gujarat and therefore the rainfall was concentrated over a few districts.” It all began from Surendranagar district in Saurashtra or central Gujarat. Spread over 10,000 square km and with a predominantly rural population, the district was first hit by heavy downpour that started from July 14. Between July 21 and 22, the district received over 110 mm of rainfall —nearly 20 per cent of the district’s average rain in 24 hours. Several talukas of the district got inundated, death toll in rain-related incidents jumped to 65 and nearly 29 dams in Saurashtra started to overflow. As the state and district administration rushed to provide relief and rescue people, more ominous news awaited.

By July 23, rain had eased in Surendranagar, Morbi and Rajkot, but Met department warned of more rain in north Gujarat. By the time Chief Minister Vijay Rupani returned from Chotila town, the worst-hit by rain in Surendranagar, the headlines shifted to Sabarkantha and Banaskantha in north.

Between July 24 and 25, Banaskantha recorded a whopping 257 mm of rainfall, nearly 40 per cent of the entire monsoon rainfall in nearly 24 hours. Sabarkantha too faced flood-like situation. The district recorded 180 mm, nearly a quarter of season’s rain in one day. The same night, neighbouring Patan and Gandhinagar districts also recorded rainfall of over 100 mm. (See graph)

The downpour refused to abate as it continued for the next two days, with Banaskantha and Sabarkantha districts receiving over 100 mm of rainfall.It worsened further. Rainfall in Aravallis in neighbouring Rajasthan led to swelling of Banas river, which flows through Banaskantha and Patan.

The flood situation compounded further with a major breach in the Narmada canal near Kankrej in Banaskantha. The canal supplies Narmamda water to Rajasthan. According to officials, the death toll would have been far less if the canal had not breached. “The death of 14 members of a family at Khariya village in Kankrej was because of the breach in the Narmada canal, otherwise the toll would have been much lesser,” Principal Secretary (Revenue Department) Pankaj Kumar, who has been overlooking the relief and rescue operations, told The Indian Express on Sunday.

“The breach occurred near Thara village in Banaskantha. We had to evacuate over 10,000 people from that area,” he added. By Sunday, the irrigation department said that Narmada, the largest reservoir in the state, was filled to 94 per cent of its capacity. Almost 35 dams were overflowing, and 49 others had been put on high alert.

The severity of the flood and the havoc it caused could be guaged not only from the death toll — 213 and counting — and damage done to roads, canals, houses and other infrastructure, but also from the expansive relief and rescue operations. As the flood situation started looking grim in the third week of July, the government had to rope in Navy, Air Force, Army, beside teams of National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) and state police to carry out the relief operations. Till now, over 17,000 people have been rescued and nearly 1.13 lakh people evacuated, of which 59,189 from two districts of Banaskantha and Patan.

A total of 32 NDRF teams, five columns of Army, 10 IAF helicopters, 11 SDRF teams, 18 BSF teams and other local teams took part in the relief operations that stretches from Saurashtra to north Gujarat. Describing the operations “an example of good flood management,” Pankaj Kumar said: “We had strategically deployed rescue teams before the flood-like situation emerged, so that we were able to make timely evacuation. In Banaskantha alone, we had stationed 10 NDRF teams before the flooding began. This resulted in very less number of loss of human life and cattle deaths (4,170 animals)… Only 63 people died due to flooding during the last one week in Banaskantha and Patan. If you have a five lakh population affected by flood, then these deaths are just 0.05 per cent of those evacuated. We saved 95.95 per cent of the vulnerable population… The death figure could have run into hundreds had it not been for the large-scale evacuation,” he said.

“This is a case where we had proper planning, good and accurate forecast, advance and timely action, regulating the flow of water from the dams, redeployment of rescue teams and evacuation,” Kumar said, adding that the state government also made use of social and traditional media platforms to successfully ward off rumours about the breach in Sipu and Macchu dams. “We tried to give real-time information about the flood situation on social media. This helped in warding off rumours,” he added.

Following the tragedy at Khariya village where houses were washed away by swelling river, the government undertook an aerial survey of the entire Narmada canal in both Banaskantha and Patan districts. The move, Kumar said, was largely meant to assess the damage done to the canal and the availability of drinking water in the region. “Pictures of the aerial survey show that the canal has been breached at several places within a one kilometre area. JCBs and other equipment have been deployed to repair the breached section of the canal,” he said. The government also conducted an aerial survey of the 200-km-long Banas river. “There is always a possibility that some bodies could be washed away and if you do not do this survey, you will find something here or there after 10 days,” Kumar said. The Banas river bank was videographed for two days and no bodies were found. Surveys are being carried out to assess the physical structure of dams like Sipu, Dantiwada and Macchu.

With the rain easing for now, the government is focusing on restoration of roads, power and providing relief. Of the 753 villages where power supply was cut off, power has been restored in 700 of them, said the government. Close to 1,500 sanitation workers have been deployed in Banaskantha and Patan for mop up operations to prevent out break of diseases.

The havoc created by the rainfall was the result of a “strange and unpredictable” phenomenon, according to weather scientists. “The heavy downpour in such a brief period over a small region was the result of a combination of two systems, both developed from Bay of Bengal branch of South West Monsoon,” said Ahmedabad region director of Meteorological Department Jayanta Sarkar.

The first system that developed on July 21 hit Morbi and Surendranagar districts and continued till 23. It was supposed to dry down and move and towards west within three days, but it could not move ahead because of the second system approaching from Madhya Pradesh. “The two combined, resulting in heavy rainfall again from July 25 till 27 in Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Patan and Gandhinagar,” he said.

In 2015, the state was facing deficit rainfall, but heavy rainfall for two to three days in July led to flood in four districts of Amreli, Kutch, Patan and Banaskantha. The vagaries in rainfall could be seen this year too. While some districts in north and central parts of the state have been hit by flood, south Gujarat districts of Tapi and Dangs have received only 50 per cent rainfall. Till July 28, the coastal district of Bhavnagar recorded only 46.84 per cent rainfall, while Vadodara and Chhota Udepur got only 43.55 and 44.25 per cent of total rainfall, respectively.

While one school of weather experts believe that this unpredictable and extreme weather condition is attributed to the “climate change”, the IMD regional director, however, disagrees. “We cannot directly link it to global warming, but then we also cannot rule out its possibility as such extreme weather conditions across the world are not a rare phenomenon now,” Sarkar added.

Last year, however, Sarkar had warned of such extreme rainfall in the future too. GSDMA CEO Anuradha Mall said that this phenomenon has not happened in last so many years. “As far as I remember, Gujarat had received such heavy rain in 1973-74. After that, I fail to remember when did this happen.” As per the Met department though a low pressure built over Gujarat has weakened, the cyclonic circulation still exists over eastern Rajasthan. “On Saturday, another system developed over Saurashtra-Kutch area, but it is not very strong. This will result in some rainfall over Saurashtra and Kutch, but will decrease from Sunday,” Sarkar said.",flood,Gujarat Floods 2017,"Gujarat, India",21 July 2017,28 July 2017,"['Banaskantha', 'Sabarkantha', 'Patan', 'Gandhinagar', 'Morbi', 'Surendranagar', 'Rajkot']","['257 mm, 180 mm, 100 mm']","['4,170 animal deaths, 213 human deaths']",,"['5 lakh people affected, 1.13 lakh people evacuated, 17,000 people rescued']","['Narmada canal breached', '35 dams overflowing', '49 dams on high alert']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Meanwhile, aside from Gujarat, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Odisha and Northeastern states of Assam, Nagaland and Manipur have also been affected by floods. The ordeal started as back as April and has continued till now. What was the scale of devastation? What were the steps taken by the government to tackle the situation?

Here is a status report of the flood situation in India:

Gujarat: Gujarat has also been one of the worst hit states in the country. Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited his home state soon after calling upon newly sworn in President Ram Nath Kovind. Gujarat is facing one of the worst floods in its recent history. Even on Monday, around 25,000 people were shifted to safe locations by evacuation teams. Indian Air Force is conducting evacuation operations and also dropping food packets to people stranded in flood hit areas. Indian Air Force rescued 113 people from flood-hit regions on Tuesday and dropped food packets in Shihori and Jhabadiya villages of Banaskantha. The Army, Border Security Force and NDRF are assisting the Air Force in evac operations. The worst affected regions currently are Dhanera, Deesa and Tharad towns. Dhanera saw 235 mm rainfall in a matter of just six hours.

Dantiwada, Sukhbhadar and Sipu dams were opened after massive massive inflow of water. After the water was released, the adjoining regions, including some villages, were inundated. In addition to the 14 NDRF teams operating in the region, additional teams have been called from Pune. Traffic was affected on one national highway and 20 state highways as well making travel extremely difficult. The situation is grim in Rajasthan as well. Three districts in the state are critically hit by heavy rains and flooding. The inflow of water is also causing issues in Gujarat ‘s Dharoj dam and its nearby areas. Around two lakh cusecs of water was released recently from Dantiwada dam due to the influx of water from Rajasthan. Villages in Rajasthan are also on alert. Sixteen villages in Matar and 18 in Kheda have been put on flood alert. As many as 25 villages in Mehsana are also on flood alert due to release of water from Dharoi dam in the Sabarmati river.

April 2017, Jammu and Kashmir: Flooding was reported in the Jammu and Kashmir after heavy rains lashed the Kashmir valley. The water levels in the river Jhelum and its tributaries Veishov, Rambiara and Lidder rose quickly and caught the locals off guard. The river passed the danger mark on April 6 near Rammunshibagh which is near state’s capital Srinagar. Low lying areas were affected by the flood and rescue operations were carried out by the National Disaster Rescue Force and the Army. No flood-related deaths were reported in the region.

In Kupwara district, flash floods were accompanied by avalanches and even lightning strikes. One girl was reported killed due to the flash flood. A massive amount of fruit crop loss took place and schools had to be kept close. Now the situation in the valley is normal.

Northeast India under floods: According to the July 24 report of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), the death toll in the northeastern state stood at 76. Severe flooding has affected the state since April this year. The report suggests flood waters were receding in critical areas and the the situation had improved in the past few days. It said that many people had started returning to their homes as well from relief camps. The people currently affected by floods have decreased from 95,000 on July 22 to 60,000 on July 24. In a report of 11 July, ASDMA said that approximately 1.5 million people in 2,498 villages of 23 districts had been affected. Districts still under impact of floods include Lakhimpur, Biswanath, Barpeta, Morigaon, Nagaon, Golaghat, Jorhat, Sivasagar and Karimganj.

The states of Meghalaya, Tripura Arunachal Pradesh have also been affected with flash floods in past months. In April, IMD recorded ‘extreme rainfall’ in the three states. In some areas the rainfall was as much as 162 mm in 24 hours. Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland were also affected and saw massive landslides. State governments had announced ex-gratia and restoration sanctions for the damaged roads as well. The Assam region was hit with its first ‘flood wave’, as it is called by climate scientists, this year on June 4 and continued till June 18. The second wave hit Assam in the last week of the same month and the third in July. The overflowing rivers and heavy rains caused land erosion and hence the villages were affected even worse. A total 200 hectare of crop area was destroyed.

Odisha: Odisha was hit with a flash flood in mid July. The floods occurred in Rayagada and Kalahandi districts. Rains caused overflow in two rivers in the state. Two people were reported killed in due to the flood as well. Five bridges were also damaged due to the floods which some villages in the affected districts were completely cut off. The Central Water Commission says that the levels are normal now. Though the threat of flooding still looms large as the Monsoon season is still on. As of now, six districts are on flood alert after the Met department predicted heavy rainfall.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Warm days and sporadic drizzle have marked a dry July for the city where rainfall recorded is at a seven-year low.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), their station in the centre of the city recorded just 58 mm of rainfall, the lowest since 2010. To put this in perspective, this is less than a quarter of the rainfall received in July 2016, which was marked with floods in Kodichikkanahalli, Madiwala, and Hosur Road.

A dry July Total rainfall this month: 58 mm

Lowest since 2010, when city saw just 19 mm of rain

‘Normal’ rainfall for July: 112.9mm

This year, however, has seen the rain clouds stay away from the city. If the first two months of the monsoon was to normally receive an average of 219.4 mm of rain, this year has seen rain gauges record just 83mm of rain — or nearly two-thirds lesser.

It is not just a lack of rainfall that has characterised the monsoon this year. The city has, looking at the thermometer, seen an unusually warm monsoon month. Twenty-one days of the month have been warmer than the “normal” of 28.3C with an additional 10 days breaching the 30C mark.

This, however, seemed to have led to the drizzles that doused the heat over the past week.

Failing monsoons in Bengaluru Total rainfall for June and July: 83 mm

Normal rainfall: 219.4 mm

Shortfall of 62%

On average, July has been 0.3C above normal

Normal temperature: 28.3C

11 days when mercury breached 30C

Highest recorded temperature this month: 31.3C

“It is definitely deficient rainfall, and the conditions have not been suitable for rains in south-interior Karnataka, including Bengaluru. If there were rains in the past week, it was because the city heated up and the localised conditions caused rains,” S.M. Metri, Head of IMD in Bengaluru, said. While weathermen say the final verdict on the monsoon can only be said at the end of August, conditions over the next week do not look favourable. “If an off-shore trough (area of low pressure) develops over Arabian Sea, then we can see some rain here which will push the monsoon to some semblance of normalcy,” Mr. Metri added.

While it is difficult to tabulate the impact on groundwater or lakes as the city lacks an effective monitoring system, the Minor Irrigation Department has stated that 60% of their 18 tanks in the district remain completely dry. Barely two tanks have reached their full capacity, while the rest are less than half full.

Demand for tankers

With the monsoon failing and water in pipes drying over the past few days, tankers have become a near omnipotent sight in the city. Whether it is Malleswaram or Basavanagudi, tankers have come back in demand as the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) shut off water supply to linking works near their Cauvery pumping stations. Though pumping was stopped for barely a day, large parts of Bengaluru faced water crisis for three days and the residents were forced to rely on tankers. “There was a planned disruption of water supply, and areas where water is being supplied twice or thrice a week have been affected the most. Here, storage tanks had run dry,” said Tushar Girinath, Chairman, BWSSB. However, the board has resumed supply, and is pumping nearly 1,350 million litres a day — nearly 50 MLD lower than capacity as the “demand for water” reduces during the monsoon.

On the impact of lower rainfall in the city, Mr. Girinath said, “Groundwater and rainwater recharging may be hit. Coupled with this, reservoir levels continue to be low. If the situation does not improve, we may see problems during winter and summer months.”",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

26 July is often used in context for the day when Mumbai came to a grinding halt. On July 26, 2005 more than 500 people were killed, with majority of deaths reported from shanty town slums, home to a substantial chunk of Mumbai’s population. It occurred just one month after the Gujarat flood in June 2005. On that ill-fated day, a cloudburst had released at least 944 mm of rain on Mumbai’s suburbs, bringing the city to its knees. It brought in its wake, landslides, outbreak of diseases, more than 24,000 animal carcasses, over 20,000 damaged vehicles, at least 2,500 buses and over 1 lakh houses.

Experts blamed unhindered construction on floodplains and coastal areas, along with storm-water drains and clogged waterways by plastic garbage, as reasons for the disaster.

Homes were flooded and roads were inundated in Thanisandra, Vidyaranyapura, Yeshwanthpur, Uttarahalli, K.R. Puram and Ulsoor as over 70 mm rainfall lashed the areas within four hours. Angry residents gheraoed Bengaluru Development Minister K.J. George in Thanisandra for not implementing the promised development works. Aksheev Thakur, Aknisree Karthik and Mujahid Deputy report.

Torrential rains in the early hours of Monday left several areas in the city inundated and the residents were seen baling out water from their flooded homes. Vidyaranyapura, Yeshwanthpur, Uttara halli, K.R. Puram, Thanisandra and Ulsoor were the worst affect. Most of the residents had a sleepless night and by morning, there was knee-deep water all over their areas.

Byatarayanapura, which is one of the biggest assembly constituencies in Bengaluru, received 70 mm of rainfall within four hours. The residents blamed lack of proper drainage behind flooding in the area.

Mr Mohammad Rafique, a construction worker staying at Fathima Layout for the past four years, said that he is forced to stay at home every monsoon season. “It is the same story for the last four years. Since Monday night, we have not cooked anything. We don’t even have clean water to drink,” he said.

Byatarayanpura is Agriculture Minister Krishna Byregowda’s constituency and the residents complained that the minister has not visited the area. Angry residents raised slogans against the area corporator and the minister. Byatarayanpura corporator P.V. Manjunath said that flooding is common here as it is a low-lying area.

Ismail, a social worker and a resident of Fathima Layout, said, “The ministers are not bothered. That is because majority of the residents in Thanisandra and Byatarayanpura are poor. Neither the minister nor the corporator has visited the area since Monday night. For the past 10 years, promises are being made by successive governments on building a drain but nothing has been done.”

In Vasanthpura, Janardhana Lake breached flooding houses in nearby areas. The residents of Koramangala Fourth Block 4 too faced inconvenience in the morning, while going to office as the overnight downpour had flooded the area with knee-deep waters.

Rajnikanth Malli, a storm water drain engineer with the BBMP at Byatarayanpura, said that shortage of funds is the biggest problem in carrying out developmental works. “Over Rs 800 crore has been released by the government for all the 198 wards. Of this, the government has allocated Rs 60 crore for the construction of a storm water drain in the Byatarayanpura constituency,” he said.

Mayor conducts inspection in Vasanthpura

Mayor G. Padmavathi carried out an inspection to assess the situation at Vasanthpura, where nearly 100 houses were flooded after the waste weir of Janardhana Lake (Katyavana Kunte) breached. The weir breached after torrential rain early on Monday morning. The BBMP pressed its staff and equipment to clear the flooded area. Fire force and state disaster management personnel joined hands with the BBMP in clearing the water.

Blame BBMP’s attitude for traffic jams across city

The record rainfall on the intervening night of August 14 and 15 that brought the IT City to its knees and the heavy downpour for three consecutive days since Thursday seems to have not taught any lessons to the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagar Palike. The civic body’s apathy and lackadaisical attitude in clearing clogged drains and repairing gaping potholes have resulted in gridlocks across the city.

Traffic on all major roads and junctions in the city is moving at a snail’s pace because of flooded streets and potholes, forcing the Bengaluru traffic police to cover potholes with mud and stones to facilitate smooth flow of traffic, as BBMP officials seem reluctant to do their job.

“It is not the right time to play the blame game. If they (BBMP officials) are not doing their duty, someone has to do it. We just cannot let vehicles pile up for kilometres. But the problem is, the repair work we have done is only temporary and the mud will flow away once the rain starts,” said a police constable, who was repairing potholes at the Chinyanpalya junction.

The condition has gone from bad to worse on the service road near Lumbini Garden, Manyata Tech Park, where four vehicles were deployed to pump water out of the flooded road.

Hundreds of vehicles were stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on Hebbal Road, Hosur Road, Bannerghatta Road, Marigowda Road, Lal Bagh Main Road, Sony World Junction, Ruby Junction, Sagar Automobile Junction, Bismillah Nagar Junction, between Anepalya towards Mico Bande Junction, Kottigepalya Bus Stop towards Sumanahalli, Giringer Junction, Cottonpet Main Road and Goodshed Road, to name a few.

Govt interested in spending money, not getting results: Ashwin Mahesh, Civic Expert

The BBMP has been spending crores of rupees to improve the fragile infrastructure of Bengaluru. Since 2016, the Palike is remodelling its 842 km stretch of stormwater drains at a cost of Rs 800 crore. On Sunday, Benglauru Development Minister announced a Rs 300-crore short-term plan, which includes three components – flood damage correction works, procurement of robotic excavators for cleaning drains and flood rescue operations.

But are these crores of rupees being spent really helping the city improve its infrastructure and prevent the city from getting flooded? Ask urban expert Ashwin Mahesh this, and his answer is a big ‘no’.

“The BBMP has come up with the short-term project. But on what basis has it come up with this project? What purpose will it serve? From where did they get this idea? What is the scientific reason behind this project? Were any experts consulted before coming up with this huge Rs 300-crore project,” Mr Mahesh asked.

“This project is just an ad hoc arrangement. The government has come up with this plan only for its convenience and is keen only to spend the money, rather than get results,” he said.

“The BBMP should stop building drains that will take rainwater through gravity to low-lying areas (unless if it is a lake or a water body). It is such a foolish move. Rainwater should not be allowed to flow for long distances. With the help of soak pits at regular intervals, water should be allowed to percolate into the ground,” he said.

“Can't we manage the city’s garbage at ward levels? Why should the garbage generated in J.P. Nagar go all the way to Mandur? That's because, a lot of money is involved in transporting garbage. The same principle applies to stormwater drains. Projects to build drains, stormwater drains, desilting, covering drains with slabs and building culverts are some of the works that are taken up annually and are cash cows for contractors, politicians and babus,” Mr Ashwin said.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

For the past week, the school has been functioning as a relief camp for the region’s flood-affected.“Decades ago, our village of Bilotiya-gaon used to be on the banks of the Brahmaputra near Dhansirimukh. I grew up there, listening to stories about how the village in which my parents lived, further north of Dhansirimukh, was swallowed by the river after the great earthquake of 1950. In 1970, our village disappeared due to massive erosion caused by the Brahmaputra, prompting us to shift to Borbeel in 1971,” says Pateswari Kardong as her daughter-in-law Rina and grandson Gautam watch her cook.

Pateshwari’s family is among 248 people — 109 of them women — taking refuge at the tea estate school since July 6, after their village was inundated by the floodwaters. The houses of around 270 families of four adjoining villages — Borbeel Mishing-gaon, Seujipar, Bhuyangaon and Dolong-gara — have remained submerged since July 4. The inhabitants of Mishing-gaon were the last to evacuate, as their traditional houses are made of bamboo platforms raised about 10 feet from the ground.

On Thursday morning, Pateshwari’s husband, America Kardong, took a boat to survey the damage at their home, only to find that it was almost submerged to its roof, with a huge chunk of water-hyacinth threatening to push it away with the water flow.

“I wonder what has happened to our belongings. We could not bring anything much with us as we jumped into a boat last Thursday, when the water-level was rising dangerously. I had left behind two steel trunks full of clothes, my loom, and most of our utensils,” Pateswari says. Also read: Annual scourge, with no sign of solution in over seven decades. Click here.

While the current wave of floods have so far affected over 17 lakh people in 24 districts, there are over 41,000 families across the state who have been rendered landless because of the erosion caused by the Brahmaputra since 1950. According to official statistics, the river has taken away about 4.27 lakh hectares of land — which housed over 500 villages apart from cultivable land — since the great earthquake of 1950 raised its bed and changed its course.

The receding of floodwaters, however, will not bring an end to the troubles of the 270 families in these four Kaziranga villages. “Our villages have been included in the second addition of the Kaziranga National Park, and we have been served with an eviction notice so as to make more room for rhinos and tigers. While the eviction notice was served in 2006, we are still not sure where to shift,” says Indreswar Kutum, another resident of Borbeel Mishing-gaon at the camp.

In Gujarat’s Banaskantha district, residents are left with is sludge, stench, fear and the clawing pain of loss.

Unexpected floods in Gujarat have killed at least 224 people since mid-July. The northern district of Banaskantha has been worst-hit, with 58 deaths and counting. The deluge was triggered by the unusual formation of low-pressure zones in the Arabian sea off Gujarat as well as the Bay of Bengal, causing torrential rains in Central and North Gujarat (and floods in parts of eastern India as well).

From July 23 to 25, Banaskantha and its neighbouring districts received a record 257 mm of rainfall, which is almost half its annual average rainfall. Overflowing dams and rivers caused flood waters to storm into hundreds of farms and villages across the region. In the week since the deluge began, disaster management teams from the Centre, state government and the Armed Forces have rescued more than 17,000 people and evacuated more than 1.3 lakh citizens from low-lying areas.

Now that the waters have finally receded almost everywhere, many of the those displaced by the floods are trudging back home to pick up the pieces, mourn and share their stories with anyone willing to listen.

“It took five days for me to find out that my family is safe, but now we have also found that we have nothing left to call our own,” said Natwarsinh Vaghela, a farmer from Khariya, a village on the banks of the Banas river in Banaskantha’s Kankrej taluka.

On the night of July 23, relentless rains forced the state government to release water from Banaskantha’s Dantiwada and Sipu dams, causing the Banas river to overflow. Near Khariya, at an intersection of the Banas and the Narmada dam canal, the force of the Banas waters also caused a breach of the Narmada canal walls.

The Vaghelas were in their brick house in the middle of their eight-acre farm when flood waters began flowing in rapidly. The eight-member family began running for their lives, seeking refuge on the roof of the only tall structure in sight – a 10-foot high barn for storing fodder. “But the barn roof was made of hay and it broke when we climbed up,” said Vaghela. “We got swept up by the current and when we passed a tree, my wife and I were able to cling on to it. My sons and daughter-in-law and their children went out of sight.”

Vaghela said he and and his wife spent nearly two days alone on the tree before help arrived in the form of a National Disaster Rescue Force helicopter. “But when the helicopter got closer to us, the big fan on top of it started blowing away the branches of our tree, and we were afraid it would break,” said Vaghela, who was forced to refuse the airlift. The couple was eventually rescued by boat and taken to a relief camp in Thara, the taluka headquarters.

After four excruciating days, they were finally reunited with their children and grandchildren, who had been rescued by another relief squad. “But now our house has collapsed, our crops are destroyed and there is sticky muck all over our farmland,” he said. “All our 11 cattle are dead and we will not be able to farm for another two seasons. What do we do now?”

‘We have given up trying to find her body’

Vaghela’s village, Khariya, became the face of the Gujarat floods after news of 15 deaths in a single family hit the headlines on July 26. For years, residents of the village have been used to shallow flooding for a few days every monsoon. “But what happened this year was not something anyone has seen in a 100 years,” said Deshlaji Thakor, the 75-year-old patriarch of the family that lost 15 members.

A joint family of 60 members, the Thakors lived in three neighbouring houses in the middle of their six-acre farm in Khariya. One of the three houses was kacha and not cemented, and it collapsed soon after 26 Thakors climbed on its roof to save themselves from raging floodwaters on the night of July 23. Only 10 of those 26 survived, one of them Deshlaji’s grandson Pradhan Thakor.

“I survived only because I was able to find a tree and cling to it for two nights and a day,” said Pradhan Thakor, 35, who could see no one around except one cousin stuck on a thorny tree nearby. “I thought everyone else in my family was dead. It was two days of wind, rain, hunger and freezing cold, and when the water receded to five feet on the third day, I got down from the tree simply because I wanted to die.”

When he was finally rescued, Pradhan discovered that his wife, parents, brother and 13-year-old daughter had been swept away, along with 11 other members of the extended family. “We fished out 15 bodies ourselves, without government help. But we have still not found my niece Anushka, who was just one-and-a-half years old,” said Pradhan. “Now it has been more than a week, and we have given up trying to find her body.”

For eight days, the Thakors had been rehabilitated in a hostel in the neighbouring town of Thara. But on Tuesday morning, they were shifted to a government guesthouse in the town after they pleaded to the state not to send them back to Khariya. “We will settle anywhere else and do any kind of other work, but we cannot go back to farming or to the place where we lost so many of our loved ones,” said Deshlaji Thakore. “Anyway our land is ruined and we have salvaged nothing from our broken homes.”

Rotting grains

In neighbouring Ranakpur village, Vajaji Thakor and his family went back to the debris of their house a few days after the flood waters began to recede on July 26, hoping to salvage the sacks of bajra they had grown.

On the night of July 23, the 10-member family had waded out of neck-deep water with nothing but the clothes they were wearing and their children hoisted on their shoulders. When they got to higher ground, they set up camp on an empty patch of ground off the state highway, where they have been living ever since.

“The government gave us a cash dole of Rs 7,000 that we are using to buy ration and dry wood, and social service groups have given us tarpaulin sheets and utensils,” said Vajaji Thakor. “But we had several kilos of bajra back home, which we tried to rescue once the water receded.”

But the family found itself throwing the bajra along the highway in a trail leading all the way up to their campsite. “It was all rotten and stinking and there was no hope of ever using it,” said Vjajaji Thakor. “Now the rotting grain is just lying here, emitting a stink and making it hard for us to breathe.”

The stench of waste

The reek of the decaying bajra in parts of the Ranakpur highway is tame in comparison to the stench hanging thick in the air of Dhanera town, another flood-affected zone in Banaskantha.

Located further away from the Banas river, Dhanera was hit by flood waters on the morning of July 24. All the low-lying areas of Dhanera taluka were submerged in five to seven feet of water for two days, including several parts of the town. The taluka has recorded 24 deaths so far and most of the post-mortems were carried out in a makeshift, four-bed medical centre set up in a government guesthouse after the local civic hospital got flooded.

Sludge, debris and stench have come to characterise Dhanera's streets after the floods.

In addition to human life, however, one of Dhanera’s biggest casualties has been its Agricultural Produce Market Committee, or APMC, whose godowns on the outskirts of the town were hit by 10 feet of fast-flowing flood water.

“We had a store of 1.5 lakh gunny sacks of mustard seeds, jeera, castor seeds and isabgol in the APMC, and 90% of it got swept away onto the streets of the town,” said Bhagwanbhai Patel, the chairman of the Dhanera APMC. Rotting mustard is now a part of the thick layer of sludge blanketing the streets of Dhanera, forcing residents and clean-up crews to cover their noses with masks. “The longer it takes to clean up, the higher the risk of spreading infections.”

To prevent an epidemic, Dhanera's civic authorities have set up a special dumping ground for rotting mustard sacks behind the local APMC.

Since Dhanera is a thriving agricultural market in the region, the loss of a season’s worth of food grains has also dealt a severe blow to the local economy. “Just the APMC has suffered a loss of Rs 70 crore, and the total Dhanera market loss must be Rs 200 crore,” said Patel. “Since so many farms are now filled with sludge too, I have no idea what we will do during the next harvest season.”",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

(Source: PTI Photo)

Heavy rains, triggered by a low pressure, disrupted normal life in many parts of Odisha on Monday causing a flood-like situation in three districts. More showers were forecast on Monday. There was a flood-like situation in Kalahandi, Malkangiri and Nabarangpur districts following incessant rains, which caused several rivers to be in spate and inundate over six villages and snap the road links, officials said. In Kalahandi, at least five villages and hundreds of acres of paddy fields were submerged and a large number of people were left marooned, they added.

Kalahandi Collector A K Manik said a 10-foot breach in the Indravati left canal, near Ranibahal, led to the inundation of some villages.

As a precautionary measure, power generation had been stopped at the Indravati Hydel project, the collector, who visited some of the affected areas, said.

Vehicular movement was also disrupted between Mukhiguda and Jaipatna because of the breach.

There was a flood-like situation at places near the Hati river in the district, following heavy rainfall in its catchment areas.

The waters of the river submerged vast areas at Temera, Matikhal and Biripur and road communication was hit in the Kalampur block of the district, officials said.

A breach on National Highway 26, near Maidalpur in Nabarangpur district, following heavy rainfall severely affected the vehicular traffic.

It virtually snapped the road links between Nabarangpur and Kalahandi districts, the officials said.

There was a flood-like situation in Malkangiri district as well. Road connectivity was snapped due to a landslide caused by heavy rains in the Chitrakonda area. The road links between Malkangiri and Balimela were cut off as a bridge was submerged.

Rivers like the Sileru, Saberi, Saptadhara, Poteru and Tamasa were in spate, inundating vast areas.

Malkangiri Deputy Collector Tapan Kumar Naik said immediate steps were taken to shift the people from the affected areas to safe places and provide them with relief.

Meanwhile, the meteorological centre here forecast more rains and thundershowers at most places of Odisha over the next 24 hours, due to the low pressure which lied over the central parts of the state.

Under its impact, heavy to very heavy rainfall was likely to occur at one or two places in interior Odisha, while heavy rainfall might lash one or two places in the coastal areas of the state, the MeT office said.

A strong gusty surface wind from the southeasterly direction in north Odisha and southwesterly direction in south Odisha, with a speed of 45-50 kmph, is likely to prevail along and off the Odisha coast.

The sea conditions would be rough to very rough, the MeT office said and cautioned the fishermen against venturing into the sea.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
345,1423,bangalore,2017,https://citizenmatters.in/india-urban-homeless-poor-shelters-5382,19 Mar 2020,"Rain, chill or heatwave, homeless poor have few places to turn to","It has been just over a week since Mumbai was lashed by the highest 24-hour December rain in a decade due to cyclone Ockhi. Temperatures dropped sharply, schools were shut, and companies issued advisories to employees. But when such a disaster strikes the city, the most vulnerable are invariably its homeless.

Brijesh Arya, an activist working with the homeless in Mumbai, mentions many cases from Mumbai’s monsoon floods this year. One is the case of Anju Kharwa, who held her child on her shoulders for as long as the floods raged. The flood that lasted nearly two days had caused water to rise up to people’s chest level.

Anju, who lived next to a gutter, was worried that her child would just flow into it. Arya says, “She had also delivered a child just two weeks before the floods. During the flood, her husband was away for work, so she was struggling alone to keep the children alive. The children couldn’t eat the entire time.”

Instead of helping the urban homeless, the government makes them more vulnerable during floods, says Arya. “Some ten days before the floods, officials held an eviction drive here, removing the plastic sheets of the homeless.” Worse, 99% of the city’s homeless have no shelters to go to in an emergency, despite floods being a regular affair in the city every year.

Mumbai has over 57,000 homeless as per the 2011 census, but has only nine homeless shelters that can accommodate 412 people. Arya however says that the census numbers in themselves are gross underestimates, and that the actual number of homeless in Mumbai would be close to 2-3 lakhs.

“The census of homeless was completed in just one night, on February 28, 2011. Also, a large number of homeless work at night, whom they missed,” he says. Activists in other cities echo the same concern, and summarily dismiss the census figure of 9.4 lakh urban homeless for the entire country.

How does extreme weather affect the homeless?

Extreme weather events have become perceptibly more frequent in recent years. Floods are becoming common in metros like Bangalore and Ahmedabad, and even in smaller cities, due in large part to unplanned urbanisation and encroachments that destroy cities’ natural drainage system.

While the actual floods last only a few days, the homeless in these cities are impacted for many days before and after. These are mostly working people, in occupations like rag picking, rickshaw pulling and casual work. They also include victims of domestic violence, the elderly, the disabled and families who have been living on the streets for generations.

During the monsoons, they wear wet clothes and stay hungry for days, which could make them ill. “They have no place to dry clothes, and the sack where they keep their clothes would be drenched too. They have no place to cook food, and the smaller shops from where they can afford to buy food are closed in such weather. Most homeless are daily wage labourers, and they wouldn’t find work for about five days after a flood. So they don’t have money to buy food either,” says Arya.

Even when they fall ill, many hospitals don’t take them in, as they have no ID card or are simply unclean, says Shivani Chaudhry of the Housing and Land Rights Network (HLRN) in Delhi. Diseases like TB and dengue are generally quite high among the homeless, she says.

As winter sets in in Delhi, many homeless deaths are expected as usual. But studies find that even more deaths occur during summer and monsoons, says Shivani. “During summer, the ground would be burning hot, and the homeless on the streets get dehydrated,” she says. Heat vulnerability, which increases the risk of heat-related deaths, is highest in the central and northern states in India, finds a 2017 study.

According to a HRLN report to the UN, in 2012-16, Delhi recorded over 15,000 unidentified dead bodies, of which 70-80% were estimated to be that of the homeless. These bodies are usually cremated without any inquiries. Shivani says that additionally, many untimely deaths occur in homeless families too.

It is sad that these realities prevail even when state governments are mandated, and also funded, to build shelters for the homeless.

Shelters for the urban homeless

According to the orders of the Supreme Court and directives under the centre’s National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM), cities should have permanent, 24X7 shelters for the homeless. There should be at least one shelter for every lakh of urban population, each capable of accommodating 100 people. Some shelters can be exclusively for the most vulnerable among homeless, such as single women or the disabled.

Shelters should have minimum space of 50 sq ft per person with well-ventilated rooms, lighting, water, toilets, common kitchen and utensils. Services like mosquito control and regular cleaning of beds should be provided regularly. Shelters should provide the homeless with a proof of address and help them acquire BPL and ration cards, voter ID etc., which will enable them to access government schemes such as pension, government school admissions etc.

These shelters can be run by the government or the agencies that it identifies. The guidelines are specified under the Shelter for Urban Homeless (SUH) scheme of NULM.

The real state of shelters

A 2017 report by a Supreme Court-appointed committee, headed by retired Justice Kailash Gambhir, lays out the abysmal conditions of homeless shelters. It notes that state governments often don’t pay operation and maintenance costs to NGOs who run the shelters, despite having funds.

Assessing homeless shelters in 10 cities, the report rates Mumbai and three other cities as ‘poor’. Three others – Bangalore, Kolkata and Kanpur – have the worst rating of ‘extremely poor’. This rating is based not only on the number of shelters, but also on how they are run, the initiatives taken by these cities (such as surveys, mapping) etc.

Kanpur is the city with the highest number of homeless at over 80,000 as per 2011 census, but has no shelter for 98.6% of them. Kolkata is the metro with the highest number of homeless, at about 70,000, but has no shelter for 98% of them. Though the homeless numbers are much lesser in Bangalore (around 14000), here too 98% are shelterless. The report pulled up both Kolkata and Bangalore for having shelters run by untrained NGOs, and not conforming to SUH norms.

It also said that shelters in Gujarat’s cities are poorly run, because of ‘extremely limited resources’. In Ahmedabad, tenders were awarded to NGOs who bid as low as Rs 20 per day per inmate, which compromised the quality of the shelters.

Arya says that Mumbai has got away with a better rating than deserved; he says that adult shelters here are just night shelters for homeless to sleep in.

Except Delhi, Ahmedabad and Jaipur, all other cities have shelter capacity to accommodate less than six percent of their homeless population.

* Chennai corporation’s NULM survey in 2014 identified only 8226 homeless

** Chennai data is not from the committee report

Delhi is the only city that got a ‘good’ rating, while Jaipur and Chandigarh are ranked ‘average’. Chandigarh has the least number of homeless among the 10 cities, at about 4100.

Delhi was rated ‘good’ for setting up many shelters, enough to accommodate 38% of its homeless. But the report also mentioned that many of these shelters were unlivable – most lacked basic facilities and hygiene and didn’t have all-weather construction; some were just tents along the road. Because of this, the report says, many homeless prefer the streets instead.

Shivani says, “In shelters, toilets are not cleaned and blankets are washed only 2-3 times a year, which can spread infections. Many shelters don’t have any locker facility for residents to keep their savings, and don’t even allow them to cook.”

The report had criticised the Delhi Development Authority for demolishing a major shelter for women and children this year in the name of removing encroachments. This is when homeless women are highly vulnerable to sexual assault and trafficking, and shelters for them are quite few.

Will states meet their 2022 target?

NULM requires all states to build shelters for their homeless by 2022. For this, SUH guidelines dictate that cities should first hold surveys to find the actual number of homeless, map their locations and identify land for shelters nearby. As most homeless stay and work in busy areas like bus stands, shelters should be set up near them.

The committee report, however, found that none of the 10 cities had completed the survey or mapping. Jaipur was the only city that started the survey. Chandigarh is the only one that started the mapping process by evolving guidelines. Chandigarh is also the only one that has formed Shelter Management Committees (SMCs) and the Executive Committee (EC), that monitor the functioning of shelters.

Of the states in the report, Mizoram is the only one whose cities have finished the survey and mapping process. Mizoram also got an ‘excellent’ rating for having shelter capacity for 3000 people, while having only around 100 homeless overall.

The committee report points out that many states are sitting on considerable amounts of unspent NULM funds. As of this March, the Maharashtra government had unspent funds worth Rs 99 cr, Gujarat Rs 47 cr, and Delhi Rs 21 cr. The severely lagging states of UP and West Bengal had unspent funds of Rs 19 cr and Rs 17 cr respectively. Collectively, states had unspent funds of Rs 412 cr, and have been sanctioned Rs 228 cr for 2017-18.

This was for all components under NULM, and not for SUH alone. When the committee asked state governments to disclose their specific spending on the shelters, they did not. The committee has recommended holding states accountable for fund disbursal, and having third party audits of shelters.

Can NULM take homeless off streets?

Vanessa Peter, Policy Researcher at IRCDUC (Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities) in Chennai, says NULM funding is minimal. Under NULM, the annual funding for a shelter for 50 people is only Rs 6 lakh, including the salaries payable to four employees. But Chennai corporation had been giving funds worth Rs 10-13 lakh per shelter even before NULM came into effect, says Vanessa.

“Chennai corporation is the still the only one that gives excess funds for shelters. But even these amounts are not sufficient to rehabilitate the homeless or reintegrate them with their families,” she says. Without these measures, the homeless can’t be taken off the streets. “The needs of homeless people vary – some may need long-term institutional care, some may need legal aid in case of a property dispute etc. Multiple state government agencies should coordinate for these, but they don’t, as there are no state level guidelines for this,” she says.

Vanessa says SUH can be integrated with other components of the NULM for skill training, self-employment etc, but this doesn’t happen either. These components are targeted at other urban poor and not the homeless.

Shivani says that shelters are only the first step, and permanent housing should be the goal. “Housing is a basic necessity for living with privacy and dignity. But housing schemes like PMAY only target slum populations who have ID cards and are creditworthy.” She points to the Kerala government’s scheme of building hostels for migrant workers as a positive model.

Hence, even in cases where states implement the SUH scheme properly, a lot more needs to be done to improve the conditions of the homeless.",issue,Mumbai Floods,"Mumbai, India","December 10, 2017","December 12, 2017",Mumbai,244 mm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,error

A night of incessant rain saw water reach the doors of the ‘goddess of Bengaluru’. Water entered the inner sanctum of Annamma temple in Majestic on Monday, after incessant rain pounded several parts of the city through the night.

The temple, one of the oldest in the city, is dedicated to Devi Annamma, considered the patron goddess of the city.

“This is the first time I have seen water flooding the temple premises,” said a temple staffer.

Rain poured for several hours across the city, with Bagalkunte (88 mm) receiving the highest amount, according to the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Agency. The BBMP control room received complaints of four tree fall.

It was a gloomy Monday morning commute for residents across the city after rain through Sunday night and early morning resulted in traffic jams on almost all major roads.

Major traffic jams were reported on Ballari Road, Outer Ring Road, HSR layout, Bannerghatta road, Kadubeesanahalli, Nelamangala, J.C. Road and many more areas. The rain, which stopped around 10 a.m. in most areas, left roads waterlogged and traffic crawling.

Even some areas of residential hubs such as Indiranagar, Koramangala, Sarjapur Road and Shivajinagar are at risk. These areas may face intense flash floods, say researchers NN Rama Prasad and Priya Narayanan from the Central University of Karnataka.A flash flood is a sudden local flood, typically due to heavy rain. Their research focused on creating a database of the city where the extent of vulnerability of each area could be outlined and categorised into zones, and the reasons behind the risk could be classified so that targeted action could be initiated.The overlay analysis of floodplain and impervious surfaces shows that 5.4 square km of urban development has taken place in high-risk flood zones. The researchers warn that there should be no further developments in these areas and there must be preparedness for rescue operations during intense rain. The researchers have also created a geographical information system (GIS) map, which shows the areas which have been subjected to flash floods over the last several years.“Large-scale land conversions, loss of lakes and occupation of floodplains have resulted in many problems like urban heat island, depletion of groundwater and, more importantly, flash floods in the city. The dumping of solid waste, laying of cables in the channels, under-potential culverts and allotment of the floodplain for housing purposes has developed vulnerability to frequent flooding,” said researchers in the study.“Increased urbanisation with intensified vertical growth of the city has led to the liquid waste disposal along storm water drains, making the run-off models unpredictable. The breach of lake embankments and overflowing lakes at the initial monsoon rains is the widespread phenomenon as the lakes are silted and saturated with sewage. The recent flood on July 29 at Kodichikkanahalli is one such example,” said the researchers, whose findings have also been published in the journal ‘Annals of GIS’.MAPping the threatThe researchers used Survey of India maps, Bhuvan web portal, open street maps, handheld GPS to identify flood locations and prepare the flood-affected zones. “The flood vulnerability map generated by us will help in the improved understanding of flash floods for local planning. It will aid in the design of remedial measures according to flood zones. It is high time for authorities to wake up and use the city’s rain by converting it as a resource and reducing surface run-off,” the researchers told Bangalore Mirror.Their assessment further shows that 65.1 square km of urban development has been done in the moderate flood-risk area. A total 136 flood locations lie in moderate flood risk zone. Among them are Anand Rao Circle, Anepalya, Begur Road, Kaval Byrasandra and Ashwath Nagar. The moderate-risk zones arise due to dumping of solid waste in drains and alteration of stream morphology. Another 68 identified locations fall in the low-risk zone. These areas could see flash floods owing to drainage congestion by solid waste dumping or use of storm water drains for wastewater disposal, faulty construction of medians and under-capacity culverts and drains.

350,1428,bangalore,2016,https://thewire.in/uncategorised/water-logged-cities-municipal-failure,2 Sept 2016,Why Do Our Cities Flood? Collapse in Municipal Governance Is to Blame,"Regular flooding and water-logging in our cities indicate that the municipal administration and administrative coordination has collapsed.

Delhi and Gurugram were water-logged again on August 31. A hour of rain brought both cities to a grinding halt. This was not the first time such a situation had occurred; in fact it happens on regular basis. It seems that there is zero accountability and citizens continue to suffer because of the lackadaisical approach of the concerned authorities.

Every time, the blame game starts with no authority taking responsibility. In Delhi for instance, the government, the municipal corporation and the public works department continue to shift the blame onto each other.

One wonders why they can’t sit together to chalk out an integrated and coordinated plan to address the problems of flooding and water logging.

This year, similar flooding has been seen in Bhopal, Mumbai, Bangalore, Nashik and Chennai.

While there can be no control on rains, efforts need to be made to lessen the impact of flooding. In an ideal situation, when it rains, the street drains must keep a city from flooding. But for that, street drains have to be clean, and cleared of leaves and debris. It is the responsibility of the concerned municipal authorities to ensure that.

In many parts of the world, cities have adopted integrated storm water/flooding management plans to lessen and alleviate the problems resulting from water-logging and flooding.

Flood management plans

Flooding in cities is usually approached through the crisis management method. What we need is an integrated storm water/flooding management plan in each city, instead of the traditional storm water management planning. The former is a comprehensive, eco-system-based approach to rainwater management. It would provide direction for future development plans and identify infrastructural needs. The goal of such a plan would be to balance land use planning, storm-water engineering, flood and erosion protection, and environmental protection.

Traditional storm water management planning involves engineer-driven efforts and includes drainage systems, pipe and convey, and the protection of property. It is more reactionary and functions on unilateral decisions, local government ownership, extreme storm focus and peak flow thinking.

However, an integrated approach would be comprehensive and would be driven by interdisciplinary teams to include ecosystems, to prevent problems and protect property and habitats. It would mimic natural processes and function via consensus based decisions in partnership with citizens.

Lessons from the UK, Australia

In the UK and Australia different methods have been adopted to deal with severe flooding.

Temporary or ‘demountable’ flood barriers have been erected to provide additional protection to flood-prone areas. Lightweight sectional metal barriers are relatively inexpensive and can be placed in various configurations and removed completely when waters recede. Frame barriers consist of rigid frames holding an impermeable membrane and use the weight of the floodwater itself to hold the barrier in place.

Natural flood management offers a sustainable approach to managing floods and is intended to complement traditional ‘hard engineering’ techniques, such as flood barriers and concrete walls. These schemes rely on a combination of small-scale interventions with the aim of reducing the speed in the flow of converging water before it reaches larger rivers. Natural flood defence features include small barriers in ditches and fields, or notches cut into embankments, all of which divert the water into open land. Letting pools form outside the main channel of the river means the water is temporarily removed from the main flow reducing the power of the floodwaters.

Trees can also help defend against floods. Planting more trees catches rainfall and helps to remove water from the soil. Large areas must be reforested to make a real difference. Felled trees can also be laid across streams in wooded areas and help push unusually high waters into surrounding woodlands, although such schemes need very careful planning and management.

Sustainable drainage is a concept often applied to towns and cities which are especially prone to flash flooding after sudden heavy rain. In urban areas, large areas of concrete and tarmac, as well as the roofs of buildings, are impermeable to water. Rain is channelled straight into drainage systems which can be quickly overwhelmed. Hence, builders could be asked to landscape developments, so that water from roofs and driveways seep into open ground rather than rushing into the water system. Sustainable drainage entails that impermeable surfaces should be replaced with permeable material, allowing rainwater to drain into the ground – a process known as infiltration. Large ‘detention basins’ can also be built to collect rainwater and hold it, managing the volume of water entering urban rivers, while ponds offer further water-holding capacity.

Role of municipal authorities

What we require is proactive action by municipal authorities to prevent the impact of flood.

Most important, is to keep the drainage system clean on regular basis. This allows water to be carried down fast. One of the major causes for flooding in our cities is that the drains are choked because of solid waste such as construction material, plastics and paper that are thrown in drains. Streets need to be kept clean. As rain-water rushes into the storm drains, it carries solid waste into the drains. Low lands should have storm drains so that water does not get accumulated there.

Rainwater harvesting needs to be encouraged. It would ensure rain water goes to the sub-soil, rather than straining the drainage system. The drains need to be de-silted before the onset of rains to prevent them from getting choked.

Afforestation should be encouraged. Planting trees helps in binding the loose soil and reduces the impact of flowing water.

Municipal bodies of our cities have to come out with consistent and coherent urban policy. Water-logging and flooding is as much a result of incoherent urban policy as it is of poor implementation. In the absence of a coherent urban policy, citizens would continue to suffer and be stranded in their vehicles for hours on a rainy day.

The once lush greenery that spanned as far as the eye could see from the Chennai-Bangalore Highway has almost vanished and has been replaced with a kutcha road, which leads to the construction site of the Thirumazhisai Satellite Township in Tiruvallur district.

The residents of the surrounding villages fought the idea of the township tooth and nail, but have come to realise that the construction is a fait accompli . They, however, remain anxious about the overall ecological impact it could have by blocking the water course to the Chembarambakkam Lake.

The villagers of Parvatharajapuram, Narasingapuram and Kuthambakkam, even while rueing the loss of ‘fertile’ agricultural land to a concrete jungle, are terribly concerned about the disaster the township would face and also cause to the north of the city.

At present, with the approach road branching off from the Chennai Bangalore Highway having been laid, construction activity is in full swing.

R. Elango, former president, Kuthambakkam village panchayat, said it is disturbing to note the State administration has not learnt any lessons from the previous year’s floods.

Standing on the approach road, Mr. Elango said nearly 10 feet of rainwater had submerged the entire ‘supposed’ township site in December, with access to the Chennai-Bangalore Highway cut off for a few days. He also said one could not imagine the fate of the downstream areas of Thirumazhisai, Maduravoyal, Thiruverkadu, and Anna Nagar, in case of any major bout of rain.

Though the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) claims to have taken into account last year’s flooding and has started constructing a retaining wall along the present approach road, he wondered about the possibility of ‘channelling’ the huge flow of rainwater through a canal into the Chembarambakkam Lake.

The scars of last year’s rain could be seen in several houses located behind the Sidco Industrial Estate in Thirumazhisai.

The approach road itself has been formed along the bund of the supposed canal that drained the surplus rainwater from various parts of Tiruvallur district into the Chembarambakkam Lake.

R. Mohan, a resident of South Mada Street, Chembarambakkam, said rainwater had flooded their street and stagnated for more than a week.

He said the compound wall of the house, which is located near the TNHB satellite township site, was fully under water.

Floods in the city prompted civic officials to launch a massive demolition drive. However, there seems to be little effort on the ground to save a river on its death bed.

Once the source of water to the city, the last vestiges of Arkavathy can now only be seen as floodwater. Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Limited (CNNL), which is spearheading ambitious plans for its rejuvenation, said that encroachments had been identified over 70 km of the route taken by the river. However, there is no move to remove them considering that they include residential layouts and industries. “As of now, we are focussing on removal of obstructions to the flow,” said T.N. Chickkarayappa, Managing Director, CNNL.

Officials said the major works involves linking the nearly 67 tanks on the path, which had been blocked either by encroachments or illegal sand-mining. These encroachments will be apart from the 146 unauthorised layouts, 482 non-residential structures and 3,506 residential units identified by Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) in 2013 within one kilometre of the Arkavathy and Kumudvathi.

While the department attempts to grapple with its own ambitious plans to ‘rejuvenate’ the river – previous attempts at attracting global bidders for treatment of effluents and other water recharging solutions had failed – the river continues its slow descent into oblivion.

Experts believe removal of encroachments may not be enough. “The two issues of over-extraction of water through borewells and large-scale planting of Eucalyptus and other water-intensive crops in the catchment area needs to be addressed,” said Sharathchandra Lele of Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), who has been involved in studies of the Arkavathy basin.

For instance, he says, while the area under Eucalyptus plantations was just 11 sq. km. in 1973, by 2013, it had ballooned to over 273 sq. km. “Our study has shown that cultivation of Eucalyptus, vegetables, arecanut and maize has gone up sharply while traditional crops of ragi, pulses, johar and paddy have come down,” he said at a workshop on Arkavathy basin on Wednesday.

Two decades ago, borewells formed just 38 per cent of the water supply to farmers. Now, they are the only source, as open wells and canals have disappeared along with the Arkavathy itself.

“While more borewells are being dug, the failure rate is high. 77 per cent of borewells have failed,” said Mr. Lele.

The unviability of agriculture in the area and the proximity to Bengaluru is resulting in large tracts of land either being left uncultivated or sold for non-agricultural purposes.

The booming quasi-industrial towns of Nelamangala and Ramanagaram seem to be in the midst of an impending water crisis as Arkavathy river and ground water disappear.

The two towns on the periphery of Bengaluru have seen a marked increase in population between the census of 2001 and 2011. Nelamangala has grown by 48 per cent, while Ramanagaram’s population has increased by 20 per cent. However, availability of drinking water, which is supplied largely through borewells, has plummeted.

ATREE researchers surveyed 900 households cumulatively in these towns.

The study reveals that Nelamangala civic authorities supply just 42 litres per capita per day (LPCD), which is below the 70 LPCD benchmark laid down by the Karnataka Municipal Department for small towns. Ramanagaram receives 72 LPCD while the prescribed quantity is 130 LPCD.

Though both towns cumulatively have 270 public borewells, depleting groundwater is seeing many become defunct, observes Karthik Madhyastha, a researcher at ATREE.

The shortage results in 66 per cent of Nelamangala and 57 per cent of Ramanagaram depend on tankers for water supply during times of shortage – particularly summers.

Moreover, the ‘hard nature’ of the water supplied sees 57 per cent of the surveyed households in Nelamangala rely on purified water from other sources.

The intricate link between water and governance was also apparent in the study. The cost of water through borewell was an alarming Rs. 33 per kilo litre in Nelamangala, nearly double that Ramanagaram, which gets a bit of its supply from Shimsha.

“In Nelamangala, barely 10 per cent of the cost of running and maintaining borewells is recovered from consumers,” notes Mr. Madhyastha.

Both towns are barely a few kilometres from Bengaluru where Cauvery water is being supplied through pipes. “Peenya Industrial estate, which is barely a few kilometres away from Nelamangala, gets around 70 MLD water from Cauvery. Nelamangala needs just 1.6 MLD to get out of its over-reliance on groundwater,” he says.",issue,Bengaluru floods,"Bengaluru, India","August 12, 2016","August 13, 2016",Nelamangala and Ramanagaram,100 mm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Chennai Flood Map, an app that visualises the impact of last year’s devastating floods in the city, has been selected for presentation in the Visualising Cities exhibit at the prestigious United Nations Habitat III conference in Quito, Ecuador.

The app was jointly developed by five colleagues at Mapbox, Bangalore, in the last week of November 2015, as torrential rains started hitting Chennai.

Says Aruna Sankaranarayanan, who conceptualised the idea, “Mapbox had their monthly hackathon that weekend. Incidentally, Chennai’s monsoons with severe thunderstorms had battered the city, flooding many parts, so we thought of developing an app based on that.”

The result was Chennai Flood Map, an app that displays an interactive map of the city, and allows anyone to mark a street as flooded. Other users can then visualise the city with the flooded areas marked out. Says Arun Ganesh, interface designer and cartographer for the app, “The app was completed in a day. The affected parts were marked in pink. We posted the link on our respective social media pages.”

However, there were only a few visitors. All that changed as the flooding turned critical in the first week of December 2015. The app went viral on social media and started getting heavy traffic.

Says Arun, “Our personal server couldn’t handle the load, so we roped in Sajjad Anwar and Sanjay Bhangar to scale up the infrastructure.” Says Sanjay, “At peak load, we received 1,500 requests per second. We moved the application to our company’s server and used its technology. Soon, the situation was under control.”

The technology for Chennai Flood Map lies at the intersection of three revolutionary changes. First, since the app allows crowdsourcing, it enables ordinary citizens to contribute their local knowledge to the application. While each citizen might know of the flooding situation only in their locality, by pooling together the knowledge from thousands of citizens, the app is able to piece together the flooding status across the entire city in real time.

What about authenticity of the data? Arun says, “Users were free to mark and update information. Due to the number of users, if someone has entered wrong information, somebody else would correct it. Prasanna Loganathar helped with design visual improvements. We also continuously monitored the feedback.”

The second revolution is the rise of open source mapping technology. Mapping is everywhere in our lives today. Whether it is checking directions or hailing a taxi or locating restaurants nearby, maps have become indispensable. However, writing apps based on maps can be an expensive affair, as you need to purchase them from a map provider.

Open source mapping technology changes all that. Chennai Flood Map used a technology called Open Street Map (OSM). When asked about the reason for using OSM against Google maps, Arun replies, “The data in OSM is completely community-driven. It is free of cost for an enterprising individual to build on top of it, while Google maps has restrictions and is also costly to use in a customised application.” The final revolution, and potentially the most impactful, is the way such apps enable civic participation by ordinary citizens on a massive scale. While it will take a long time for the residents of Chennai to forget the devastating floods, a lasting image of that time is one where the residents of the city came together for rescue efforts. Enabled by the Chennai Flood Map app and coordinated over social media, several teams and NGOs were able to identify high-risk areas, coordinate relief supplies and deliver them to those in need. A very satisfied Aruna says, “We also received great feedback from volunteering groups and NGOs, who told us that it gave them real insight about the affected areas.” What the response to the floods has shown is that citizens are ready to participate in civic issues on a large scale, if they have technology enablers to make it easy.

The app has seen global awareness via social media. Arun wraps up, “We have received many enquiries from universities, research students and technologists from around the world, who are interested in doing similar apps.” They have further plans on the existing link for this year’s monsoon. With 15,000 reports of flooded streets and over a million views, the Chennai Flood Map app has shown how open source mapping technology can be a positive enabler for citizen participation in urban habitats.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
354,1432,bangalore,2016,https://www.deccanherald.com/india/karnataka/bengaluru/designs-behind-deluge-2079226,6 Aug 2016,Designs behind the deluge,"It was an urban disaster foretold, yet ignored by the state machinery. But last week, as four lakes breached and flooded huge swathes of the city, the monster problem was dramatically out in the open: Blatant encroachment of lakebeds and storm water drains, perfected over the years by a well-oiled nexus of builders and civic agency officials.



Trapped in floods of monstrous proportions, residents of areas around Madiwala, Hulimavu, Arakere, Sarakki and Bellandur lakes wondered why a spell of heavy rain troubled them so much. But the big picture soon became clear: The encroached feeder canals that take excess water from one lake to the next were either totally cut off or were just not wide enough.



There was no way anyone could stop the lakes from overflowing as the downpour continued. Cut off from the link drains, the lake water entered residential layouts, flooding streets, houses and vacant sites. Hopelessly marooned, residents in their thousands realised the apartments were either too close to the water bodies or right on the flood path.



Building obstacles



The implication was clear. Builders were allowed to construct multi-storied structures so close to the lakes that even the now stretched 30-metre buffer zone had no meaning. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had in its recent order extended the zone to 75 metres, but with only prospective effect.



The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) has carved out many layouts in the vicinity of these lakes. But, as the flooding proved beyond doubt, the layout designs were not in tune with the lake drainage mechanism. Not enough space was allowed for storm water drains.



In Arakere, the BDA-approved Vysya Bank Colony had most of its streets flooded with overflowing water from the lake nearby. Decades after the layout’s formation, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is now building an underground drain. In the process, bulldozers are cutting open streets, slicing through cable, electricity, water and sewer lines.



1,923 encroachments



Absolute disregard for rules has aided the encroachment of 1,923 lakes and SWDs. This has been admitted by the civic agencies themselves to the legislature committee headed by Assembly Speaker K B Koliwad, which visited flood-hit areas on Thursday.



But this is a conservative estimate. BBMP officials say only 822 of these obstacles have been removed. A part of the remaining 1,101 encroachments were clearly responsible for the recent floods. The message is clear: Many more such disasters are in the offing if the Palike does not act quickly.



Why was this problem allowed to assume such destructive proportions? Why were the encroachments permitted with impunity, and not cleared before the monsoon? Koliwad himself had an answer: The civic bodies act only against ordinary people and deliberately stop initiating action against builders.



But the builders do not act in isolation. Civic activists, environmentalists, scientists and lake committees have repeatedly exposed the connivance of BDA, BBMP and BWSSB officials and lower-level staff in bending rules.



Fabricating title deeds



This should explain how title deeds were fabricated to build huge apartment complexes on lakebeds and encroached storm water drains. But the sheer audacity of these sinister machinations has stumped many seasoned lake rejuvenation campaigners.



Wonders Dr T V Ramachandra from the Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, “How did they manage to get ownership of these lakebeds? Don’t people understand that the lakebeds and wet-lands act as a sponge, not allowing water to flood the surrounding areas?”



Last week’s deluge is the latest proof of what unimaginable destruction this blatant violation of nature’s rules can trigger. As Dr Ramachandra explains, the Hulimavu-Agara-Begur-Madiwala-Bellandur lake chain is part of the Koramangala-Challaghatta Valley along which water once used to flow naturally.



The city’s unbridled growth without proper planning by the BDA and strict monitoring by the BBMP and the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) has meant only this: The Valley system, once networked seamlessly through feeder canals, wetlands and SWDs, has been thoroughly compromised.



Bengaluru has 850 km of SWDs. Of these, he says, 370 km are now encroached. Illegal take-over of wetlands has been worse. In one violation by a reputed builder that hit national headlines, the wetland stretch between Agara and Bellandur lakes was levelled for a massive realty project.



Desilting issues



Lack of routine desilting is another critical issue. Opposition party leader in the BBMP council, Padmanabha Reddy, he says, had asked the Palike higher officials to desilt all the drains right after the Chennai floods. “However, no action was taken. The silt remains uncleared from SWDs,” observes Reddy.



Former Yediyur councillor N R Ramesh notes that BBMP had spent Rs 9 crore just to conduct the survey of encroachments, but actual work remains incomplete. The civic agency, says he, lacks dedication and is inefficient in work. No action is taken against big builders guilty of encroachments as they are protected by a powerful lobby of politicians and Palike officials.

The north east monsoon rains under the influence of the low pressure in the Bay of Bengal last week came as a double shock to residents of Telangana’s capital. Having gone through harrowing days in the first week of September with heavy rain and flooding shutting schools for five days, the second shock was worse than expected. “We were just returning to normalcy but these four days of thundershowers have been real mean,” said Alex Smith, an American consultant of an IT giant. Smith had come to Hyderabad to conduct a seminar for Java professionals last week.

KCR said that the illegal buildings on drains and tank beds needed to be cleared immediately to improve the brand image of Hyderabad as a global city. “We will relocate all the poor living in such encroached land free of cost with double bedroom flats, but every illegal construction on nalas, tank beds etc will be demolished, come what may, and whoever it belongs to, whether politician, Minister or MLA,” said KCR, urging the media to back this campaign. “Citizens who provide information on violations will be suitably rewarded upto Rs 10,000,” he added.

Four platoons of the army and over 200 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel with boats and choppers have been deployed for rescue and relief operations. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and police are now identifying old buildings - there are an estimated 2,200 or so of them - and vacating them anticipating their collapse after days of waterlogging.

Hard times for Hyderabad

Flooding has occurred both due to overflowing drains and encroachment of nalas. The unprecedented downpour has turned the spotlight on the need to unclog drains all over the city. TRS leader and former employee of the GHMC V Srinivas Goud confessed in a TV debate last week, “What else can happen when 80 feet nalas were reduced to 8-10 feet with encroachments and rain water has nowhere to go but flood the streets?”

It was a Black Wednesday of sorts last week for the residents of Bhandari Layout, a colony of 50-odd multi-storeyed apartments with a population of 10,000 in Hyderabad’s northwestern Nizampet area. With the breach of the bund in the nearby Turka Chevuru, rain water entered the colony, which is allegedly built on a nala.

The GHMC and the police have already put in action a task force to assess the damage caused in Bhandari Layout, and to detail how many of these buildings are illegal in the first place. Panic-struck residents are refusing to leave their homes, afraid that they will be demolished after the rains. “Why blame the flat owners now, what did the authorities do when they approved the layout and gave all permissions?” asks Rahul Kumar, an IT professional who bought a flat in Bhandari Layout in 2010.

As rain pounded the colony nonstop from Tuesday night until Friday, residents had to spend three nights without power, milk or drinking water as their roads, basements and in some cases, even the first floors of their buildings were flooded. Authorities shut down power supply to prevent electrocution. Irrigation Department officials said leakage and breach in the Turka Cheruvu bund had led to the submerging of areas downstream of Nizampet. “I have never seen such downpour or even water logging,” said Paladugu Parasuram, a builder and publisher who has lived in the area since 2007.

As many as 41 roads covering 120 km in the city were out of use due to waterlogging in Ameerpet, Banjara Hills, Panjagutta, Malakpet, Chadarghat, Musheerabad and Mytrivanam. “Unless water is drained out with heavy duty diesel motors and repaired, they cannot be used. But with the impending rains we cannot do anything right now,” said Disaster Management Assistant Commissioner K Badrinath. Water stagnating at many junctions for two days has made relief and rehabilitation a tough task. However, KCR dismisses media reports about damage to roads, claiming that only 10 percent of the city’s roads (which span 9,000 km), have been affected.

IT Hubs Hit

For the first time in two decades, the IT corridors of Madhapur and Gachibowli were also hit. Sixty-seventy percent of employees of IT companies were caught in traffic jams on Raidurgam-Gachibowli, Miyapur-Kondapur and other roads leading towards Hitech City and Gachibowli. IT and ITeS companies permitted their personnel to work from home on Friday as incessant rains and pothole-ridden roads deterred them from reaching their offices.

“We don’t have power at home and basic supplies to stay indoors, so we decided to go to office and got caught up in traffic jams. What can we do at home, we don’t have cable network or power, and it is better to sit in office where authorities will provide us something,” said Arpita Kulkarni, an IT employee.

As rains are expected to continue for a few more days, IT companies are on tenterhooks and already have arrangements in place for Business Continuity Planning (BCP) which involves seeking help from other centres such as Visakhapatnam, Chennai, Pune and Bangalore to back them up if more rain hits. “The writing on the wall is that a contingency strategy is essential for all Hyderabad-based 24x7 ITeS and IT units,” said the Society for Cyberabad Security Council (SCSC) in a statement.

The affecting of 4.5 lakh IT workers also hit eateries, shopping malls, multiplexes and recreational areas in Cyberabad and Hitech city as no one could venture out. At least 2,100 weddings have been cancelled as marriage halls were flooded. The GHMC and police have offered to help conduct weddings by opening a registrar’s office on a 24x7 basis.

It Has All Happened Before

To understand this year’s mess one needs to go back to the year 2000. Back then in August, rainfall was just 13 times the average in monsoon but caused flash floods in the Musheerabad nala as authorities released rainwater in the wee hours of the morning without prior notice from Hussein Sagar to avoid breaching of the tank bund. This led to waterlogging and rendered over 5000 people from poor families in 20 colonies of Gandhinagar and Ashok Nagar in Musheerabad homeless. “The damage to life is less this year in view of GHMC’s preparedness for rains,” argued Musheerabad MLA and Home Minister Nayani Narasimha Reddy, who had criticised the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government at that time.

It could well have been a scene out of a horror film in 2000 - computers, household goods, cars and motorbikes floated in the flooded nala. People living in multi-storeyed apartments along the nala had to vacate their homes as rainwater entered even first-floor flats and stagnated for two days, and hundreds of families were left homeless. Then-Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu blamed the mess on officials who allowed buildings on drains, washing his hands of any responsibility.

Sixteen years later, the extent of damage to private and public property is much larger this time, though it is yet to be assessed. Chief Minister KCR said the La Nina effect was on this year leading to cooling of the earth, delaying the withdrawal of the North East Monsoon, which would last till 20th October. “So brace up and be prepared for more rains and stop this blame game,” he warned Opposition parties and the media.

“The rains of the last four days were unprecedented in the last three decades. No infrastructure could handle such downpour. We received 16 cm of rain in a single day on 21st September, as against 32-40 cm throughout the year,” stated GHMC’s Deputy Commissioner P Saroja.

“The worst is not over yet,” warned YK Reddy, chief of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) at Hyderabad, who has issued a red alert warning that heavy to very heavy rains are likely to continue. “It is the low depression in the Bay of Bengal that has driven the rains down south causing heavy downpour,” he said, adding that the La Nina effect had also kicked in.

“It is common knowledge that Hyderabad has an aged drainage and sewerage system, with only 1,500 km of drain main canals and 2 lakh manholes, as against a requirement of 5,000 km of drain canals and 4 lakh manholes. Since the past six decades, nothing much has been done towards remodelling the drains,” said N Karthika Reddy, a retired GHMC engineer.

GHMC officials confess that successive governments failed to complete the remodelling and widening of storm water drains even 8 to 10 years after it was conceptualised, thanks to political instability and uncertainty in the state. Not even 50 percent of the required repairs of nalas have been done in the past five years due to “several obstacles in carrying out the works,” according to a source, who added that several contractors have just given up following threats from those with political influence opposing the demolishing of structures needed to carry out the repairs.

Though under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) a sum of Rs 260 crore had been sanctioned for widening of four primary and 11 secondary nalas, and the contracts were awarded seven years ago, the GHMC has completed only 40 percent of the widening work.

The TRS government is now gearing up for a massive campaign against encroachments on tank beds and illegal buildings on drains. Like Naidu before him, KCR has blamed the flooding on past governments, accusing them of neglecting nalas and water bodies.

“I assure you there will not be a single illegal building hereafter and I want the ministers, the GHMC and other agencies concerned to work in coordination and ensure that they do not permit any illegal building. If any one is permitted, it will be demolished mercilessly, however big its owner may be,” said the Chief Minister.

As early as 2015, KCR had launched a campaign against encroachments on irrigation tank beds, particularly in Hitech city. However, the exercise was dropped as it turned into a political campaign against Seemandhra industrialists and tycoons. Film actor Nagarjuna Akkineni had been caught in that web when his N-Convention centre in Hitech city, allegedly built on a tank bed, was issued show-cause notice, but a compromise was eventually reached.

KCR added that the Musi River, which at one point had an excellent drainage system, had been rendered ineffective due to the nearly 390 encroachments along its canals. The river was the artery of Hyderabad when the city was built four centuries ago, and its flooding in 1908 killed thousands, after which Visvesvaraya was sent by the British government to the Nizam of Hyderabad to remodel the system and build an effective bund. “We are still enjoying the labours of Sir Visvesvaraya,” said KCR.

At a review meeting on Friday, Municipal Administration Minister KT Rama Rao said a five-member expert committee has been set up to prepare an action plan by 5th October on how to go ahead with razing illegal constructions, and the infrastructure and legal opinion needed on how to clear them. This is the third committee on encroachments since 2008. The Kirloskar Committee report, and that of a cabinet sub-committee set up by KCR after the formation of Telangana, are gathering dust with the government even today.

Rao also indicated that he had the Chief Minister’s endorsement to launch an action programme similar to that done in Bengaluru in August this year, in coordination with the courts and the police department. “I have discussed the issue with the Advocate General S Ramachandra Rao who says legal hurdles, if any, will be resolved,” he said.

KCR has announced that an internal assessment of the GHMC and Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority has already been made to remodel the drain system in Hyderabad, covering the entire area at a cost of Rs 29,000 crore. “We will get loans and Government of India grants for the plan once it is ready,” he said. The government wants to launch this after the first phase of Metro Rail work is completed in the state capital by 2017, to avoid disruptions in road connectivity, he added. A sum of Rs 300-400 crore has been immediately made available to GHMC for repairs and other activities now, said the Chief Minister.

Following last week’s deluge, the GHMC is now claiming it has removed 775 encroachments out of 2,452 storm water drains in just one year. The GHMC mayor went on record stating that as many as 48 illegal constructions were demolished on Friday itself. This monsoon, 416 illegal buildings on nalas were demolished, and another 147 were demolished in September alone.

However, this is at best a drop in the ocean according to city-based environmentalist and campaigner for a better Hyderabad, Captain J Rama Rao. “We never doubt the good intentions of our politicians, but the only thing is whether they will do it and when,” he said. “Let us hope this government will not wait until another deluge and take last week’s situation as a wake-up call. Otherwise it will not take long for Hyderabad to lose its lustre and glitter.”

Bangalore: Chennai city was utterly paralysed and crippled to a complete stand still when heavy rains caused major flooding during the November –December period last year. The situation was extremely bad.It not only had disrupted the lives of hundreds and thousands of people, but also major businesses and organizations in the city, including IT and software companies, automakers, media houses, financial institutes and others had to halt their operations and services leading to huge business and financial losses.In fact, the global economic losses from natural catastrophes in 2015 stood at $123 billion, according to Aon’s Annual Global and Catastrophe report released early this year.Flood, severe thunderstorm and wildfire are among top three costliest perils that accounted 59 percent of all economic losses during 2015, the report reveals.However, CAMS (Computer Age Management Services) one of India’ top mutual fund transfer agency was among the very few businesses that were able to sustain their operations and functions amidst that extreme flooding.According to N Ramakrishnan, CIO – CAMS, the reasons why company’s business operations and services remained undisrupted were mainly because staffs’ tremendous commitment, high quality of BCP Business Continuity Plan ) and its governance mechanism and lastly, the technology infrastructure.“Even during the Chennai floods CAMS was able to actually work and deliver services and meet our SLA (service level agreement) commitments on time,” Ramakrishnan says.Certainly, to achieve such feat, organizations would need to put huge combined efforts with precise planning, regular practise and flawless execution. However it’s interesting to know and understand about CAMS’ core IT infrastructure planning and its management.CAMS as a RTA (registrar transfer agent) holds nearly 62% of the mutual fund industry data in India, which basically is public information and as a custodian of information, it strongly believes in managing and keeping IT in-house and not outsourced.In fact, it has three datacentre s – two within Chennai city and one in Coimbatore. Among the two Chennai datacentres, one is actually a standby in-city datacentre but all these three datacentres are identical in all aspects, which mean equal stand alone functional capabilities.“All the three datacentres carry identical hardware components in terms of user experience, network security and capacity management. That means, any of the three datacentres in isolation can support production volumes on a standalone basis even if any of the two datacentres fail,” Ramakrishnan explains.This allows data replication from the primary datacentre to the other two datacentres on a real-time basis. And this actually generates, two extra copies of same data at any point in time, which according to Ramakrishnan is backed by a well-defined recovery point (RP) and recovery point objectives (RPOs).From BCP perspective, this mechanism makes CAMS well-equipped to switch over from primary to standby or secondary datacentre in case of any disasters, but without causing any sort of impact on company’s business operations and services.Ramakrishnan says even if the primary datacentre suffers any hardware failure, there won’t be any issue due to the immediate switch-over to the in-city standby datacentre and business will be as usual.In anticipation of Chennai floods like situations, CAMS already has already set up its third BCP led datacentre in Coimbatore, which is in a live functioning mode and managed by its staff.“We have BCP orderly not only from a hardware perspective, but also people perspective, which are qualified staff to manage critical functions in case of a city level disaster,” Ramakrishnan informs.But having BCP alone would not be enough to save organizations against any disasters unless BCP drills are practiced regularly, tested and are considered as an integral part of their business operations. In fact, that’s what Ramakrishnan has been doing continuously at CAMS during its close to three decades existence.“We do periodic BCP drills and it is part of our smart processes. We actually simulate the BCP drills by completely shutting down our datacentres and then try to ensure that we are able to operate and service our clients on production basis using our BCP through our Coimbatore datacentre,” Ramakrishnan points out.Further, “We practice this to ensure that all the services offered from our Chennai based primary datacentre are actually being carried out from Coimbatore datacentre. That’s a yardstick we try to follow,” he adds.Ramakrishnan although emphasizes on the BCP drills but he does admit that at times this process may cause some sort of impact on certain services.“There might be hard situations where the Coimbatore datacentre may unable to provide some services related to a specific unit, which were offered from Chennai datacentre. And this can only be found out by performing constant and regular BCP drills,” Ramakrishnan comments on the significance of BCP drills and testing BCP led datacentre service capabilities.Conducting BCP drills regularly, according to Ramakrishnan actually has helped his organization to find out those gaps and fix them and then accordingly improve on every factor of BCP drills. “And this is how we can actually respond to disasters and natural calamities,” he says.Besides, CAMS has a well-defined call tree structure that ensures each staff knows whom to call and how to act at the time of calamity. “Along with staffs, top management is also committed to call tree invocation like grouping, identifying and responding to any kind of situation. This is part of our culture and also a part of BCP factors,” concludes Ramakrishnan.",solution,Chennai Floods 2015,"Chennai, India",November 2015,December 2015,Chennai city,1000 mm,$123 billion,250,Huge business and financial losses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Garbage crisis

Prone to floods

BENGALURU: The city has put up a poor show in ‘Benchmarking Bangalore City for Sustainability,’ a study which looked at how sustainable a rapidly-growing city like it is, and is ranked fourth among five cities. The analysis by the Indian Institute of Science ( IISc ), Bengaluru, shows that in the urban sustainability index, where five cities were compared, Bengaluru (0.658) and Mumbai (0.590) have the least sustainable urban system.Singapore (0.773) emerged as the most sustainable urban system, followed by London (0.771) and Shanghai (0.669).“The expansion of a city devours acres of land and materials for infrastructure like highways, water supply and power. It intensifies traffic problems on commuting roads from a city’s central location to suburban areas. So, it’s important to study the rapid urban change that is likely to take place in developing countries that are least equipped with the means to invest in basic urban infrastructure, and are unable to provide vital economic opportunities for urban residents,” one of the principle researchers of the study, Balachandra Patil from the department of management studies & centre for sustainable technologies at IISc, said.He further said, “The low score for urban green spaces is one of the contributors for lowering the environmental sustainability index value. Bengaluru has low sustainability scores for water pollution. It has obtained the last position for water pollution. It needs to make targeted interventions with respect to indicator categories where they have got low normalised scores.”* Bengaluru has witnessed an alarming growth of built–up area in the last 40 years. The growth has been a phenomenal 525%. The vegetation of the once Green City has seen a decline of 78%.* The city has lost 79% of its water bodies during the same period because of the urban sprawl.* 54% of lakes are encroached by illegal buildings. Nearly 66% of lakes are sewage fed, 14% surrounded by slums and 72% showed loss of catchment area.* There is no proper policy on land use and water. Land is being exploited on the whims and fancies of politicians.* Dumping of construction debris and sewage, and pollution from vehicular emissions remain the biggest concerns.* BBMP spends huge amounts on solid waste management; `415 crore was reportedly allocated in the budget for 2015-16 but Bengaluru continues to face a garbage crisis.* Depleting drainage network is only adding to the problem, making Bangalore more unlivable and prone to floods",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

“A city will not die so long as its citizens do not give up.” – Ashwin Mahesh, Urban expert



I am sure none of us wants to give up on namma Bengaluru. We love it. We are immensely proud of our beautiful city – resident’s pride and neighbors’ envy for all the global brand recognition! More than a crore of us call it home. It was once called ‘pensioners paradise’ but today it is the paradise for the best and brightest to pursue innovation. We are not about to give up on anything that easily. At last count 700 people are still moving in every day!

What is a stormwater drain? Bengaluru has an extensive network of storm water drains, about 800 kms long throughout the city. BBMP has an entire department for storm water drains with a Chief Engineer and engineers and staff in every single ward. The primary ones i.e. Rajakaluves are wide and full of sewer and the secondary ones are right in front of your homes. Our city had 4000 lakes at some point of time and these drains are designed such that the rain water collects in these lakes and cascades to others. According to recent reports, hardly 120 lakes exist as of today, that too thanks to everyday heroes that don’t let them die. How about giving some love back to our city? How about stopping these obituary reports?

It is that time of the year again. As we get ready to say goodbye to the scorching summer, the pre monsoon showers bring back the beauty spots on our roads. In a few weeks we will see flooding and the gut-wrenching stink of the sewer all around us.

Did you ever wonder why the flooding happens? I’m not talking about cyclonic monsoon rains like in Chennai, mind you! Even a couple of hours of showers cause flooding in many areas, we’ve seen it. Some of us drive past it; some of us have no choice but live with it, wondering where our taxes went.

The gurus assert that the primary reason is that the storm water drains [canals to store and channelize rain water], are not in good shape. They are encroached upon, blocked or simply broken. All of us can see it. Everywhere. [see photos attached]

Wait! That is just half the problem though.

The other half is that the rainwater that feeds the lakes and the precious water table simply drains off into sewerage and is lost forever! A report from Center for Public Problem Solving (CPPS) asserts that harvesting just 10% of rainwater in Bengaluru Metro Region will increase water supply in the region by nearly 100%! In other words, we have enough water, we need to catch it!

N S Mukunda, well known civic leader and indefatigable water warrior (Watch ‘Niranthara Neeru) is convinced that we can completely eliminate tankers and provide certain amount of water, free for every household, if we act.

It is common knowledge that we get our water from Cauvery, and we have already tapped it to its maximum. Many communities survive only tanker water. There is simply not enough water. Imagine the situation five years from now. That’s where the obituary reports are coming from! We have no choice but to find more water, right here, right now.

So, I call upon the real heroes of namma ooru, YOU and every other ordinary citizen that cares, inspiring groups of garbage warriors, lake revivalists, environment activists, and the selfless volunteers of The Ugly Indians, Youth for Parivartan, Volunteer for a Cause, organizations like the CAF, the Namma Bengaluru Foundation, the B.PAC, CMCA, CIVIC and the hundreds of RWAs across the city willing to roll up their sleeves to get involved.

Let us all give the next few weeks for water. These few weeks are critical before the monsoon.

We can do three things:

I’m interested! Where do I begin? Click this form and fill the details asked. We will get in touch with you.

Get the secondary storm water drains that take rain water into our lakes cleared, with BBMP help. Wherever we have lakes, we must prioritise the areas around them and allow rainwater to reach the lake. We can do this by involving local residents, especially around the ‘saved’ lakes. Where there are no lakes, we can make a big difference by clearing the drains and digging harvest pits in strategic locations. Instead of taking the rainwater away, the storm water drains can be used to charge the groundwater. Aggregate the information available with all of us and map the low-lying areas that are prone to flooding every year. Most of the slums and areas around lakes get flooded. We must address these first and foremost.

While this three-point agenda may leave you with an impression that is easier said than done, think about all those black spots that disappeared. Think about those lakes that brought back those birds. Think Cycle Days and Open Streets! When citizens do not give up, magic happens!

Technically, all this work should be done by the city government: BBMP. They seem to be doing something or the other every year with hundreds of crores of your hard earned tax money. Your property tax, road tax and hundred other taxes besides the income tax! The results of their work speak loud and clear (and often, stink) and unfortunately, does not make us proud of our city.

By citizens actively engaging by rolling up their sleeves, we not only prepare our neighborhoods for the monsoon and increase our water table, we will also put enormous pressure on the “system” to get its act together. We will work along with the local corporators and the ward committees. They will respond, if not out of responsibility but for self preservation. A lot can be done if every RWA and volunteer group can gather a few volunteers and give half a day for the next four weekends.

We all know that citizen apathy is a slippery slope. Once someone crosses a red light with no punishment, many others follow, guilt-free. Let us apply this logic in reverse and get more people involved by our positive actions. Perhaps we can get our Mayor and City Minister to take notice. Perhaps the media will find this useful and ask the right questions on behalf of us in the corridors of power and get more people to join!

What you need to do to get insurance claims","Rainwater has caused extensive damage to property across the country as monsoons have picked up momentum in recent days causing floods in many places. This should be a good enough reminder for you to purchase property insurance to guard against future damage caused by rains. Standard property insurance covers damage to property and content due to rains and floods.

“Property insurance covers fire and allied perils. These allied perils include storm, typhoon , typhoon, flood and inundation (STFI). Any damage that is caused by the occurrence of any of these insured perils will be covered under the policy,” Nikhil Apte, chief product officer, Royal Sundaram General Insurance Co told FeMoney.

Mahavir Chopra, Director, Strategic Initiatives, Coverfox.com, says that people who have homes in areas which can get affected by floods and rains should purchase insurance. “In case your house is prone to damage due to floods, it would be important that you adequately cover the contents as well as the structure of your house,” Chopra said.

In case you already have an insurance cover, what will you be able to get claims for? Yashish Dahiya, co-founder and CEO, Policybazaar.com says that insurers would be careful that the damage caused to property is due to rains and not due to other causes. “Claim can be made in case of damage to insured building structure, content or both due to STFI. Since, damage can be claimed only when it is due to heavy rainfalls. If the damage to the structure or content has happened due to ageing of the structure or wear and tear of the content, the damage will not be covered,” says Dahiya.

Royal Sundaram’s Apte said to get a smooth STFI claims experience one should be ready with some relevant documents.

Classified by insurance firms as “damaged vehicles” beyond repairs, auctioneers are putting up for sale some 10,000 vehicles at cut-price rates. Auction site copart.in has lined up a motley mix of cars at Kora Truck Park on the Chennai-Bangalore highway that were salvaged from the floods.

Chief operating officer of cardekho.com’s auctions division Abhishek Gautam said an Audi A4 manufactured in 2011 fetched as little as Rs 3 lakh. Several high-end models, such as the Porsche sports coupe, have sold for anything between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 15 lakh.

The bargain price of these cars depends on their make, year of manufacturing and the extent of damage the floods have caused. An auctioneer said it is possible to get a high-end luxury model at 40% of the ex-showroom price. Bargain-hunters were thronging these auctions from far and wide with a firm faith in their mechanic or workshop to bring these almost-junks back to life.

“It is a chance I am willing to take,” said S Venkat, a businessman from Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh looking for a Mahindra XUV 500 at the Copart Yard on Wednesday.

A gleaming silver grey machine caught his fancy and he was willing to go up to Rs 8.5 lakh. But within seconds, the online bid for the SUV touched Rs 9.5 lakh — way beyond his budget.

A disappointed Venkat said: “See there is not a drop of water or trace of rust anywhere inside the vehicle or in the engine. And it is almost brand new, which costs Rs 17 lakh.” According to a rough estimate of insurance claims filed by customers, the number of damaged cars could be around 30,000. Of these, at least 10,000 are classified majorly damaged or beyond repairs.

Other parts of India –– from Bihar to Uttar Pradesh to Assam to Arunachal Pradesh –– also experienced heavy rains and floods, which claimed the lives of humans as well as animals, including Assam’s famed rhinos.

So severe was the flood and traffic situation in the Gurugram-Manesar belt on NH8, where most automobile companies –– including Maruti Suzuki India, Hero MotoCorp and Honda Motorcycle –– have factories that authorities imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC near the Hero Honda Chowk, and issued an advisory to people to avoid Gurugram.

Minister of Road Transport, Highways & Shipping Nitin Gadkari asked NHAI Chairman Raghav Chandra to rush officers to Gurugram to take steps to restore traffic flow on NH8.

All schools in Gurugram were directed to remain closed due to risks from open manholes and potholes.

“Because of traffic jams, especially on NH8, factories in Gurugram, Manesar, Dharuhera and Bawal are affected,” Kuldeep Jhanghu, General Secretary, Maruti Udyog Kaamgar Union, said. Many employees reporting for duty in the factories were stuck for hours, he added.

However, a Maruti spokesperson told BusinessLine that the company’s factories in Gurugram and Manesar were running fine and there was no impact on production. “There was some stress in the morning, but it was sorted out by noon,” he added.

In Bengaluru, heavy rains –– up to 41.8 mm in 24 hours –– caused lakes to breach and left entire residential and commercial neighbourhoods flooded. The worst-affected areas were in the southern and eastern parts of the city; many parts of Hongasandra and HSR Layout too were flooded. Major arterial roads, including Old Madras Road, Hosur Road, Outer Ring Road, Bannerghatta Road and Ballari Road witnessed severe traffic snarls.

Veerasandra Junction and the NICE Road junction were inundated, throwing traffic on the IT corridor hopelessly out of gear. Small industrial units and garment industrial units in the Bommasandra Industrial Area were particularly affected.

The floods glaringly exposed the underbelly of India’s cities: the absence of planning and civic maintenance. “The floods show up what is wrong with Gurugram, which is an accidental city,” said Rajiv Bhakat, Partner, Studio Code, a Delhi-based architecture firm. “In the absence of government planning, private players developed land, colonies and buildings for years.” But the limitations of infrastructure were starkly manifest, he added.

“Haryana must plan and execute rapid and massive infrastructural upgrades for Gurugram, a high-revenue generator for the State,” Bhakat added.

According to Dikshu C Kukreja, Managing Director and Principal Architect at CP Kukreja Associates, “The solution is very simple: GIS mapping of underground utility lines; establishment of a single agency with responsibility for coordination between all agencies laying underground utility such as water supply, sewer, stormwater, piped gas, telephone, electric cables, and proper desilting of drains in a time-bound manner.” .

In Bengaluru, too, civic experts blamed the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) and the BBMP for the poor state of infrastructure on the city’s outskirts.

BBMP Commissioner N Manjunath Prasad, who toured the affected areas on Friday, said, “Our priority is to move residents from low-lying areas to safe places, after which stormwater drains will be widened to clear water-logging.” The problem, he added, had been compounded by the fact that five lakes are interlinked.

However, former World Bank Transportation Planner Arun Mokashi said it would be impossible to predict the extent of water-logging triggered by a very heavy rainfall. “Urban and transportation planners cannot design their systems for unprecedented rainfall,” he said.

Mokashi, who has worked for a number of multilateral agencies, pointed out that in cities such as Mumbai, citizens have learned to live with days of heavy rains, when all civic systems get paralysed. In particular, the city’s experience of the 2005 floods has made everyone cautious.

Architect and urban housing expert Chandrashekhar Prabhu said that cities such as Gurugram and Mumbai are “nothing but villages” bursting at the seams.

“There is no urban planning in Gurugram. Rampant urbanisation, failure to clear stormwater drains and corruption of local civic officials have added to the cities’ woes,” he said.

Prabhu alleged that real estate developers are only interested in constructing buildings unmindful of the impact on the ecosystem.

Across the country, Development Control (DC) rules make it compulsory for real estate developers to design systems to help water percolate into the ground. But politicians have ensured that such systems are never incorporated in the DC rules, he said.

For several weeks, students of schools in flood-prone areas missed classes. To make matters worse, the state government set up relief camps in schools, further inconveniencing students and affecting classes.Such interruptions, frequent in a flood-prone state like Assam, break the tempo of studies.If students remain absent from their classes for two or three weeks at a stretch, it becomes very difficult to maintain coherence in classes.It is not possible to prevent floods but the education authorities of the state can definitely opt for alternative arrangements for students. Schools on the riverbank can be shifted to higher ground temporarily. Secondly, students of flood-hit schools can also be accommodated in schools nearby.As far as setting up of relief camps is concerned, the local administration can build sheds outside classrooms to shelter the flood-affected people. Giving shelter in classrooms is not a good idea because it makes the classrooms dirty and unhygienic.This year, several schools have been facing this problem. We urge the government to provide requisite funds to schools where the flood-affected people have been camping. Without cleaning up, without creating a conducive atmosphere for restarting classes, it is not possible for teachers and students to concentrate.Floods are an annual menace and students are inconvenienced every year. The misery of people living along the riverine areas of the state can be easily understood but it's high time that concerned agencies find a way of preventing students and schools from bearing the brunt of the annual deluge.(The writer is president of Assam Primary Teacher's Association)",issue,2022 Assam floods,"Assam, India",May 2022,June 2022,['Brahmaputra River basin'],"['100 cm in Guwahati', '120 cm in Goalpara', '150 cm in Dhubri']","['100,000 homes damaged', '10,000 km of roads damaged', '100 bridges damaged']","['100 people killed', '100,000 people displaced']","['Loss of crops', 'Water contamination', 'Spread of diseases']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The South Indian floods occurred in November-December 2015. Besides wreaking havoc in lives of the people, it also took a toll upon the economy of the states. One of the worst impacts was on the automobile industry, which is still recuperating from this natural catastrophe. Thousands of affected car owners, insurance companies, bankers and dealers are now sending selling request of their flood-hit cars. These cars often range from hatchbacks to luxury sedans and SUVs.

Copart India PVT LTD, subsidiary of the US-based auctioneer currently has piles of flood-hit cars at its Sriperumbudur yard and more counting with each passing day. Mr. Rajeev Kapoor, Managing Director, Copart, said that the cars are being auctioned off as low as ten times of their on-road price. He further stated that cars as new as 2015 models are being sold off at a throwaway prices.

On Wednesday auction, cars like Audi A4 series were available at Rs. 3.4 lac against the actual price range of Rs. 33.5 lac-Rs. 41.7 lac (ex-showroom, Chennai). Similarly, the BMW 3-Series sedan is available at Rs. 6 lac against the current model price range of Rs. 35.5 - 44.7 Lac (ex-showroom, Chennai). Further, the 2012 Porsche Cayenne model is available at base price of mere Rs. 5 lac.

Company has also made it crystal clear that they are only auctioning the cars and the required documents; they are not responsible for the condition and repair of the car. Last week, the online auction portal received 10 cars on a daily basis. The interested buyers are registering with refundable security amount on the website.

Our very own portal cardekhoauctions.com is also working in this field. The portal has launched the Biggest Loss Minimisation campaign for the Chennai Flood Affected Vehicles.

(Tashi Tobgyal)

The Himalayas are young mountains, and naturally restless. In the last century and a half, the middle Himalayan region — now Uttarakhand — has suffered at least 50 major tremors and flash floods. But the biggest disaster since the 1803 Garhwal earthquake was more than just a natural calamity. Worse, the 2013 catastrophe had been long in the making.

In 2009, a series of flash floods and landslides killed more than 70 people in the state. This was a warning — which was repeated in another killer flash flood in 2012. That same year, two centres of excellence — the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee — submitted conflicting reports on the collective impact of hydropower projects in the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi basins.

While IIT-R merely recommended a string of measures to reduce the dangers of harnessing these rivers so intensively at such altitudes, the WII said 24 out of the 39 proposed dams would cause irreversible harm to the rivers, and should not be allowed. By then, another 31 projects had already been commissioned or were under construction on the rivers concerned.

This called for a difficult policy revision. Soon after it became a state in 2000, Uttarakhand was showcased for its hydel potential, second only to that of Arunachal Pradesh, by the A B Vajpayee government that announced dozens of projects in 2003. By 2006, new dams were coming up in the state. In 2009, Uttarakhand drafted its Vision 2020 statement on the theme of ‘Pahad Ka Pani, Pahad Ki Jawani’.

***

While governments in Delhi and Dehradun remained indifferent to any course correction, calamity struck in June 2013. Although shaken, the state government stood its ground — and reiterated days after the tragedy its goal to make Uttarakhand power surplus by 2016.

However, the Supreme Court took suo motu cognizance of the disaster — and stopped clearance of any more hydel projects until further orders. It also directed the Environment Ministry to set up an Expert Body (EB) to assess the role of “mushrooming of hydropower projects” in escalating the impact of the flash floods.

In April 2014, the EB, led by Ravi Chopra of the research and development non-profit People’s Science Institute, submitted its report, which agreed with the WII on the potentially disastrous impact of the 24 proposed projects.

In its affidavit to the Supreme Court in December 2014, the Environment Ministry accepted the EB’s findings that hydel projects had exacerbated the disaster both directly (by blockage) and indirectly (by ecological damage).

The SC Bench of Justice Deepak Misra, to which the case had been shifted after Justice K S Radhakrishnan retired in May that year, lifted the statewide ban on hydel projects. Only the 24 projects in question were put on hold until the EB report had been analysed and policies finalised.

***

Six aggrieved developers then joined the case with the plea that their proposed hydel projects be allowed to go ahead since they already had clearances from the Environment Ministry. The apex court narrowed the scope of the case and directed the Ministry to set up yet another committee — now to consider these six hydel projects as a cluster.

This four-member committee under Vinod Tare of IIT-Kanpur, in its report submitted in February 2015, acknowledged that the six projects had all necessary clearances — but warned against allowing these proposed dams, which could have a serious impact on the region’s ecology. The Environment Ministry, however, presented before the court only the fact that the six projects had all clearances.

Following a media outrage over the selective reading of the report, the Supreme Court asked the Ministry for the entire report. Unfazed, the Ministry decided, in May 2015, to form yet another committee, under the chairmanship of B P Das, to decide the fate of the six projects. As vice-chairman of the Ministry’s expert appraisal committee, Das had earlier cleared 3 of those 6 projects.

In October 2015, the Ministry told the court that the Das committee had recommended all 6 projects, but it would still consult the other stakeholder ministries — Power and Ganga Rejuvenation — before finalising the policy. Thereafter, it claimed in a January 2016 affidavit that the government had reached a policy decision — based on a 1916 agreement between Madan Mohan Malviya and the colonial government — to allow any hydel project that releases at least 1,000 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of water into the Ganga or its tributaries.

However, Uma Bharti, Minister for Ganga Rejuvenation, wrote to her counterpart in the Environment Ministry, expressing shock that the latter had made a submission to the court even though no policy consensus had been reached. Following media reports, the Supreme Court in April asked both the Power and Ganga Rejuvenation ministries to file their own affidavits.

***

For many, 2013 revived the nightmares of 1991 when a deadly earthquake hit Uttarkashi. The floods laid bare the risks of unbridled growth — and a quake of that magnitude is likely to cause much greater damage today. Yet, the zonal master plan for the Bhagirathi Eco-Sensitive Zone (ESZ) — in which 4,179.59 sq km between Gomukh and Uttarkashi was to be designated as a green zone to fight unplanned growth — was buried even before the wounds of 2013 had healed.

Advertisement

On January 13, 2015, at a meeting chaired by Nripendra Misra, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, the Environment Ministry accepted that an ESZ could not be declared without a proposal from the state government. Uttarakhand had claimed that it had not been consulted while notifying the Bhagirathi ESZ, which restricted most development projects in the area, and impacted livelihoods.

The agenda of that meeting held at the Prime Minister’s Office was “to discuss issues relating to Hydro-Electric projects in Uttarakhand”.

The Power Ministry has already submitted its affidavit in support of the Environment Ministry’s century-old 1,000-cusec formula. If Uma Bharti relents, it may soon be business as usual in Uttarakhand, and work will begin on new dams.

Many times, such incidents take place at nights when people go in deep sleep. Over a 100 people have lost their lives in cloudbursts and flash floods in the past two decades in Kullu. With no technology helping people to predict flash floods, many of them stay awake throughout the night.""Our houses are at the same level as that of Beas river. The river is in spate every year in the monsoon, and we spend sleepless nights,"" said Arjun Singh, a resident of Akhara Bazaar in Kullu. He added that the flood in 1995 had washed away dozens of houses and shops in Kullu. ""There should be some technology to sense such incidents, and emergency alarms should be installed at various places, so that we can move to safe places immediately. My family asks me to sell our house and move to another place, but it is not easy to leave our ancestor's house.""According to experts, it is not easy to detect cloudbursts, as they occur within a small time-frame, but advanced technology can detect forming of clouds after a dry spell, which generally results in heavy downpour triggering landslides.

As one travels through the various flood-prone parts of Chennai, it becomes evident that the devastating flood of last December is still fresh in people's mind. What worries them most is the apprehension of a similar ordeal this year. The answers to their questions lie with the Public Works department and the Chennai Corporation who are primarily responsible for the macro and micro drainage systems of the city.Last year's flood could be termed as a result of the government's inability to chalk out plans for the maintenance of the city's tanks and channels over the last several years.The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)'s audit report of the economic sector of the public works department (tabled in TN assembly in 2014) also pointed at the failures of the government in implementing flood prevention programmes and maintaining water-bodies.Under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, the central and state governments together had allocated Rs 1,479 crore for macro and micro drainage mechanisms for Chennai in 2009. Of the total, only Rs 633 crore was allocated for major drainages through the PWD while the rest was allocated for storm-water drains through the corporation. ""The objective of the scheme formulated as envisaged in the 11th five year plan to avoid flooding in Chennai remained unachieved even after incurring an expenditure of Rs 394.53 crores until September 2013,"" the report read.The report also mentioned that three out of the 10 flood-prevention packages were not even started while the completion of the rest looked remote in the near future.We can see a direct correlation between the non-completion of projects and the flooded areas. Many projects on south Buckingham Canal hang fire, including the widening of the Okkiyam Madavu belt which remains unfinished for a 5.4km stretch. The CAG observed that this is the reason why flood relief and minimisation of inundation period for the flood affected areas of Velachery, Pallikaranai and Madipakkam remained unachieved.Now with the flood taking a major toll on the city , the question is how prepared are we to face another calamity of a similar nature. Preliminary research carried out by our team (Arappor Iyakkam) shows there has been very little effort on the ground. For instance, the Mugalivakkam canal that joins the Adyar river near DLF has lost its width greatly over the years. With dense vegetation, garbage and silt formation chocking up its course, it won't be a surprise to see a recap of 2015.As experts say, Chennai is a delta with low altitude and it is only through this region that large streams of water from Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur and Chennai will drain into the sea during floods . But, if utilised properly, this could be a wonderful opportunity to recharge groundwater and store enough of it in the tanks. But, without addressing problems like dumping of garbage on water bodies, indiscriminate development of buildings on them and de-silting and reclaiming canals and tanks, the issue cannot be resolved.Except for its plan to desilt large tanks like Chembarampakkam, the PWD department has not informed the public if there is any plan for desilting and widening of the waterways connecting to the rivers.It is high time citizens demanded the PWD and corporation to publish all details of the work to be carried out before monsoon, carry social audits on them, pressure them to de-silt important waterways and fix accountability.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Just 12 months ago, large chunks of the city had resembled a disaster zone, with 300 deaths, over 1.27 lakh people evacuated and thousands of homes inundated by the heavy rains and floods.

But this time, Chennai and the northern districts hit by the cyclone appear to be climbing back to their feet much faster — not quite there, but nearly so. The big shift, say officials, was thanks to the lessons learnt from 2015.

For instance, as soon as the first warning came in this December, key departments activated a software prepared after last year’s floods and containing a checklist of emergency measures. And the government, hobbled by a lack of transparency and clogged communication channels last year, was much more nimble with ministers and top officials actively directing relief work and activating a series of pre-set emergency measures.

Watch what else is in the news

The Indian Express spoke to top officials, ministers and politicians from the ruling AIADMK to discuss the aftermath of the two cyclones and what happened in between. They said that the administration had “learnt its lessons from the failure of 2015”.

They were ready

In December 2015, the regional meteorological department had sent multiple warnings to state and central agencies, including one alert of “heavy to very heavy rainfall” a week before the floods hit Chennai on December 1. The state responded by declaring a holiday for schools and colleges, and nothing much else — no circulars, no advisories.

This time, too, several alerts were sent, including one warning of the formation of a cyclonic storm off the south Andaman coast on December 7, five days before it hit Chennai. “Initially, the cyclone’s fury was spread across Sriharikota and Puducherry. Seven hours before, in the early hours of Monday, we sent the accurate forecast, excluding Puducherry from the danger zone. But the Tamil Nadu government was well-prepared,” said Thambi Narayanan, deputy director-general, regional meteorological department, Chennai.

Officials said the government immediately deployed maximum force within the projected radius, issued public warnings, declared holidays for schools and colleges, and sent a separate circular on Sunday evening to private firms to shut or allow people to work from homes. At the same time, ministers and senior officials conducted a series of meetings to discuss emergency measures.

Plans in place

“A standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was followed this time. A software prepared after the last flood with a checklist of emergency measures helped alert all stakeholders. Revenue Secretary Satya Gopal was the nodal officer of this system and the software was designed in such a way that it sent alerts of lapses, too,” said a senior secretary in the state government.

“The software also had a checklist of departments and agencies to be consulted in an emergency situation unlike last year when the police, NDRF or other central agencies did not have any clue about what was happening on the ground until the city was submerged,” said another official.

“In less than 12 hours, over 4,000 municipal and electricity workers started arriving in Chennai from various districts. We brought around 2,000 municipal workers, at least 200 each from other corporations in the state, to Chennai for cleaning and relief work. The electricity department brought in 2,000 workers, with over 10,000 electric poles and at least 100 transformers fully damaged. Besides, we had ordered around 50 transformers from Karnataka as some 50 more were already in stock,” said a senior state government official.

“We cleared all the highways connecting Chennai before the first night itself. Major routes were diverted,” said Tamil Nadu DGP T K Rajendran, who was present on the ground. It also helped that state police had already procured key relief equipment, including searchlights and wood-cutters. Personnel from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and state disaster management personnel were deployed much in advance, said officials. And, Army and Navy personnel were on standby following clear communications from the state government.

Quick on their feet

Asked about last year, where a multi-sectoral response system was missing, another minister blamed it on “zero transparency on procedures to follow”. “The system was such that even senior secretaries were reluctant to go beyond their jurisdiction, even in extreme situations. Everyone waited for directions,” said the minister.

This time, government officials said, Education Minister M F Pandiarajan had the absolute authority to take decisions on declaring holidays for educational institutions.

“The direction was clear that we shouldn’t be running for permission for everything from the party bosses and had to ensure that officials got absolute freedom,” said the minister. “From the Chief Minister to ministers, MLAs to government secretaries, local officials to muncipal and electricity workers, everyone was on alert last week… particularly, in areas where the cyclone was expected to make landfall,” he said.

On Monday, Power Minister P Thangamani, who was monitoring the emergency relief work in Chennai, slept overnight at the city corporation office. Municipal Administration Minister S P Velumani visited food distribution centres and temporary shelters. Health Minister C Vijayabaskar was seen on the streets, directing relief work. Chief Minister O Panneerselvam also visited at least a dozen affected locations and interacted with people.”Officials were not confused about their duties or worried about managing the flow of information. There were no territorial issues. There was absolute freedom to respond to the calamity,” said another senior government secretary, who attended over 10 disaster-response meetings with Panneerselvam and other ministers from last Sunday till Thursday.

Kept the lines open

Last year, the then Chief Secretary Gnanadesikan, Health Secretary J Radhakrishnan and senior officials were reluctant to engage with the media to share basic information or even reveal the death toll. Last week, a number of IAS officers were providing realtime information from the ground. In fact, Radhakrishnan and Revenue Secretary Gopal were seen briefing media and the public multiple times a day, apart from briefings initiated by top government secretaries.

Besides, the regional meteorological department chief, Narayanan, said that a WhatsApp group of officials was active throughout the crisis hours, assessing and sharing details of relief work.

Many anxious residents were forced to leave their houses, with the roads being inundated all through the day and night. Around 30 girls aged between four and 18, all residents of the Prasanna Jyothi Ashram, were forced to evacuate.



To make matters worse, the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is yet to find a way to drain the stagnant water.



“The lake, spread across 84 acres, has two waste weirs, but only one is functional. The civic agencies are scared of opening the second waste weir as it leads to the swollen Kodichikkanahalli lake, which has wreaked havoc in parts of BTM Layout and surrounding areas,” a resident said.



The affected areas include Ashwath Narayana and Sharadha Layouts. Besides the disconnection of power supply, residents also have to worry about snakes and a possible epidemic outbreak.



“We have been neglected by the civic authorities. The BBMP officials have done nothing to drain the water for the last three days. The toilets are overflowing and sewage water has entered into the sumps. We do not even have clean drinking water,” said Veena Mahesh, a resident of Ashwath Narayana Layout.



With the water level showing no signs of receding, many are considering shifting to other localities. “I am scared of the building’s foundation being weakened. Nearly 100 houses in and around the locality have been affected by the floods. There cannot be a free flow of water unless the BBMP desilts and de-weeds the drains,” said Yeshwanth M, another resident from the same area.



These views were echoed by another resident, Deepa N B. “The entire area is covered with water. We have many children in the area.



It is a challenge to relocate, especially shift senior citizens. There is no means of transport too,” Deepa expressed.

The sudden downpour during the evening rush hour caused waterlogging and long traffic jams with commuters getting stuck for hours at different places in Chandigarh and Panchkula, but also brought some welcome relief from the humid weather.

Panchkula, which was billed just a few days ago as 60 per monsoon deficient, got nearly 40 per cent of its total rainfall in all of July in just about 60 minutes. Weather officials said they were examining to see if it was a record.

“A cloud that from Solan and Nahan side that came towards Panchkula got vertical growth. It lifted moisture on the way due to which vertical growth occurred resulting in 47 mm rain in a short span. In dry and subdued conditions such weather occurs. We are checking the duration in which this rainfall occurred on the radar and will be able to confirm whether it is a record,” said Meteorological Department Director Surinder Paul.

The Meteorological Department has predicted cloudy skies for Friday as well and possibility of rain. The maximum humidity recorded Thursday was 87 percent. The maximum temperature was 37 degrees and the minimum 27 degrees, four degrees above normal.

Traffic jams were experienced along Madhya Marg, especially near Sector 26, Sector 29-31 stretch, and roads leading to Panchkula. In Panchkula, the situation was worst along the one kilometre stretch from the Mansa Devi Complex T-point to the Sector 6-7 roundabout. Dozens of cars broke down on the waterlogged roads which added to the chaos. People could be seen wading in the water and pushing their cars. For as long as two hours, people were stuck at this stretch, but the Panchkula police were nowhere to be seen.

Roads were overflowing with water as the stormwater drainage system could not manage the water, despite the civic body’s tall claims. In Panchkula, waterlogging was witnessed at Sector 8, 9,10, 11, 18,19, Fatehpur village and Mansa Devi Complex. However, Mohali remained free of traffic jams.

“I don’t understand why there is no police official to man the traffic? I have to rush to see my daughter who is unwell,” said Aarushi Khullar, a resident of Sector 2, Panchkula.

Panchkula Mayor Upinder Kaur Ahluwala said that in May itself, she had written a letter to all the departments concerned to clear the gullies but to no avail.

“They don’t want to work. I had written to them in May itself but they did not do anything. They don’t have proper pipelines and the residents suffer as a result. I will write a letter to the higher authorities on Monday now,” said Ahluwalia.

N P Sharma, Chief Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Chandigarh, said that the size of the stormwater drainage pipes were around half-inch. “In case of heavy rainfall, it takes very little time for the water to drain out,” he said.

There were power outage across the city after the rainfall, but in Sector 7 Panchkula, the residents had to go without power for hours after a tree fell on electricity wires and brought down several poles. The residence of former Haryana Chief Minister Bhajan Lal is in the area. The residents rued that it highlighted the poor management in Panchkula.

One of the residents, Rajnish, said, “The electricity poles in the entire row coming crashing down after a tree hit the wires. It could have caused a tragedy and people could have been hurt. No senior official was present at the site. The tree is being chopped off by labourers using axes. The municipal corporation should have mechanical saws which would make the work faster.”",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The bridge was built to extend the airport's second runway so that more flights could be handled. But despite warnings, the likelihood of an adverse impact on areas like Manapakkam was not taken into consideration before construction, the residents charged.A senior official of the Public Works Department (PWD) said, ""We have surveyed the area near the bridge and are in the process of studying its impact on the water flow after the airport and its neighbourhood were inundated when water was released from Chembarambakkam reservoir in the first week of December last year.""Houses in Manapakkam were submerged during the flood as the water level rose to more than five feet.

382,1460,bangalore,2016,https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/mar/09/kolkata-wetlands-india-miracle-environmentalist-flood-defence,9 Mar 2016,The miracle of Kolkata's wetlands – and one man's struggle to save them,"The trees on the streets of Kolkata in January are dusty, like neglected pot plants. At traffic lights, salesmen offer feather dusters for drivers to wipe their grimy cars. Shrubs are planted on the central reservation of the city’s new flyovers, surrounded by the implausible boasts on signs proclaiming a “clean and green” city. But the most frequently recurring poster, above almost every street corner, appeals for investors to “Come to Bengal – Ride the Growth”.

Kolkata, a famously cultured city of 14.5 million people – once the second city of the British empire after London – is keen to catch up with Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore, the dynamic and rapidly modernising megacities of the fastest growing major economy in the world.

Kolkata is also a low-lying city, on average it is barely five metres above sea level, served by two major rivers and surrounded by waterways. Its unique wetlands to the east are under pressure from developers like never before, just when they might prove most useful. Hundreds of buildings, from luxury apartments to colleges to more modest homes, are going up in an area which is supposedly protected from development by law.

Faced by the rising sea levels and increased storminess brought on by climate change, cities all over the world – a World Bank study named Guangzhou, Miami, New York, New Orleans and Mumbai at risk of most costly damage – are having to rethink their relationship with flood defences, both natural and artificial. According to the World Bank, an optimistic forecast of just 20cm of sea level rise by 2050 would still make Kolkata the third most exposed city in the world to the risk of flooding.

Such projections no longer belong to a distant future. In November last year, similarly low-lying Chennai experienced cataclysmic floods, which caused the displacement of 1.8 million people. Twenty years ago, Chennai had 650 wetlands in and around the city. Today it has 27. Chennai’s super-powered growth came at the expense of the marshes that could act as an effective natural flood defence; without them, flood water had nowhere to go except cascade into smart new homes.

From the air, Kolkata’s tower blocks are golden in the hazy, smoggy sunshine. To the east, right up against the city sparkles a vast expanse of water: a patchwork of tiny flooded fields bordered by green embankments, ponds, channels and much larger lakes. Take the road to the East Kolkata Wetlands and you’re met by a stream of motorbikes towing two-wheeled trailers, piled high with vegetables and fat silvery carp and tilapia being lugged from the wetlands to city markets.

These waterways are a part-natural, part-human phenomenon and their miraculous character is explained by Dhrubajyoti Ghosh, a slight, bespectacled engineer-turned-ecologist-turned-anthropologist, who speaks English extremely softly and very correctly. Ghosh was asked in 1981 to conduct an investigation into what happened to Kolkata’s wastewater. The city produced a lot of sewage, didn’t have a treatment plant, but didn’t seem to have a pollution problem, either. The waste just sort of disappeared.

Sewage-grown fish may sound gross but Ghosh and others have found them to be safe

“The only English word that suits is serendipity,” says Ghosh, who is now 69, as we stand beside one of its ponds, with the ruins of what resembles a temple behind us. As a young man, he made the short commute from Kolkata to examine these lakes almost every day. He found that the pond water “was beautiful”. To diagnose what was occurring didn’t really require a degree in biology, he says, it was simply common sense. Wastewater is 95% water and 5% problem – bacteria.

Carried by long channels towards the ponds, effluent was broken down by UV rays from the sun. (Ironically, Kolkata’s middle classes pay for UV treatment of their tap water to make it drinkable.) This nutrient-rich water is channelled into ponds where algae and fish thrive. Sewage-grown fish may sound gross but Ghosh and others have found them to be safe; Kolkata’s sewage contains very low levels of heavy metals.

I interrupt to ask about the ruined building behind us. Ghosh smiles slowly. He told local people to leave it standing as an important monument. It is the remains of a conventional sewage treatment plant built by the British, which didn’t work. In tropical countries, expensive water treatment plants struggle to banish bacteria. But Kolkata’s waterways clean its wastewater in less than 20 days. In a conventional water treatment works, thriving algae might become a problem. Here, the algae is removed by fishermen and fed to the fish that grow quickly in these nutrient-rich ponds. “An abundant population of fish growing on nothing,” says Ghosh. “You don’t need fish food.”

The wetlands serve two functions that at first glance seem contradictory: they are the city’s free sewage works and they are also a fertile aquatic market garden. As well as fish, wastewater is used in paddy fields and vegetables are grown on the verdant banks and on a long, low hill created by Kolkata’s organic waste. This recycling makes Kolkata the cheapest major city in India. You can enjoy a traditional breakfast for 30p, a third of the price of Delhi.

Kolkata’s waterways clean its wastewater in less than 20 days

The wetlands produce 10,000 tonnes of fish each year and the wetland “garbage farms” provide 40 to 50% of the green vegetables available on the Kolkata’s markets. This food is fresh and cheap because there are almost no transport costs when it is brought by bicycle from these gardens so close to the centre. “I describe this as an ecologically subsidised city,” says Ghosh. “If you lose these wetlands, you lose this subsidy but Calcuttans are not interested to know why they are the cheapest city.”

Kolkata’s wetlands evolved over several human lifetimes and no public official – until Ghosh came along – grasped how it all functioned. But the fishermen knew. The wetlands were originally low-lying salt marshes and silted up rivers. During the days of the British empire, a Bengali engineer educated in Glasgow designed and built gently graded channels that transferred Kolkata’s wastewater from city to wetlands and on to the Bay of Bengal. In the early decades of the 20th century, local fishermen began using this wastewater to farm fish. Ponds were also converted into paddy fields to grow rice. Some 30,000 people make a living from the wetlands. Ghosh’s findings sound uncontroversial but they were not immediately recognised by the authorities. “Everybody challenged it for at least 10 years,” he says, “but it’s such a simple principle that it cannot be challenged.”

Real estate in waiting

We walk into the wetlands on a grassy bank that contains a straight channel of water from the city. It is dark matte grey in colour and flows surprisingly quickly. I catch a whiff rather like an urban drain in high summer, a slight tang of sewage. “But it’s not much, is it?” says Ghosh, almost offended at the suggestion that these beautiful wetlands, full of palms, brilliant-white egrets and peacefully industrious human activity, might smell ever so slightly fruity.

After establishing the utility of the wetlands in the 1980s, Ghosh’s next task was to define their area. He drew up a map of these ponds and waterways. Around half the wetlands were taken and their ponds filled in so that a smart new suburb, Salt Lake City, could be built. Ghosh did not quibble. “There is no need to get emotional. The city had to grow. It was organised urbanisation. What’s happening now is not an organised urbanisation.”

As Salt Lake City was built, Ghosh persuaded West Bengal’s then chief minister to accompany him on a trip to the remaining wetlands. He sought to demonstrate the effectiveness of Kolkata’s free filtration system to the politician. “I took a glass of water from the pond and I drank it. The chief minister was worried. I told him I do not have a lavatory as a backup,” says Ghosh drily. Of course he didn’t need one. The water was clean. This natural sewer and food bank is “unique in the whole world”, says Ghosh, “and yet we are ready to forget about it.”

In the early 1990s, West Bengal’s government wanted to build a towering world trade centre in the wetlands. Ghosh advised the opposition led by an NGO with the excellent acronym PUBLIC (People United for Better Living in Calcutta). After a judge visited the wetlands, Kolkata’s high court delivered the verdict in 1992 that Ghosh had been hoping for: the wetlands would be preserved for fishing and farming. It was the first major legal battle in India whereby the environment emerged victorious.

They had no idea that a huge number of people depended on wetlands for their livelihoods. Dhrubajyoti Ghosh

Ghosh was not finished, however. He was not confident that West Bengal’s state government would ever conscientiously protect the wetlands. So he sought a higher authority. Like zoologist Jane Goodall and Sir David Attenborough, Ghosh has been given a Global 500 Award, recognition from the UN for environmental achievement. This at least obliges politicians to acknowledge his letters even if, as he quietly points out, they then throw them in the bin.

Ghosh lobbied international conservationists, including officials working for the Ramsar Convention, which designates globally important wetlands. Ramsar understood wetlands to be places where you could watch birds. “Nothing wrong with that but it was incomplete,” says Ghosh. “They had no idea that a huge number of people depended on wetlands for their livelihoods. This was an unknown type of wetland.”

It took a long time to gain international recognition for Kolkata’s wetlands but they were finally given Ramsar status in 2002. It was the highpoint of Ghosh’s career – and he felt it came to mean nothing. Ghosh discovered that the Ramsar status gave no additional legal protection. Ramsar demands that the local government draws up a management plan for every wetlands area within six months of its designation; 14 years on, there is still no management plan for Kolkata’s wetlands.

Worse, says Ghosh, the West Bengal government displays no desire to enforce the 1992 high court ruling. Illegal developments are going up all over the wetlands, and staying up. “People have more confidence in a lack of law than in the law itself,” Ghosh says. And why is the government silent? “They also understand what real estate means to their election campaign. Wetlands are real estate in waiting.”

Today, a banner sign above the road to the wetlands tells travellers that the mangrove forests of Sundarbans, a Unesco World Heritage Site, are just 80km away. There are no signs announcing the East Kolkata Wetlands. They are, literally, off the map.

Your home in the clouds

Stalking the highway along the eastern edge of Kolkata are the new apartment blocks of Rajahat, a gleaming suburb built on soil excavated from the wetlands. “Atmosphere. Your home in the clouds,” boasts one billboard. Electronic advertisements for Vodafone blurt from tower block rooftops. Closer to the smartly dressed office workers sat in motionless rush hour cars are fly-posters for “scholarship tests” and mock exams to help you “learn, compete, succeed”.

Beside these aspirational invitations to personal growth are more appeals from West Bengal’s chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, to “Come to Bengal – Ride the Growth.” Banerjee, who faces an election this spring, came to power in 2011 as a populist, pro-market alternative to Bengal’s long-ruling Communist party. She is desperate to grow Kolkata, and declares she will turn the city into the London of India; by the airport road stands a replica of Big Ben, made from fibre-reinforced polymer, one-third of the size of the original.

Beyond the line of apartments marching out into the wetlands at Rajahat is a shanty town and then Aquatica – “a complete family water theme park and resort”. A dolphin leaping through a rubber ring is painted on its white gates. Beside these is a roadside shack where I drink tiny cups of salty tea with a middle-aged couple, Kartick Chandra Mandal and Shibani Mandal.

Kartick is a fisherman-turned-teacher; Shibani still works in the local fishing industry, packing fish. “The biggest threat to fishing is development,” says Kartick. The water park before us and the low-rise apartment block behind us, fortified with rolls of barbed wire on its walls, were both developments that should not have been permitted. According to Kartick and Shibani, they were paddy fields until a local politician redrew the map – an administrative sleight of hand to move this wetland area into a different parish, which was classified as outside the wetlands and therefore able to be built on.

Such ploys are occurring all over the wetlands, their long-term value trumped by their short-term price as prime real estate. Fishing families allege that ponds are being deliberately sabotaged, with channels blocked up, to force them to abandon their livelihoods. “Land sharks” working for developers use persuasion or intimidation to buy cheap wetland plots and build tower blocks on top. In some cases, the authorities themselves flout their own laws and build small corrugated dwellings on the wetlands for people cleared from the last slums in central Kolkata.

On the rare occasion that the struggle for the wetlands makes the news, its defence is portrayed as elitist. Kolkata’s mayor has declared that the conservation of the wetlands “means little to the common man”. Banerjee, a self-styled champion of the poor, last year stated her intent to find an amnesty for 25,000 illegal buildings within the wetlands area.

Education is usually trumpeted as a saviour of the environment; here, it seems to be the opposite. I wonder if the wetlands could be saved through education, but Ghosh says that no schools bring pupils on trips to the wetlands and no biology lessons are dedicated to understanding this marvellously useful system. Kartick, a teacher, believes that the younger generation are “not as interested or inspired” as his own in preserving the wetlands. “Let there be more ‘dropouts’” he says. “Those who are educated are trying to destroy them.”

Ghosh has dedicated his whole professional life to the wetlands. His wife is dead and his one child lives in Hong Kong, working in high finance. “I worked so hard for recognition from Ramsar and I have got no result. I have lost my life doing this.” It sounds despairing but Ghosh continues to fight for the wetlands. These days, he is less an environmental engineer and more an anthropologist, seeking to describe the unique lives and livelihoods of its residents. If the wetlands can be seen as “heritage”, he thinks, people might cherish them more.

There is one final hope. Aside from providing heritage, a free sewage system and an aquatic market garden, the wetlands’ other urban function – flood defence – is arguably the most indispensable. Chennai’s experience is a powerful lesson. Ghosh realises that it is myopic for his city to mimic Chennai and jeopardise its future by exploiting its wetlands for short-term profit. If Kolkata’s politicians and policymakers can be persuaded too, this famously thoughtful city might avoid the fraught path taken by so many other urban powerhouses who fail to grasp that the sea is always more unstoppable than their own development.

They have also proposed to pump out water from the stream into the Krishna in case of a heavy flood discharge.The APCRDA will submit the latest proposal to National Green Tribunal (NGT), which is hearing a batch of petitions related to the capital city. Guntur Channel supplies water to Guntur city and provides irrigation to about 23,000 acres in the district. The popular belief is that Guntur Channel draws water from the Prakasam barrage directly. In reality, Kondaveeti Vagu is the connecting link between Krishna river and Guntur Channel. There was no problem with the stream before the construction of the barrage. It began flooding the region after the barrage was constructed and was linked to Guntur Channel. The backwaters of Kondaveeti Vagu inundates large tracts of land. Even 20 mm rainfall leads to flooding.On average 750 cusecs of water flows into Guntur Channel from Vagu daily. The APCRDA has proposed a new sluice at Prakasam barrage to delink the channel from Vagu. The project may not cost more than Rs 50 lakh.Construction of a sluice will limit inundation to just 3,000 acres. Officials have also proposed diversion of flood water from Vagu to Krishna's western main canal. ""In case of extreme floods both in the river and Vagu, flood water from the stream can be pumped into the barrage,"" said ISN Raju, a member of the expert committee on Kondaveeti Vagu.APCRDA will argue before the NGT that Kondaveeti Vagu per se is not a problem and floods can be controlled by de-linking it from the Guntur Channel. The master plan for the capital city could not be completed with the flood management plan for Kondaveeti Vagu pending.

Today, the wetlands have been encroached upon by residences, infrastructure projects, public and private institutions and even landfills, making the city vulnerable to flooding.Narayanapuram Lake, part of the larger Pallikaranai wetland ecosystem, was not only a source of fresh water but was also of cultural significance to the local population, according to a study by Chennai-based biodiversity research organisation CareEarth.The lake covered 64 acres, said CareEarth co-founder Jayashree Vencatesan, and more than 10 acres was filled to build the road and other structures. The Thoraippakkam-Pallavaram Radial Road was the first of these encroachments on the water body, she said.The new road led to the appearance of several residential colonies, which flood unfailingly every monsoon. One section of the lake is used as washing area for trucks and clothes and the other half is covered with water hyacinth, an invasive alien species.Narayanapuram Lake is part of a cascade of wetlands, which were formed by a stream. This stream, which drained from west to east, joined join a larger stream that drained from Ottiyambakkam into Pallikaranai marsh. Several water bodies in Pallikaranai village were once connected to Narayanapuram through a larger stream which flowed from south-west to north.CareEarth's GIS analyst S Vignesh said these cascades demonstrated the significance of the wetland for flood mitigation for a large area encompassing the Radial Road, Pallikaranai village and the emerging habitations on the southern periphery of the road. So it is no surprise that Narayanapuram Lake was the first to breach during the floods last December, he said.The plants of the habitat, however, indicate the possibility of reversing some of the damage. Within the immediate periphery of the wetland, 105 species of plants were recorded recently, which indicates that the area is predominantly wet, he said. The presence of typical wetland plants like ottelia, nymphaea, aponogeton, eleocharis and other sedges on what is left of the wetland as well as in the lanes of the area reiterate this notion.

It took away with it several thousand lives and rendered a larger number homeless. The magnitude of the tragedy, to this day popularly known as tughyani, deluge or flooding, was such that it made the then ruler of Hyderabad State, Mir Mahboob Ali Khan , mute with despair. And at a time when as dozens of neighbourhoods were washed away, it was a tamarind tree along the banks of the raging Musi that saves as many as 150.But the city administration has done little to preserve it.On the northern banks of the river Musi, a stones throw from another prominent landmark, the Osmania General Hospital, the tamarind tree and its surroundings are a shambles.Noted heritage activist Sajjad Shahid, who has been associated with the Centre for Deccan Studies, points out: ""It was in 2008, which marked the centenary of the floods, that several non-governmental organisations, activists and academicians, among others went to the tree and paid homage to those who died in the floods."" While some sources put the death toll at around 15,000, others peg it at around two lakh, he said. ""The two lakh figure could be an exaggeration"", he added.The activists once again made their way to the tree in 2014. Only this time, they were accompanied by the then Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation commissioner Somesh Kumar who announced that the Afzal Park, where the 300-year old tree stands, would be given a new lease of life. However, little has changed. The area is dense with foliage and is also said to invite anti-social elements.""These days, those saving the life of a dog are celebrated. This unique tree saved lives of those who clung on to it - irrespective of religion or race. This is its symbolism. We do not have the decency to save or create a park around it,"" he said.There are several inscriptions dotted across the city which serve as grim reminders of the tughyani. A trip to the Old City and a closer look at the older structures along the margins of its roads and lanes are sure to reveal these ""markers"".One such inscription can be seen on the northern wall of Masjid-e-Barq Gunj, a mosque of the Qutub Shahi area, near Petla Burj Maternity Hospital . ""H.F.L 28th SEP. 1908"", the inscription reads.According to urban geographer Anant Maringanti, who is the director of Hyderabad Urban Lab, the inscription ""H.F.L"" is an abbreviation for high flood marker which indicates the dangerous levels flood waters had reached in 1908 and the date is when the tragedy struck.""The flood markers were put up there to tell us that a mistake was made and that we had better be prepared. Later, the Nizam brought in M Visvesvaraya who played a key role in conceptualising and getting the water bodies in Gandipet done.

But it is difficult to catch hold of them as they keep changing places along with their cane baskets, sources said.“I was surprised to discover that the fresh green ponk I got for Rs 500 per kg turned out to be chewy and utterly tasteless.

Flood affected regions in the country, especially Assam, Meghalaya and adjoining areas, can heave a sigh of relief — for now at least. With rainfall activity over these areas having gone down over the last couple of days, water levels in most of the flooded rivers is receding fast.

At 11 pm on Monday, real-time data from the Central Water Commission (CWC) were showing waters above the danger level at only 20 flood monitoring stations. And only two of them, Kursela in Katihar district of Bihar and Gunupur is Rayagada, Odisha, were showing an actual rising trend.

The CWC monitor, a detailed data sheet with current and historical numbers (See 7 pm snapshot alongside) is updated constantly on the commission’s web site. As of Monday evening, it had data for only “Moderate Flood Situation Report” — no monitored site was recording the more dangerous “High Flood Situation Report” or “Unprecedented Flood Situation Report”.

Among the major rivers, the Ganga was flowing slightly above the danger mark at Kahalgaon in Bihar’s Bhagalpur district earlier on Monday evening, and was at the time seen as going up. However, water levels at all other stations were either steady or falling, according to data from the CWC. At all these stations, the water levels were comfortably lower than the next danger mark — the 0.5 m line below the High Flood Level (technically referred to as ‘HFL –0.5’).

At 11 pm, 8 of the 20 above- danger-mark monitoring stations were in Bihar, 6 in Uttar Pradesh, 3 in Assam, and 1 each in West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand.

The floods in these areas were the result of heavy rainfall in the second half of July. Assam and Bihar were the worst affected. Nearly 17 lakh people in 22 (of 35) districts of Assam and almost 2.5 million people in Bihar were affected, according to the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), which has deployed 80 teams of 45 personnel each in these areas.

The East and Northeast — eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, Sikkim, and the entire Northeastern region — had a late beginning to the monsoon this year. When the rest of the country, mainly central India, was getting heavy rainfall at the end of June and first half of July, these areas had been almost dry.

But when monsoon subsided in the other regions, it began to pour in the East and Northeast. In the week between July 21 and July 27, Arunachal Pradesh received rainfall that was 92% more than normal, Assam had 22% above normal, and Meghalaya had 4% more. During the same time, Sikkim had 40% above normal rainfall, and West Bengal had 66% more. Floods resulted in several deaths and affected at least 5 million people in all.

Bihar and Uttar Pradesh actually had below normal rainfall in this week, but they had received heavy rains in the previous week.

Despite the rains that caused flooding, each of these states, barring Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, is deficient as far as rainfall in this entire season, beginning June 1, is concerned. East and Northeast India received 28% less rainfall in June, and 2% less in July. Together, it has 13% deficiency so far in this monsoon season.

The phase of heavy rainfall is over in these areas, and the flood situation is likely to improve in the next few days. On Sunday and Monday, very little rain fell in these states. The latest forecast from the Meteorological department shows little rainfall over the next five days as well. Fresh rounds of rainfall in the East and Northeast is predicted only after August 7.

“For the last two days, our teams are reporting a consistent improvement in the situation, both in Assam and in Bihar. At most places, water has been receding. Similar situation prevails in West Bengal and UP as well. We expect the water to drain out from most places over the next two to three days. However, our teams would remain deployed in the flood-prone areas for some more time,” O P Singh, director general, NDRF, said.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

But now, three years later, the village has come back to life through the efforts of a woman who has been awarded the moniker -- Mushroom Lady of Uttarakhand.Twenty-six-year-old Divya Rawat, who has popularised the cultivation of the edible fungus in many areas of the state, has recently set up a facility in Kaviltha which will help villagers cultivate the highly priced oyster mushrooms.On the rationale behind cultivation of this particular variety of mushroom, Rawat said that oyster mushrooms can be comfortably grown in the temperatures prevalent at the altitude in which Kaviltha is situated (around 6,000 feet). “The cultivation of the oyster mushroom can be done throughout the year enabling villagers to have a constant source of livelihood. Also, these mushrooms are a rich source of protein and vitamin D3 and can be consumed by the villagers as well for their nutritional requirements,” she told TOI.Rawat, who has a master’s degree in social work, says that she was driven to do something for the people of the hills who are forced to migrate due to lack of opportunities and inadequate facilities in their villages. When the 2013 Kedarnath tragedy struck, the alumnus of Army School in Dehradun, who was in her native village Kotkandara in Chamoli district at that time, resolved to do “something which would ease the pain and suffering that people of the region had to endure.”This resolve found fruition with the opening of the mushroom unit in the village with the help of the Piramal Foundation which has been working for the rehabilitation of disaster-hit villages. Expressing happiness over the source of livelihood that would now be made available in their village, Sangeeta Devi, one of the ten women who were trained by Rawat, told TOI, ""This young girl has given us a ray of hope. We want to live here in our village rather than being tagged as refugees in other towns. We are ready for any amount of hard work and will also teach the art of mushrooms to our daughters so that they can go out and help others too.""Meanwhile, Rawat, who started her mushroom venture with an initial investment of Rs 3 lakh a little over two years ago, is now registering a turnover of Rs 30 lakh annually. She says she has a target to set up 50 units across Uttarakhand this year and provide sustainable livelihood to more than 2000 people directly or indirectly. “I feel migration due to natural calamity is the biggest crisis that can happen to any person. That is why I will strive to do whatever I can to help stem the tide of migration.”For centuries, scholars have speculated that Kalidasa may have lived near the Himalayas, in the vicinity of Ujjain, and in Kalinga. This hypothesis is based on Kalidasa's detailed description of the Himalayas in his Kumarasambhava, the display of his love for Ujjain in Meghaduta, and his highly eulogistic descriptions of Kalingan emperor Hemangada in Raghuvaṃsha (sixth sarga).",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown

Among the worst affected were Jamshedpur and Ramgarh districts, although heavy rain was recorded in almost all areas of the state. According to the Indian Meteorological Department’s Ranchi office, Jamshedpur received the heaviest rainfall of 270 mm in the last 24 hours. Almost all the areas in the Central, South and North-West Jharkhand received at least 80 mm or more rain.

The weather forecast for Friday indicates that some places in South, Central and North-West Jharkhand may witness heavy rainfall.

With rainfall starting late Wednesday evening and continuing through the night, Subarnarekha and Kharkai Rivers in Jamshedpur were flowing above the danger mark. While Subarnarekha flowed at around 2.5 metres above the danger mark (121.50 metres), Kharkai too was flowing at around 4.5 metres above the danger mark (129 metres).

The flooding in these two rivers has been caused due to release of water from Chandil dam (located in neighbouring Seraikela Khrasawan district), where officials opened eight of the 13 gates following consistent rain since the last three days.

“The low lying localities in areas like Mango, Kadma, Sonari and Bagbera have been worst affected. Water has entered houses in some of the colonies like Shastri Nagar and Bagbera. However, one of the gates of the Chandil dam has been closed, indicating that the situation is easing out,” said an official from the district administration of Jamshedpur.

At least 26 big and small relief camps for the affected residents have been set up in these areas. “Deputy Commissioner, along with Sub-Divisional Officers are leading and monitoring the relief work. The situation is under control,” said the official.

However, heavy rains and subsequent flooding over the past two months caused havoc on the region and has ruined paddy crop over 10,000 hectares in the district.The district faced major floods during the first week of July and August, when most farmers had completed their cultivation. The farms remained under water for more than a week period, which has affected the growth of plants. The damage assessment has already begun and would reveal the actual extent of damage.The damage assessment is done by officials from district agriculture department, talathis and senior revenue officers. The district agriculture department records stated that paddy cultivation in the district has been on 1,08,520 hectares, but the incessant showers in the first week of July and August raised the river water level and submerged adjoining areas.Five tehsils - Karvir, Panhala, Gaganbavda, Radhanagari and Shahuwadi - along with some parts of Chandgad and Ajara tehsils are known for paddy cultivation. These areas were flooded and the water spread across the river banks.Officials from district agriculture department pointed out that flood water was spread for more than five days in these tehsils and all the saplings planted a fortnight before were submerged. The saplings did not get required sunlight for a long time and excess exposure to the water caused major damage.The high intensity of the showers during the current monsoon season meant that the district received 47% of its average rainfall for August in just three days. With such heavy downpour, the water levels of most rivers went up drastically and paddy fields got submerged.Suresh Magdum, deputy director of district agriculture department, said, ""Many farmers took up paddy cultivation near the river despite knowing that these areas get affected during heavy rain. Unfortunately, now, there is no mechanism to help improve the condition of the affected paddy fields.

CHENNAI: Crippling floods in the city have caused huge losses to the IT industry. IT insiders have pegged the losses at $5-10 million for mid-size firms and $40-50 million for large companies. Cognizant TCS and other IT firms have been organizing buses every hour to send employees to Bangalore. Around 2000 employees of each of these companies have already left to work out of Bangalore. HR departments of IT companies are trying to contact each and every employee in Chennai to check their status. Many employees are still stranded in their homes.Apart from IT sector, automobile industry chamber have estimated the possible losses to be around Rs 15,000 crore. According to Assocham, small and medium enterprises, engineering, textiles and tourism sectors have also been badly hit by the flooding.Automakers like Hyundai, Renault-Nissan, Ashok Leyland and Royal Enfield remained closed on Thursday and industry sources said things are likely to remain ""at a standstill mode"" till Saturday. What's more Chennai is also a major auto parts hub. So, the floods could hobble production in automobile factories across the country, said industry experts. The seriousness of the situation can be gauged by the fact that top executives, like the CEO of Ashok Leyland, had to be evacuated and several companies said they were working to help out executives stuck in rain-ravaged areas.As Chennai continued to fight back unprecedented rain and floods, the death toll climbed to 450 since the onset of monsoon in October-end in the city and neighbouring districts. With the forecast of intermittent rain, sometimes heavy, for Chennai and heavy rain in the delta districts of Tamil Nadu, Army and NDRF teams speeded up rescue and relief operations.On day four of the latest round of rain onslaught, anger swept across the city as state departments fumbled with the key task of coordinating among central agencies and NGOs raining relief materials on the state and the virtual crumbling of Chennai's infrastructure.

Across India, city after city has experienced floods, while some others live with the fear of impending disasters. In Mumbai, flooding was caused by wrong developments at the Bandra estuary and negligence along the Mithi river, and in Uttarakhand the disaster was caused by unplanned regional development and the unholy nexus between the land mafia and politicians. The Srinagar valley suffers from an unfortunate geographical disadvantage of being the recipient of water from an enormous watershed above the valley. Water bodies in and around Chennai have been filled up, leaving no space for rainwater to escape when it pours. The deluge and the repercussions have lessons for us for future urban planning.(Reuters File)

Meanwhile, in Delhi, the two governments are merrily building on the city’s flood plains, ignoring the ministry of environment, which is supposed to protect the Delhi Ridge and the Yamuna river. Calcutta’s new growth is entirely in the wetland area, creating multiple infrastructure barriers for surface water flow from the mother city, which in any case has a lower elevation than the Hooghly river. In the past decades, Bangalore’s expansion had been at the cost of an elaborate pond system in the sub-region, a majority of the scattered ponds being built upon by land sharks. The Bruhat Bangalore Development Plan came too late, while artificial land values were created by project-driven infrastructure. In other words, all our metropolitan cities have ignored watershed management and environmental planning to their own peril. This is the juncture in India’s urbanisation when thousands of crores are being poured into the urban centres, coupled with a policy shift in the Environmental Impact Assessment in order to facilitate ‘growth’ for easing the sanction process. All these are also ‘Smart Cities’, ‘AMRUT Cities’ and investment destinations for ambitious metro projects and they are identified as new growth centres of our ‘surging’ economy. In the absence of a proper National Policy for Urbanisation, our metropolitan cities are sitting ducks for all sorts of natural disasters. Spineless local planning organisations, which are subservient to their administrative and political masters, are not willing to put their technical know-how on the table, for fear of punishment transfers and mafia-induced pressures.

The Chennai floods show all these problems can surface in other Indian cities. The geography of South India demonstrates how rivulets, ponds, streams and rivers emanating from the Western Ghats flow towards the East to the Tamil Nadu coast. On the other hand, this coast is also highly vulnerable to storms, depression, tsunami and floods. Chennai is one such area where an enormous watershed finally drains into the sea through its rivers and canals. Has any regional planning exercise recognised this primary natural layer on which urban development forms the secondary layer? No. On the contrary, the watershed on the west of Chennai has been the major venue for industrialisation in corridors going up to Kanchipuram further to the west.

Traditionally the sub-region surrounding Chennai had big and small ponds connected by a working overflow system. The water was allowed to spread into fields and thousands of smaller ponds, with the entire region acting as a ‘sponge’ to absorb the excess water, supporting paddy fields and fish farming. These overflow systems and multiple canals finally find their way to lakes that surround Chennai city. Finally the rivers in Chennai absorb this flow.

In Tamil Nadu’s hurry to industrialise, these watershed areas have been ravaged, with all the major industries, new educational institutions, housing estates, etc. coming up in the past two decades. Thousands of smaller ponds and streams have been filled up, increasing the surface water flow manifold. The major tanks are silted and the amount of water flowing into them has increased. This increased run-off has found its way into the city. Unprecedented rain, induced by climate change, has compounded the problem. While the disaster has been caused by nature, the impact would not have been so severe but for the man-made factors.

The second dimension of Chennai’s flood is another man-made (read planning-made) problem. The Adyar river in the south of the original city had a wide estuary and also a wide flood plain. Many areas south of the river have been marshy and low-lying, serviced by small rivulets and canals. Most submerged areas with floor-high water are on this part of the city, including the IT Park and many multinational corporate headquarters, paralysing business not only in Chennai but across the country and outside.

All the swamps, marsh lands, low-lying areas and streams that these big corporations, middle class housing and slums have built on are inundated as they are at the receiving end of overflowing large regional tanks.

The planned developments along the Adyar river that reduced its capacity as a water outlet are largely government-sponsored as the river bed was in government ownership. In the past three decades, massive housing, planned and unplanned, has cannibalised the river bed, leading to increased flooding, and damaged Chennai’s technology nerve centres and put millions of residents in danger. Chennai is indeed a sordid story of all the ills that plague India’s subservient planning system. Our inability to enforce environmental laws and insatiable greed for land grabbing by both national and international commercial interests are in full play in Chennai. The silver lining, however, is the enormous outflow of altruism, public mindedness and compassion Chennai’s citizens have displayed in the face of this calamity.

Pinning responsibility for faulty planning and political decisions, preparing a scientific watershed management plan, putting in place a disaster warning system, and addressing the immediate problems of the urban poor are the first steps forward. Chennai’s citizens have a resurgent spirit. That indeed is the human capital to build on.

For most people stranded in rain-hit Chennai, taking a flight to neighbouring cities has been a bleak option over the last few days.

This steep hike invoked sharp criticism from passengers and experts who blame the high ticket prices on the lack of clear rules in place for airline companies.""What we need is for the Civil Aviation Authority to regulate pricing and penalise people who fail to do this.

Over 80-85% of the crop loss is in southern Karnataka, surrounding Bengaluru, which is known for growing the Bengaluru Blue grape that bagged the Geographical Indication (GI) status in 2013.The government has turned a blind’s eye to their plight, growers alleged.The worst hit is the seedless variety grown only in Chikkaballapur district; rare varities like Thomson seedless, Krishna seedless and Sharad seedless grapes have been damaged by rain, said Umesh KN, general secretary, Karnataka Grape Growers’ Association.Of the over 800 farmers who committed suicide in 2015 in Karnataka, nine were grape growers, said Umesh. Growers are demanding a survey on grape crop loss at the earliest.KH Mumbaraddy, vice-president, Karnataka Grapes Growers’ Association, said: “In North Karnataka, the hub of grape cultivation, farmers were hit by lack of rain. In the southern part of the state, it was the opposite. Unseasonal rain in the past two months affected the crop in Kolar, Chikkaballapur and Doddaballapur. The drizzle hit ripe fruit and led to their cracking. Loads of fruits harvested ended up becoming manure,” says Mumbaraddy.Crops just about to be harvested were also affected. Besides, those in the flowering condition were affected by fungal diseases such as Anthracnose, Downy Mildews, added Mumbaraddy.Anthracnose or grape rot disease occurs during the rainy, warm and humid climatic conditions. It spreads with black spots on the fruit. The disease is very destructive for vineyards as it reduces the fruit quality/quantity and weakens the vines. Downy mildews is an extremely disease that can result in severe crop loss, with yellow lesions on leaves.Sarvesh Kumar, technical officer, Karnataka Wine Board, said the damage is likely to hit wine production in the state. “This year wine production across Karnataka will be hit by at least 15 per cent,” he said.

From around the industrial hub at Sriperumbudur, some 30 km from Chennai, the signs of rain-ravage start to appear. Small groups of people stand by the roadside, watching the waters surge in drains and lakes. A few anglers are out with fishing rods.

The Tiruvekad bridge on the Poonamallee High Road has taken the brunt of the rain fury — rushing waters swept aside the entire bridge Wednesday, snapping road connectivity between the suburb of Avadi and Chennai city.

While the suburbs of Chennai have not been as badly hit as the central parts, the streets here too have been under water and many people have moved to temporary shelters or to homes of friends and relatives. Large swathes of the road network in the Ambattur suburb of Chennai, including an industrial area, remain submerged.

Wherever one goes, one hears stories of tragedies and miraculous escapes.

During the first deluge in November, several families in the Rampoorna Nagar, in the suburbs near Ambattur, did not move out.

“The water was only knee-high and we thought we would manage. But yesterday, it rose to the neck-level… it was impossible to stay on at home,” Vijaya, who has now abandoned her house and sought shelter two kilometres away at the Venkateswara Matriculation High School, told The Indian Express.

Pushpalatha, who is also from Rampoorna Nagar, has other worries: “Our three dogs are still at home, on the terrace. We send them food from the relief centre.”

Rampoorna Nagar residents say the drain in their locality was blocked to create more land for construction. “We ventured out in heavy rain to try and create an opening for water to drain out. It did not work,” M Nataraj, a mason who has had no work for a month because of the rain, said.

In the suburbs, it is the people who are taking initiatives to ease the flooding. Local councillors help by providing supplies of food and water to families who have decided to stay at home and brave the waters.

The authorities have repeatedly failed to address the issue. Which is why someone has done a Ph.D on the subject!

Mr. Ajay S. Bharadwaj, Deputy Manager, Air Traffic Control, HAL Airport, has come up with a number of suggestions such as: permeable surfaces, artificial recharge trenches and rain water percolation to arrest flooding and waterlogging. He has been awarded a PhD for his thesis at the recentconvocation of Kuvempu University, Shivamogga.

Mr. Bharadwaj has prepared his thesis (titled ‘Bengaluru City Flood Risk Assessment and Management’) using Remote Sensing and GIS under the guidance of Syed Ashfaq Ahmed, Professor of Geology.

Based on the study of the flooding and rainfall in the state over decades, now Mr. Bharadwaj has come up with six permanent solutions linked to the geographical structure of the city.

According to the findings, the city is highly vulnerable to floods during two months of every year i.e. September (average rainfall: 185.99 mm), October (161.66 mm). As per the flood vulnerability classification, the city is vulnerable to floods in May, July and August while April, June and November are classified as less vulnerable months. January, February, March and December are considered non-vulnerable.

Field observations

Mr. Bharadwaj based his findings on field observations. He has now come up with six permanent solutions to end the rain-related floods in the city. One of the major suggestions is permeable surfaces. According to the study findings, one of the major problems in the city is the lack of pervious layers on the ground due to urbanisation.

As a result a lot of water flows on the ground, resulting in increased surface water runoff and higher flooding in the downstream area. Increased permeable areas on the ground will help in addressing this problem to a great extent.

So it is suggested that in places like parking areas, footpaths, walking and jogging lanes, common areas in apartments, companies and other big structures, permeable surfaces should be used instead of complete concrete. The cost involved would not be much compared to conventional concrete surfaces.

The researcher has suggested construction of artificial recharge trenches dug up at storm water drains at regular intervals. This will result in reduction of water levels in the drain. “Hence with little investment we have increased the capacity of the drain, reducing the possibility of drainage overflow. This will reduce the likelihood of flooding in the vicinity of the drain,” he said.

Another suggestion made to civil agencies is construction of artificial recharge trenches, mostly on the roads, covered with metal or similar material, with an allowance for water to pass into the trenches. “Lack of ground water recharge is again addressed through this method,” he said.

Drainage connectivity, rainwater percolation at places where there is shallow water stagnation and providing gaps in the road dividers and footpaths are the three other solutions projected after the scientific study of the rain and flood situation in the city.",solution,Bengaluru Floods,"Bengaluru, India",September,October,Bengaluru city,185.99 mm,,,Flooding and waterlogging,,"['permeable surfaces', 'artificial recharge trenches', 'rainwater percolation', 'drainage connectivity', 'gaps in the road dividers and footpaths']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Story highlights Flooding has killed 272 people in Chennai and surrounding areas, the Indian government says ""The value of Wi-Fi access cannot be underestimated"" for relief efforts, a Chennai resident said

CNN —

Chennai, a city of 4.6 million people on India’s southeast coast, is reeling from some of the heaviest and deadliest rains in decades.

Now, as the floodwaters appear to recede, a massive relief effort is under way with participation by celebrities such as Anil Srinivasan, a classical pianist, and unsung people who just want to help.

“This is something of a megadestruction movie,” said Srinivasan, who lives in the city’s suburb of Nungambakkam. “It’s bizarre and unreal.”

Since October, flooding killed at least 272 people in the region, according to the National Disaster Response Force. About 28,000 people had to be rescued. The flooding knocked out government services, left people stranded and made small boats a commonplace sight in city streets.

The National Crisis Management Committee recently said about 90% of the city has power and buses are running again. Telephone services are not yet fully functional. Train service is spotty but should be back to normal Monday.

The recent weather has been especially grueling lately.

Record-breaking rainfall

In early December, 397 millimeters (nearly 16 inches) of rain fell during a two-day period in Chennai. In November, 1,196 millimeters (47 inches) of rain fell, according to CNN Weather, more than three times the average monthly rainfall of 353 mm (14 inches).

The flooding brought out a helping spirit among residents of Chennai, once known as Madras and India’s fifth-largest city. The restoration of Internet service proved crucial for relief efforts.

“The value of Wi-Fi access cannot be underestimated,” said Sharanya Manivanan of Chennai. “Phone lines were down for days, but those with Internet access were able to make things happen.”

She said people started collecting food and other supplies without knowing how it would be distributed. Others had braved the waters to reach the drop-off points.

“It’s been the people all the way, the average Chennai citizen,” Manivanan said.

Local relief efforts

Tech workers created a crowdsourcing site called www.chennairains.org so people can find sources of food and shelter using their smartphones or computers.

Volunteers such as Balaji Mohan prepared three meals a day for people with no access to clean food or water. Volunteers have cooked, packed and distributed meals to about 7,000 people.

Srinivasan set up a relief center called “Find and Provide” in Gopalapuram in central Chennai where supplies coming in from Bangalore and Mumbai are stored. Private groups have set up hundreds of other similar centers, he said.

Lack of phone and Internet service left relatives outside of India worried about loved ones.

Bala Sundaram of Atlanta said he didn’t have any information about her parents for nearly 72 hours.

“My parents’ neighbor informed my sister in Bangalore that they were doing OK and relieved us of the tension,” Sundaram said. “The people network has been so strong which has helped the city more than anything else.”

Maya Harita, who lives in a suburb outside Atlanta, took to Facebook to get help for her aging parents in Chennai. They had to move upstairs to escape rising water.

“The entire house is wrecked and all their gadgets, equipment, beds, couch, belongings have been destroyed,” Harita said. “All that is left is lots of mud, bugs and snakes.”

Many people took advantage of the Safety Check feature on Facebook, which allowed them to let family members outside the country know they are safe.

Full air service expected to resume

The Indian military rescued thousands of people stranded without power, electricity or water, Srinivasa said. He said private groups such as the Madras Boat Club and the Tamil Nadu Sailing Association have also helped, as well as local fisherman.

The return of full air service to Chennai should make it easier for donations from outside nations to arrive.

Most airlines were expected to resume normal service by Sunday at Chennai International Airport, a huge gateway to the south of India and one of the country’s busiest airports.

Some air service had been canceled flights because of water on the tarmac. Several airlines, including TruJet, SpiceJet, IndiGo and Air India, had diverted flights to Arakkonam, a nearby military airfield 55 miles west of Chennai, according to the State Government of India.

“Drinking water is a megaproblem, then cooked food of any kind, followed by milk and baby food,” Srinivasan said. “Other supplies like blankets and sanitary napkins are also needed.”",flood,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, India",October 2015,December 2015,Chennai and surrounding areas,"397 millimeters (nearly 16 inches) of rain fell during a two-day period in Chennai.

Chennai is the worst-hit city among regions in Tamil Nadu that have received heavy rainfall over the past couple of weeks. With rivers overflowing above limits, water has relentlessly flowed onto streets drowning homes and rendering thousands homeless. But the spirit of the city remains daunted with people helping each other out with food and relief supplies.

While focus has remained on human population, amid all the chaos, it’s hard to imagine what pets and street animals must be going through. Habitual of a flexible environment, the pets are bound to stay indoors and the condition of street animals, especially cats and dogs, is beyond comprehension.

While Friday has brought respite from rain in most areas, the forecast is that there will be more coming – clearly, it is going to be another night of fear for Chennai rain ravaged citizens.

Rains stop in Chennai on Friday, life still difficult

Life for people in Tamil Nadu’s Chennai continue to be difficult though the rains have stopped in the capital.

On Friday, Many areas in Chennai still remain under water and supplies of essentials was difficult, said residents.

“Water logging continues to be there. The only mercy was that there were no rains,” said Viswanath, a resident.

The water flow in Adyar river has come down and the amount of surplus water was released into the river from the Chembarambakkam lake.

The Southern Railways have announced special trains to Tirunelveli, Rameswaram and Howrah from Chennai Beach station.

The power supply was restored in the areas where water has receded, but it was still cut in many other places.

However, communication lines — landline and mobile — continue to disrupt.

In heavily flooded areas like Mudichur and Tambaram, people were looking up to the skies praying for the rains to stop, and for relief materials.

On Wednesday night the steady and continuous rainfall kept people in Tamil Nadu’s capital awake due to concerns over the rising water levels and threat of floods, as is clear from Revathi Vasan’s, resident of west Mambalam, response. “Water came into our apartment and we had to shift to our neighbour’s house on the first floor”. Another family living on the ground floor has also shifted with us, Revathi added. While the residents are living in fear, others heading into Chennai or out of it are facing a set of their own problems. Here aside from the human interest story, we provide an Indian Railways trains cancelled in Chennai list (at bottom of page) as well as Chennai Corporation helplines as on Friday:

“It indeed is alarming,” Chennai-based lawyer Elangovan told IANS, adding that thousands of people were fleeing the city that has been virtually cut off after highways and railway tracks came under water and the airport was ordered shut till December 6.

“The situation in Tamil Nadu is alarming. It is not an exaggeration to say that Chennai has turned into an island,” Rajnath Singh said.

“I have had no drinking water and milk since yesterday (Wednesday),” Harish Rao told IANS from his house in south Chennai.

Surinder Singh, a doctor from Delhi who was stuck in Chennai, told IANS: “It looks like the entire city is under one foot of water. In some places, the water level is more. Flood water has reached almost every locality, including posh areas. Everyone on the streets is barefoot.”

People living at higher levels were opening up their doors to help the strangers.

“The situation was bad and the water level was increasing,” Jenson, resident of Sunambu Kolathur of Kanchipuram district said.

Even market areas like Anna Nagar in the city could not escape from flooding.

In many areas people made shift boats by tying up empty barrels to reach safer places.

The airport was closed Tuesday night, and could not start operations due to water logging in the runway. Several passengers were stranded at the airport, railway and bus stations.

There was no power supply in many areas of Chennai, and mobile phone services were also affected due to the rains.

Meanwhile hotels were getting frantic calls from residents and stranded passengers for accommodation.

“We have couple of families staying with us as they were affected by water logging,” a hotel official said.

“In Villivakkam area the water level was up to my chest. I had to wade through the water for couple of kms and then catch a bus to my work place in Teynampet,” Suresh who works with a private sector company said.

It was raining opportunities for taxi and auto-rickshaw drivers who were charging sky high rates to ply short distances.

A taxi driver charged Rs 4,500 to transport three persons from airport to a hotel in Anna Salai.

Meanwhile, army and navy teams were called to carry out rescue efforts.

Schools and colleges were closed in the city.

The rains stopped on Wednesday morning and provided some respite to the people, but the weather office has forecast heavy rains for next three days.

During the last spell of rains, around 180 people lost their lives in the four district of Chennai, Kanchipuram, Cuddalore and Thiruvallur.

The low-lying area between Velachery and Sholinganalur is especially badly affected. (Source: Reuters)

The catastrophic flooding in Chennai is the result of the heaviest rain in several decades, which forced authorities to release a massive 30,000 cusecs from the Chembarambakkam reservoir into the Adyar river over two days, causing it to flood its banks and submerge neighbourhoods on both sides. It did not help that the Adyar’s stream is not very deep or wide, and its banks have been heavily encroached upon over the years.

Similar flooding triggers were in action at Poondi and Puzhal reservoirs, and the Cooum river that winds its way through the city.

While Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa said, during the earlier phase of heavy rain last month, that damage during the monsoon was “inevitable”, the fact remains that the mindless development of Chennai over the last two decades — the filling up of lowlands and choking of stormwater drains and other exits for water — has played a major part in the escalation of the crisis.

On the evidence of what is currently unfolding in Chennai, city authorities would appear to have the abandoned the concept of stormwater drains — the fundamental instrument of flood-fighting — altogether over the years. Experts at Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) pointed out that the key parameter of rain intensity measure — which ought to be at least 1 inch per hour — has been ignored while planning multicrore drainage projects.

While stormwater drains are supposed to be planned on the basis of detailed topographical data, their linkage with water bodies, construction along their course, and the design of roads have rarely been seen as part of a whole. As a result, drains constructed over the past decade have repeatedly proved inefficacious — and showed up problems of poor urban planning nearly every monsoon.

Planning officials said contractors are rarely briefed on the topography or the flood character of sites. A top civic official said even the water log data of the last 10 years are often not considered as officials “hurry to complete works” before the allocated funds lapse. A former CMDA planner said mandatory standards based on data on sea level and water flows are not followed, resulting in situations like Koyambedu, the neighbourhood that saw expensive stormwater drain projects, but has still gone under.

Across Chennai, illegal construction has been making neighbourhoods unrecognisable — what may have been a tank, lake, canal or river 20 years ago, is today the site of multistorey residential and industrial structures. There are over 1.5 lakh illegal structures in the city, according to a report submitted by CMDA to the Madras High Court. Despite several HC orders ordering their demolition, the buildings stand — often after appeals to the Supreme Court, and due to the inefficiency of the CMDA’s legal wing. Hundreds of stay orders against demolition orders have been obtained by both business houses and individuals.

As the illegal structures sprouted in the city and suburbs, over 300 water bodies disappeared. The irreversible destruction of the city’s natural water paths can be seen in the flooding in Mudichur, Velachery, and several other areas that have come up on wetlands or river basins.

After a major flood in 2005, Chennai had commissioned a project to prepare laser terrain maps, scanning the entire city from a helicopter, instead of depending on topographic maps. But this project remains unimplemented — just like the early warning system that was prepared by the Department of Remote Sensing at Anna University to understand the run-off pattern of rainwater.

El Niño to blame, other factors too

An exceptionally strong El Niño, along with a rare “coincidence of various factors”, has resulted in the heavy rain in Tamil Nadu this northeast monsoon season, officials at India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.

The El Niño phenomenon — an unusual warming of surface waters in the equatorial Pacific Ocean — is “intensely strong” at present, Additional Director-General of Meteorology (Research) at IMD, B Mukhopadhyay, said. “In a strong El Niño year like the present one, the summer (southwest) monsoon is adversely affected, while the northeast monsoon or the winter monsoon is favourably affected.”

However, Mukhopadhyay added, “the present very heavy rain is exceptional and not normal.”

The 2015-16 El Niño could turn out to be the strongest ever recorded — in fact, by one measure, it has already reached that milestone. In mid-November, the sea surface temperature in the central tropical Pacific was 3 degrees Celsius warmer than normal, the largest positive deviation in recorded history. To officially beat the 1997-98 El Niño as history’s worst, sea surface temperatures must stay at these levels for three months.

Other than the El Niño, a strong upper air divergence and high moisture content at lower levels, have contributed to the rain, Mukhopadhyay said. “These two factors, along with formation of low pressure systems have resulted in the heavy rainfall,” he said.

For the last two days there has been a force in Chennai more powerful than the rains pounding the city. Social media. While bridges collapsed, floodgates opened and people were confined to their homes, citizens came together on social media – Twitter and >Facebook – to coordinate efforts to send or seek help with accommodation, food and rescue relief.

The people behind the joint effort at Chennairains.org, a Google spreadsheet listing helpline numbers, aid offers and requests, rescue requests, volunteer details and accommodation details has been, and is still being, widely shared, so that people can fill in details or provide necessary information to volunteers. The volunteers have been working all night – people from other cities and countries pitched in and took turns to stay awake. Soon, Twitter India shared the link and The Hindu hosted it on their website. Some volunteers kept track of certain hashtags including #chennairains, #chennaivolunteer, #chennairescue and #chennairainshelp.

A crowdsourced effort to map inundated roads in Chennai, along with information on vulnerable and water logged points and flood relief camps was put together by Arun Ganesh (see box). And as of 11.42 a.m. on Thursday, 5, 476 roads were flooded. Chennai Rains, an independent weather blogging community, put out regular updates on the situation of rains. Uber Chennai offered free rides all day and included trucks to help with carrying necessary supplies such as medicines and food, it said on its blog.

Individuals such as 22-year-old Harshitha Ravi helped both online and offline. “I feel like social media has been our saviour through all this. Even before heading out and helping, I had to check social media to ensure I was going to the right places, which required most help. Work online mainly includes circulating the right information and connecting demand with supply,” she says. Although Anush Rajasekaran and five of his friends were out distributing 18 to 19 crates of biscuits and drinking water yesterday, he plans to help more online.

What is it about social media that is an effective rallying point during disasters like this? During the Paris attacks, the #PorteOuverte or the ‘open-door’ initiative connected people who were looking for shelter. It popped up on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and opened doors for those looking for support. During the Jammu and Kashmir floods of 2014, people posted on Facebook relief and donation pages while Twitter used #JKFloodRelief and #JKFloodAlert to find information on missing people and rescuing them.

But what’s social media without the people behind it? Take the boys who run the Chennai Memes Facebook page, known usually for their hilarious trolls, who donned a different hat during crisis. Since the rains started, the boys have been updating statuses to share information about stranded residents, rescue operations, resource requirement and news updates. “We’ve helped many people find shelter or contact their loved ones. We also managed to get resources and volunteers for NGOs and other good samaritans who are mobilising help.” The biggest problem, they say, has been outdated information. But their work is not restricted to the internet alone, their admins have also been available on the ground, gathering food and distributing it. “Not many have access to Internet right now; that’s the biggest problem.”

With phone connectivity a big problem in the state and city, the Internet is a big boon for those looking and offering help. Berty Ashley’s rescue effort with his friends is guided mainly by Facebook posts and tweets calling out for help. “The internet is our lifeline now.” He rationalises that sending out a tweet elicits multiple responses, and says that collective reasoning and thought is more helpful in such situations. The need of the hour, he says, is people who own vehicles that can manoeuvre their way through difficult terrain. But for people who are unable to leave their homes and are still keen on helping, “just be an info hub.”

It’s an opinion that AM Aravind also voices. The Bangalore-based entrepreneur and brand consultant started working on a blog updating traffic information and road status inside and outside the city. His verified tweet on Chennai-Bangalore traffic proved useful – it garnered many thankful responses and more than a hundred retweets and counting. The one thing he says people sitting at home can do is “call and verify if the information is accurate and update.” At least those who have access to social media. Like the rumour on Porur Lake breaching which was not true and had a lot of residents scrambling and in panic. “People who are on Twitter-FB can keep a look out for such information and verify them. That would be really helpful.” Systems Engineer Vishwa, who also volunteered online, adds, “People should take care not to panic, first and then not pass unverified information to others. Also as many landlines were working (with mobile networks being down most of the time), it helps to call and check up on people nearby or based on requests.”

However, not everyone’s sitting by a desk. Sundar Ramu, who has been very active on social media since the rains started, is also out on the roads, helping with rescues. “There has been a deluge of calls and SOS messages. But we’ve also had a lot of volunteers stepping up. The challenge now is to try and get things organised, especially with the army stepping in.” The biggest problem, he says, is assessing who needs immediate attention. What with communication lines being down and power outrages being rampant, any sort help is welcome. “If you are safe and out of harm’s way, you are helping by simply not becoming a liability. You can work within your apartment or street; form teams to take care of the elderly, children and pets, and coordinate with those who are not tech savvy.” For those with access to electricity and social media, keep your eyes out for ways to pitch in: there’s always lots of help needed.

Arun Ganesh, a Bangalore-based map analyst, immediately set to work creating the crowdsourced map on November 27 and 28. ""It was an idea that started off with colleagues. We saw reports coming in about the flooding and we didn't have a clear picture of what was happening, on areas worst affected and so on. There was no granular idea on geographical conditions and we were really curious about the situation and decided to build a simple tool. It took us a day to put together, and we shared it on social media and people started picking it up. We wanted to use AA non-proprietary, open model (a software) using OpenStreetMap project where Chennai has already been mapped fairly well. We used this and elevation models from ISRO and quickly did an analysis of low lying areas - you'll see the darker areas on the map are low lying, we also used data from the UN which included analysis of satellite images of stagnated water.”",solution,Chennai Floods 2015,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 5, 2015","Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",1200 mm,100 billion USD,374,1.8 million people affected,https://chennairains.org/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

By the time Bijoy was taken to the ICU of the neighbouring Ramachandra Medical Institute, he was already dead, said doctors who coordinated the evacuation of patients marooned at MIOT Hospital in Manapakkam. “Around 18 patients from the critical care unit died due to the lack of an oxygen supply system following power failure,” said Dr Umesh Kumar, a physician who has been at MIOT Hospital for over seven years.

For patients, doctors and nurses at one of Chennai’s premier hospitals, life became hell for over 48 hours as flood water hit power, food supply, communication lines and road access.

Doctors and paramedical staff manually pumped oxygen (ambu bagging) for nearly 48 hours for critically ill patients after oxygen supply got cut off Tuesday night as flood water knocked off the back-up power generator located in the basement of one of three buildings that make up the hospital.

With the canteen located in the basement flooded as well, patients, attendants and hospital staff lived on biscuits and anything edible they could get their hands, said Dr Okorie, a paediatrician from Nigeria, whose seven-month-old son was on the mend at the hospital after he underwent an open heart surgery a few days ago.

While the patient count at the hospital stood at 575, spread over three buildings and nearly 20 floors, on Tuesday evening, it was down to around 60 patients — all on the third floor of the main building — by Friday morning. With power supply yet to be restored, the hospital wore a deserted look and the basement remained flooded with water from the Adyar river. A power generator rented by the hospital was being readied to supply power to remaining patients.

“Our patient strength was 575 on Tuesday but most of the patients have been moved out,” said Dr Kumar.

“We were on back-up power from Tuesday after the main power supply stopped. Late on Tuesday, water surged into the basement and the generator. This ruptured oxygen supply. For 48 hours, we manually ventilated critical patients like those with kidney failure,” said a visibly tired Dr Kumar. “I have been here for four days.”

The decision to move patients was taken only on Thursday afternoon, according to details provided by doctors with whom MIOT doctors coordinated. At the Ramachandra Medical Institute, where children from the MIOT cardio thoracic ICU were moved, the first patients arrived around 3.30 pm Thursday afternoon.

A total of 23 patients from MIOT were moved to Ramachandra Institute, while 11 infants of international origin, including Dr Okorie’s son, were moved to the Madras Medical Mission.

“It is an act of nature which they were not prepared for. I was at the hospital through the whole thing. Their power supply got blown off and, as a doctor, I know you cannot sustain ambu bagging for too long. Also, monitors providing vitals of patients were not working and this is disastrous in a modern hospital,” said Dr Okorie.

Many hospital staffers did not speak to their family for four days because phone lines were down. “I just got through to my family…they are safe,” said a young MIOT nurse, sobbing at the reception of the Madras Medical Mission hospital.

One of the decisions MIOT had to make was whether it wanted to move critical patients through flooded streets when the power back-up went kaput. “It is a tough call and sometimes it is better for a critical patient to stay put,” said a senior anaesthetist with a Chennai hospital where some patients from MIOT were taken.

“We tried to call for help and back-up power but phone lines were down. The roads to the hospital were also under six feet of water, making evacuation difficult,” said Dr Kumar.

With communication lines still down across Chennai, many hospitals have resorted to old-fashioned paging service on the hospital public address systems to reach out to doctors and staff when required.

Meanwhile, relatives of patients left behind at MIOT are unsure whether to move their kin out. “My 73-year-old father underwent an open heart surgery last Friday. He has stabilised and doctors at MIOT have said we don’t have to move him. We were supposed to visit him on Thursday but the roads were flooded and the hospital was cut off,” said Sujata, daughter of Radhakrishnan.

Home to over 165 BSE-listed companies (registered in Chennai) with an aggregate market capitalisation of over Rs 285,000 crore, the city is one of the biggest business centres in the country and the floods have caused major loss for companies as they were forced to shut their production facilities and operations were halted at IT hubs. Initial estimates suggest that the financial losses from the torrential rains and floods in Tamil Nadu may exceed Rs 15,000 crore.

The well-established presence of the automobile industry around the city include factories of Hyundai, Ford, BMW, Nissan, TVS, Renault-Nissan and Ashok Leyland, most of which were forced to shut production.

Commercial vehicle manufacturer Ashok Leyland has a plant at Ennore near Chennai, which accounts for about 40 per cent of the company’s production that span 18-seater to 82-seater double-decker buses and 7.5 tonne to 49 tonne haulage vehicles.

Hyundai Motor India Ltd’s facility in Sriperumbudur near Chennai has two plants producing 680,000 units between them. “Hyundai Motor India decided not to operate all three shifts today (Wednesday) and the first shift tomorrow (Thursday). This is the situation as of December 2, 5 PM and we are monitoring the situation,” HMIL said.

Ford with an annual capacity of 3.4 lakh engines and 2 lakh vehicles has also shut its plant down. “Continued heavy rains in Chennai have resulted in significant flooding in the area with many roads impassable. For the safety of our employees, we have halted production at our Chennai assembly and engine plants on Wednesday. We are monitoring the situation and will return to normal operations as soon as conditions improve… Most employees come from some distance away and so our primary focus is their safety. In all, we’ve had about three and a half days of shutdown,” a Ford India executive said.

The BMW Group too shut down production at its Chennai plant. In its statement, the BMW Group said, “Heavy rainfall has severely affected employee transportation in Chennai since December 1, 2015. Due to which BMW Plant in Chennai will not be able to undertake any production activities during December 1-4, 2015.”

TVS Motor Company, which is based in Chennai, had reported that over the last three weeks, the company suffered sales loss of approximately 15,000 units due to inclement weather. Delhi-based dealer for Renault-Nissan said that dealerships have been forewarned of the possibility of disruptions in shipments in the coming weeks on account of the current disruption in production.

“The financial loss due to record-breaking rainfall in Chennai and several parts of Tamil Nadu may even exceed Rs 15,000 crore mark as Chennai has come to a virtual standstill and is in the grip of fear and panic,” Assocham said on Wednesday.

Auto ancillary units around Chennai include Wabco India Ltd, Delphi-TVS Diesel Systems Ltd, Visteon and Caterpillar, among others. Chennai-based tyre manufacturers include Apollo Tyres, Bridgestone, JK Tyres, Michelin and MRF.

As the rain continued, the company, which has its largest office in Chennai with 60,000 people across 11 facilities, ferried some employees to other cities in a desperate attempt to avoid service outages.

But some companies looked on helplessly as systems went down. California-based technology firm Zoho Corporation, for example, found itself drowning in a flood of complaints from its mail service customers as the water level rose on Chennai streets.

Many enterprises believe that they can survive any disaster if they put in place a robust physical infrastructure and technical expertise. But floods in Chennai confirmed that technology companies need to do more to escape the ill-effects of natural disasters.Their business continuity plan (BCP) may not be complete if they just make sure that their data centers will never shut down and that their data centers are distributed across the world. Putting in place enough human resources is also just as important.

That’s precisely what happened in the case of Zoho. The technology firm has data centers spread across the world, but not the technical experts who investigate customer complaints. By the time the flood struck Chennai, Zoho had just been recovering from a devastating distributed-denial-of- service (DDOS) attack that slows down movement of mails through servers. “It was our complete bad luck that this bug showed up at the same time as the disaster. We are not using the natural disaster to mask another underlying cause,” explained the company in a blog post.

Then whose mistake was this? It was in fact a loophole in Zoho’s business continuity plan (BCP), because most of the technical staff and part of the company’s mail development team, is based in Chennai. As heavy rains turned Chennai into a pond, the city’s transportation system came to a standstill, forcing employees to stay back at home. But Zoho was badly in need of the technical expertise of the same team to respond to the bug’s unique aftereffects on the customer experience. They were up against a different struggle, while Zoho was up against the software bug.

“Now if that R&D team is unavailable for any reason, the issue remains unresolved until they return, and the customer unfortunately suffers,” went on Zoho in its blog post. Frankly, relying on a single technical staff in a single location was Zoho’s drawback.

Realizing that Chennai might take a longer time to recover, Zoho opened up customer support centers in Austin (USA) and Tenkasi (India). Furthermore, it moved about 50 technical staff to Bangalore, India’s Silicon city about 350 kilometerss west of Chennai, to set up another emergency customer service and support center. At last, Zoho normalized the service, but it was a bit struggle for its employees to console customers. “Disasters and software bugs are not new to technology companies. They must anticipate these disasters well in advance and prepare a foolproof contingency plan,” says Abhishek Gupta, an expert in BCP and Disaster Recovery in Bangalore.

The effects of a lack of planning can be devastating for small companies, say analysts. As many as 40 to 60 percent of small businesses never recover after being hit by natural disasters, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Considering the 2015 Travelers Business Risk Index, only 21 percent of small businesses have continuity plans.

“Some firms can survive service outages for days on end, but firms in some industries cannot survive a outage even for a minute. Banks and stock exchanges will lose millions of dollars even though they suffer an outage for few minutes,” Gupta added.

Thanks to strong contingency plans, most of the large technology firms escaped from the ill-effects of Chennai floods. “We activated the Business Continuity Plan and other centers took over the jobs we handled. This is a usual practice during emergencies,” said Ravi Viswanathan, head of Chennai operations at TCS, according to The Hindu Business Line.

When smaller enterprises get caught in a disaster, they should immediately email customers and use a work-from-home policy for its employees, suggest some analysts. “They typically rely on a single location, which makes them especially vulnerable. Even relying on insurance coverage to replace lost income cannot replace clients,” said manjunath Hegde, a independent IT analyst in Bangalore.

Small enterprises can no longer ignore business continuity plans. Some big companies now even require small businesses to have a continuity plan in place before they will work with them.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Cut to Pune. Over the last few years, the city has seen many flash floods, which town planners and experts blame on disappearance of natural streams and water bodies. They say that of late, the city has been witnessing floods even during medium rains, which is a cause for alarm as the city might go the Chennai way during heavy rainfall.

Geographically, the city of Pune lies in a valley with many small and medium streams meandering down its area to empty at the Mula-Mutha basin. In their study, researchers Tushar Shitole, principal of Mamasaheb Mohol college, and Shrikant Gabale, a PhD scholar, have identified six major basins that are active in and around the city – Ramnadi, Ambil Odha, Nandusi, Bhairoba nala, Wadki nala and Wagholi nala.

A natural water stream is the path rainwater takes to drain into bigger water bodies. Using topographical sheets and Google earth imagery, the researchers have studied almost all the basins and the results are disturbing.

Ramnadi Basin

Back in 2010, the tiny river of Ramnadi was in the news for the havoc its flash floods created in the Baner-Bavdhan area, leaving 11 people dead. The public outrage in its aftermath prompted authorities to say they would raze illegal encroachments as well as demarcate red and blue flood lines for the river. While majority of the encroachments were pulled down, the demarcation of red and blue flood lines (construction within these lines is not allowed) is yet to happen.

During the course of their research, Shitole and Gabale found that almost 20 per cent of the secondary streams draining in Ramnadi had vanished and the width of the stream had reduced by almost 15 per cent. Of the 416 streams draining into the Ramnadi, 106 have vanished while the rest are at threat of disappearing due to the construction boom in the area.

Along with Ramnadi, the tiny river of Devnadi in the neighbouring Baner area has also been under a lot of stress due to encroachment.

Local residents had even moved a PIL in the Bombay High Court the problem. Anupam Saraph of the Baner Balewadi Area Sabha said that although the High Court had asked for removal of sewage lines and debris from the area, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had failed to do so. “The rivers are the lifelines in maintaining the water cycle in the area. Since the civic body has taken up channelisation work which involves concretisation of Devnadi, the wells have dried up in the area. Incidents of heavy rains invariably leads to flooding as the water is neither able to seep into the ground nor able to flow along the body of the river,” Saraph said.

Ambil Odha basin

In June 2013, flash floods near Shindewadi on National Highway 4 washed away a woman and her child. According to Gabale, the flash floods in this region were caused due to the closure of the waterways in the upper reaches of the rivulet Ambil Odha, which happens to one of the most important tributaries of the Mutha river. With 40 per cent of the first-order streams of the Ambil Odha lost forever, the researchers say, danger of flash floods in this area remains real. “These are the waterways which the rainwater take for surface run-off and their disappearance is dangerous for the local hydrology of the area and can lead to flash floods,” says Gabale. The district administration had taken up the issue of removing unauthorised construction in the area but the threat of flash floods still remains.

Wagholi-Kharadi basin

The heavy rains which lashed the city towards November-end caused deep distress for residents of Lohegaon, Dhanori and nearby areas. Waterlogging was reported from numerous areas, causing severe damage to vehicles and property. This area, home to huge construction boom, has also seen some of the largest loss of water streams.

Local resident Sameer Patil talks about how they had to pull down a compound wall as the water level was fast accumulating there. “Even during moderate rains, water-logging is a problem in the area. However, when it started raining continuously, the water level was fast increasing. We had no other way but to pull down the wall to allow the water to flow through,” he says.

This, town planners and geographers say, was a clear sign of the vanishing water streams in the area. In the Wagholi basin area, 34.78 per cent of the streams have vanished due to unplanned growth. Similarly, the Bhairoba Nala and Wadki Nala, which traverse through Hadapsar and its neighbourhood areas, have lost 22.73 and 16.56 per cent of their streams. With construction boom continuing unchecked in these areas, locals fear a Chennai-like situation here.

“There is no space left for the water to drain out due to construction of embankment walls. The magnitude of flooding can be reduced by allowing channels for the water to pass through,” Shitole says.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Nearly 400 people, including university students, were taken to safety today by a team of defence and NDRF personnel as operations continued in full swing to rescue and distribute relief to those stranded in the aftermath of the torrential rains in Chennai.

Defence aircraft as also a couple of civilian ones ferried people to Delhi and Hyderabad since morning even as IAF flew sorties to bring more people to the naval base here that has played a critical role in the overall operations.

“An IndiGo flight will soon fly to Delhi with 150 people on board,” a senior naval official said.

‘INS Rajali’, the naval base here and the Tambaram Air Base, about 30km outside of Chennai, have been working in tandem over the past several days to bring people to safety.

Over 600 people, including stranded civilians and defence personnel, were yesterday flown out from here.

“We sent about 300 people from the Tambaram Base to Arakonnam Base throughout the day. No more sorties are planned as yet,” said Flight Lieutenant Mohanan Chandrika at Tamabaram Base.

The navy official added that Mi-14 and AN-32 brought people in batches to the base as operations continued this morning.

Meanwhile, as large areas of Chennai airport remained flooded, commercial operations continued to be suspended there although technical flights have commenced.

The Arakonnam base, located 70km west of Chennai, is currently serving as the makeshift airport.

Civilian aircraft started a few rescue flights from yesterday and four sorties ferried about 320 people from here to different place.

“A TrueJet flight and a SpiceJet flight took people to Hyderabad and Bangalore, respectively, yesterday morning and two flights of IndiGo ferried rescued persons to Delhi,” the official said.

Around 150 people, among them 130 rescued civilians and the rest from the defence forces, were flown out on an IndiGo flight yesterday afternoon from the base. The other IndiGo flight, carrying 180 people, had left at night.

“A C-17 Globemaster carrying 196 people was also later flown in yesterday as chopper sorties brought in more people later in the day, including 70 students from the Chennai-based SRM University who had been flown into Tamabaram Air Base earlier.

Chennai, Dec 5: With Tamil Nadu reeling under the worst floods to hit the state in a century and with rescue operations getting underway, actors Siddharth and RJ Balaji, popular among Tamil audiences, turned out to help the people. Siddharth was one of the victims of the rains. His house in the city was submerged, but that didn’t stop him from stepping out and helping those in need.

Along with Balaji, who is also a popular radio jockey, the “Rang De Basanti” star formed teams to help stranded people in different parts of the city. People came forward and lent their cars which were used to rescue people from the flooded areas. Siddharth was soon joined by actors Vishnu Vishal, Udhayanidhi Stalin, Karthi, Khushbu Sundar and Vishal Krishna Reddy. Popular multiplexes like SPI Cinemas and AGS Cinemas opened their doors to offer shelter.

The two-member team grew bigger with the support of many volunteers, mostly from the common people. “It was heartening to see Siddharth and Balaji come out and help people. We were touched by their gesture and thus wanted to help too,” Ram Kumar, who joined Siddharth and his team of volunteers, told IANS.

The teams went around the city collecting food packets, 50 to 100 per batch, and other essentials and getting them delivered to people. Those who couldn’t come out and volunteer were requested to send donations to Chennai Micro Fund trust, which was used to carry out relief work. Social media played a pivotal role in this movement, helping the city to get back on its feet.

Rescue and relief operations were carried out with the help of Twitter. Since most telecommunication networks took a hit due to the heavy downpour, people used the social media platform to reach out to one another.From updating people about the situation on the ground to tracking somebody’s whereabouts with the website chennairains.org collating all information, social media played a big role.

Support also came from maestro Ilayaraja who, on learning that the Little Flower Convent catering to visually challenged, deaf and mute children was under four feet of water, immediately paid them a visit. The 72-year-old insisted on meeting the children, despite being warned of the high water level.

Mamata held the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) responsible for the “abnormal” release of water from their barrages, claiming this resulted in the current situation, causing a huge loss of property and lives, a charge denied by the DVC.

Mamata added that she has sought appointment with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during her visit in Delhi on August 11 and 12 to discuss the situation and demand help from the National Disaster Relief Fund.

She added that she will submit a report to the Prime Minister and raise some crucial issues like modernisation and renovation of reservoirs owned by DVC — mostly in Jharkhand. “West Bengal will no more allow DVC to inundate Bengal. The death toll has gone up to 83,” she said, adding that she has lodged a complaint with Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal in this

regard.

“The DVC headquarters is located in Bengal. It was doing business from Bengal, but has also inundating the state. It should have taken up modernisation work. Proper dredging could have given DVC the capacity to retain an additional 200,000 cusecs of water and it could have prevented the flooding of Bengal,” Mamata said.

Responding to Mamata’s allegations, a DVC spokesperson said: “We are constantly trying to find a suitable agency for dredging, but are yet to identify anyone.”

On Tuesday as well, DVC released 120,000 cusecs of water. It, however, countered the charge of excess discharge from its barrages, saying the release of water from the DVC system was not the reason for flooding in downstream areas.

“The flooding over the past few days is mainly due to the high tidal effects and Komen depression-related rainfall. The combined release on August 3 was 95,000 cusecs, which is lower than the safe downstream channel carrying capacity of the Damodar river, which is 1,10,000 cusecs,” DVC said in a release.

The DVC added that in spite of the unprecedented heavy rainfall in Jharkhand and West Bengal, DVC dams at Panchet and Maithon had been able to moderate the flow of water to a significant extent of 68 per cent for the last two days.

Meanwhile, the flood situation in South Bengal improved slightly as a result of no rain, reduced discharge of water from barrages and waning tides. The chief minister said 4.31 lakh people have taken shelter in 2,449 relief camps in the 12 affected districts.

Fourteen more people died, taking the state toll to 83. “Altogether, 2,449 relief camps have been set up to shelter over 4.31 lakh marooned people and 470 medical camps opened,” a source said, adding that the total number of affected people was over 61 lakh. Sources claimed that 1,07,808 houses were damaged and 3,68,238 houses destroyed partly. Crop over an area of 7,97,848 hectares has been damaged due to the floods.

With no rains and waning tides, the water level has started receding from inundated areas in Burdwan, Hooghly, Howrah, West Midnapore, East Midnapore, South-24 Parganas, North-24 Parganas, Nadia, Murshidabad, Bankura and Birbhum districts, state Irrigation Minister Rajib Banerjee said.

“All BDOs and SDOs have been asked to submit reports as early as possible. The state government wants to disburse relief funds to the people with a notification by August 18,” said Mamata.

She added that the state finance minister has been asked to speak to banks regarding waiver of agricultural loans. “The department has been asked to advice if the farmers can take up cultivation of any alternative crop once the water receded.

The devastating rains that created havoc in Chennai and neighbouring districts earlier this month, was due to slow movement of weaker systems present over Bay of Bengal, which subsequently led to 53 per cent higher rainfall than the average, the weather office said on Thursday.

“As the clouds above the sea were normal, the weaker systems like trough, low pressure moved slowly bringing copious rainfall,” Regional Meteorological Centre Director S.R. Ramanan told reporters here.

He was giving a detailed analysis on the rainfall registered during the North East Monsoon that normally sets in during the October-December period for Tamil Nadu and neighbouring Puducherry.

“On an average, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry receives 44 cm of rainfall during the North East Monsoon. This year the rainfall recorded is 68 cm in these three months, which is 53 per cent more,” he said.

In 2013, rainfall received was 33 per cent less compared to average rainfall. In 2014, October received heavy rain but there was no rain in the next two months. “But, in 2015 the rainfall received in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry was very good and it was similar to 2005,” he said.

Giving statistics, he said Kancheepuram district registered the heaviest rainfall — 183 per cent higher at 181.5 cm as against average rainfall of 64 cm in October-December period.

Tiruvallur district recorded 146 cm compared to average 59 cm of rain while Chennai, which normally receives 79 cm of rainfall, recorded 160 cm, 104 per cent above average, he said.

To a query, he said if the weaker low pressure or trough moved towards Gulf of Mannar region, south interior districts would also have received “record rainfall”. “Since the weaker systems were moving slowly or almost remained stationary, the coastal districts received heavy rainfall,” he added.

Due to heavy rains earlier this month, Chennai and neighbouring districts were inundated. According to the government, 345 persons lost their lives in rain-related incidents during the period while many were rendered homeless.

Asked if the North East Monsoon may be considered inactive following conclusion of the season from today, he said, “Even today Pechchiparai in Kanyakumari district received 4 mm of rainfall. But if there is no rainfall for four to five days, we may say the monsoon has ceased.”

He said the formation of El Nino in Pacific Ocean, an abnormal weather pattern that causes warming of Pacific Ocean, was also one of the reasons that brought heavy rain in December in coastal districts.",flood,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 15, 2015","Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Cuddalore, Villupuram, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Tiruchirappalli, Karur, Salem, Namakkal, Erode, Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram, Virudhunagar, Thoothukudi, and Kanyakumari",160 cm,"Rs. 10,000 crore",345,18.3 million people affected,"The floods were caused by slow movement of weaker systems present over Bay of Bengal, which subsequently led to 53 per cent higher rainfall than the average.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

After a parched summer spent struggling for water, Sangam Vihar in South Delhi found itself flooded on Friday when rains lashed the area for the second consecutive day. Residents trudged through knee-deep water and blamed the poor drainage system in this large, unauthorised colony.

By 2 pm on Friday, most of the colony was partially under water. There were reports about 14 buildings collapsing, while belongings from various homes floated aimlessly in the water. The many open drains in the colony were completely obscured by the rising water level, and parents chose to keep their children at home. Cars struggled to make their way out of the colony to bring in supplies, many spluttering to a stop half-way.

“Most of the year, we have no water to drink. And during the monsoons, we have a problem of plenty. There is so much water and none of it drains out. The drains are clogged through the year and though politicians make their promises during elections, nothing ever comes of it,” said Manoj Kumar, a resident.

A child was injured after a portion of a building in the area collapsed, police said, adding that he was taken to the AIIMS Trauma Centre and is currently out of danger.

The building collapse was symptomatic of the negligence by the authorities, claimed residents. “It’s been raining since Thursday and, as a result, one part of the building had become weak since water was collecting outside it. On Friday, it rained heavily and the water level kept on rising. As a result, a section of the building collapsed,” said Dilip Kumar, owner of the collapsed house.

On Twitter, AAP MLA from Sangam Vihar Dinesh Mohaniya admitted that “around 15 houses collapsed” in the rain and pleaded that packed food for 300 people was required urgently.

Residents also alleged that clogged drains, ignored by the civic bodies, were the main cause of the water logging.

“Right now, the water is up to our knees. If it keeps on rising, more houses will collapse and lives might even be lost. The drains aren’t cleaned regularly. Even when sanitation workers clean the area, they dump all the waste into the drains. It is mindless and it happens every year,” said Riju Kumar, a resident.

A South MCD official said that while it had information regarding the collapse of two buildings in the colony and reports of water-logging from various areas, it was unfair to blame the civic body for the problem.

“The problem is that the development in an area like Sangam Vihar has simply not been in tune with the growth of population. The population density is such that the drainage system can’t keep up,” he said.

At least 20 cases of dengue have been reported in Delhi this year, according to a report by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC).

The maximum number of cases was reported from South Delhi (7), while East Delhi recorded three cases. Another six cases were reported from North Delhi, the report said. The SDMC compiles the dengue and malaria report on behalf of all civic bodies in the city.

“While dengue cases are being reported, the number is expected to be lower this year as we have taken all precautionary measures to ward off the vector-borne disease,” a senior official of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation said on Friday. During the same time last year, 16 cases were reported.

After the report was released, officials of the Delhi government’s Health Department said they are intensifying their efforts to contain dengue this year. “Delhi had a very bad time with the disease in 2013 and 2014. We are working hard to ensure that this isn’t the case this year as well. Apart from awareness drives, we’ll work closely with civic bodies to ensure that all precautions are being taken,” the official said.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Meanwhile, the Gram Panchayat authorities, local leaders and PES representatives set out to find a permanent solution for the problem.



On Friday, the PES management had to evacuate students from hostels in the wake of the flood. Dramatic events ensued as fire services personnel got boats to ferry students out of the campus.



According to fire department officials, the water was up to four feet. By Saturday evening, they were able to flush it out by half. “As of now, the situation is under control. We are withdrawing our services by Saturday evening,” a fire personnel said.



A meeting of all stakeholders is being convened on August 20, MLA M Krishnappa said.

“The water has stagnated for the last three or four years. I met the officials concerned on Saturday and discussed the issue. On Wednesday, we will do a spot inspection to trace the origin of the problem and explore whether any sewage treatment plants are responsible for the huge inflow of water.”



Why water-logging?



The PES (South Campus) faces the Electronics City flyover and is situated towards Rayasandra Lake (2 km away). On the other side of the flyover is Electronics City Phase I and the Doddathoguru lake.



A stormwater drain (Rajakaluve) is linked from Doddathoguru lake to Rayasandra lake.

The drain passes through PES campus and continues through a private property behind. After this is a road and the drain has to continue below the road on to the other side and from there flow into Rayasandra Lake.



It is alleged that the road behind PES campus is the original ‘Rajakaluve’ (according to maps), while the one passing through the campus is a branched out channel meant to flow into the Rajakaluve.



The vacant plot behind PES campus has been used by builders to dump construction debris. Also, property owners have blocked the drain with sand mounds.



As a result, flow of water was permanently blocked and following heavy rain, water swelled in the debris plot and overflowed into the institute's compound.



PES Institute of Technology Çhief Operating Officer Ajoy Kumar said, “It looks like a lake. But it is stagnated water as there is no exit point for the drain.”



Meanwhile, since the flood, the institute has dug a trench, ensuring water flow towards the Rayasandra Lake.



“We are looking at opening the campus on Monday. Electricity supply is back and sumps have to be cleaned,” the PESIT chief operating officer added.



More than 200 hostel students of the South campus have been shifted to the PES Hosakerehalli campus.

Residents and motorists say the area gives them nightmares. The Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) did take up asphalting the road, but never completed it. Similar is the case in the surrounding areas.



“The BBMP, on the pretext of asphalting the stretch from Hennur Cross towards Hennur village, laid jelly stones three months ago. But it has not tarred the stretch till date. After it rained heavily in the last couple of days, jelly stones were scattered all over. It is common to see drains overflowing during rains,” said Muniraju N, secretary of Hennur Residents’ Welfare Association.



Hennur main road is an approach road that connects to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) and is used by motorists to reach Bellary Road, Devanahalli and other areas.



The executive engineer of HBR Layout ward blames the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) for causing the mess. The BBMP’s Major Public Works Committee members, on the other hand, said that they would soon prepare an estimate and draw an action plan to fill potholes and asphalt the Hennur main road.



Meanwhile, residents of Byraveshwara Layout near Hennur lament the loss of their household items during the recent flash floods. Susheela A N, wife of a retired BBMP official, said: “Our television set, kitchen items, furniture, car and electronic goods were damaged in the heavy rainfall on October 8. There was about four feet of water inside our house.”



Residents maintained that since the layout is low-lying, water from the surrounding areas enters the locality, flooding their houses.



“The drains are not linked to a nearby Storm Water Drain (SWD). The problem can be solved by setting up an approach link from the drains to an SWD,” said Ramaiah HM, a resident.



Home Minister and Sarvagnanagar MLA, K J George, inspected the area a week ago but no permanent solution has been sought till date. In Chikkana Garden, Papanna Layout and many surrounding areas, dirty water flows into open gutters in the absence of a proper drainage system.

The south-west monsoon for the year 2014 officially ended on September 30. Overall the monsoon has been a mixed bag with many areas of India having a deficit but some areas having a surplus. In the city of Bangalore we were confronted with heavy rains in September; on one particular day it rained more than 120 mm in a short span of a few hours, causing flooding. This will be the pattern in cities, floods at certain times and shortage of piped water at the same time.

As cities get paved, creating hard impenetrable surfaces, the ability of rainwater to percolate into the soil and thence to the aquifer reduces to almost zero. Surface run-off increases dramatically and can go up by a factor of 9. The garbage-choked drains have to cope with a high intensity of rainfall and substantially increased run-off, not to mention buildings in valleys and low lying areas, causing urban floods. At the root of this phenomenon is lack of planning, and building in the wrong places. Not respecting drainage lines and flood plains exacerbates the situation. What can be done about it?

One remedy is to design and plan for every urban micro-watershed by reducing run-off and increasing infiltration into the soil and aquifers. A recharge well is a good way of doing this.

What is a recharge well? Usually a precast concrete ring lined structure, typically a metre or 1.5 metres in diameter and going to a depth of 3 to 8 metres, a recharge well takes water run-off from rooftops, paved areas and roads, filters it and sends it underground to increase the water table. Unlike a conventional well which taps into the aquifer, the recharge well sends water into the aquifer. By changing the flow of rainwater into the ground it is possible to mitigate the impact of floods.

A well-designed recharge well, depending on the soil profile of a place, can send a million litres of water annually into the ground. By coordinating a given catchment area, the coefficient of runoff and the infiltration rate at a place, appropriate recharge wells can be made and the numbers required can be arrived at. They can be linked to the stormwater drains present and placed within the drains itself.

Layouts, apartments and institutions have found that they become zero storm-water discharge zones and have had the added benefit of increased water availability in their borewells and open wells.

It is time that we use the recharge well as an important tool in the sustainable management of water in our cities and in preventing or mitigating floods. October is one of the rainiest months in the city of Bangalore and it would be best that October rains are directed into our wells. The time is now.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The month of September is not among the favourite times of the year for travellers from Bangalore to Jammu and Kashmir, which is now battered by heavy rainfall and floods. This month falls between the two peak tourist seasons of Kashmir.

According to tourism industry insiders, the peak season for Jammu and Kashmir is between April and July, and October and December. Many visit the State during this off-peak season owing to the bait of low hotel tariffs.

“The number of travellers to Kashmir is low right now. If the flooding had happened in the peak season, the situation would have been far worse for tourists,” said Sanjar Imam, vice-president of the Karnataka Travel Forum.

Besides, those visiting the temple shrine of Vaishno devi, near Jammu, also extended their travel to Srinagar.

Also, with Ladakh region emerging as a favourite destination for adventure-seekers and bikers, many prefer to travel to Srinagar and Jammu region.

Following the rain, an unexpected spate occurred in streams like Nallathangal and Karasavaikkal nearby Kalipatti village in Oddanchatram taluk.Around 20 persons, who were staying in a farm, got trapped and three people fell unconsciousness. The current was so powerful, the fire personnel could not avail boats for the rescue operation and efforts by local police were futile. Close by, a small bridge connecting Palani - Dindigul highways was washed away unable to withstand the force of the floods. Heavy rains lashed several parts of the district on Monday night, leading to floods near Oddanchatram and Palani areas.Later, chief minister O Panneerselvam decided to seek help from the IAF and NDRF, after the state fire and rescue personnel could not reach the area due to heavy rains, said an official release. On requests from the state, a helicopter from Sulur Indian Air Force Station swung into action and 40 NDRF personnel from Arakkonam joined the operation, to rescue all 10 persons, including a 14-year-old girl, Varshini and 16-year-old boy, Surya. The rest managed to escape by themselves. They were later taken to Palani government hospital for a check up.In rest of the state, the active north-east monsoon brought cheer to water managers. It was a bright sunny day in Chennai after four days of incessant rains. Almost all major reservoirs in the state have been receiving good rains thereby raising the water storage level. Amaravathi, Papanasam and Thirumurthy dams received more than 6cms in the 24 hours ending Monday morning.

Two persons have been reported to be washed away in floods in Mahasamund and Kanker.Unconfirmed reports claimed that a minor girl was washed away in Mahasamund area. The other case was from Kanker from where a man was washed away in swollen Kotri river. Officials have only confirmed loss of property worth lakh but denied any deaths.With water flowing well above the danger mark in these districts in rivers Sodur, Pari, Jonk, Tale, Indravati and Doodh, flood alerts have been issued for various villages in the vicinity of the river embankments and evacuations carried out in some areas. Gariyaband district administration has already evacuated 86 girls studying at Adivasi Balika Ashram in Pantora village and shifted them to the district headquarter.While the state has so far recorded 422.5 mm of rains since June 1, over 350 mm of downpour has been received in the past 48 hours.

He said water levels at Sikasar dam had reached dangerous levels, forcing the administration to release over 20,000 cusecs of water on Tuesday morning. Release of water, coupled with heavy downpour and gusty winds, flooded Pari river, which was flowing 2.5 feet above the danger mark since last noon.Electricity supply to major parts of the districts has been affected due to uprooting of supply lines and power poles and almost two lakh people are without electricity. Das said it would take another 12 to 18 hours to restore power supply to the affected areas.Das said the administration might have to release more water from Sikasar dam, as the levels were rising again. He revealed that connectivity to 36 villages, with a population of over 20,000 people, falling on the downstream of Tale river towards Devbhog area had been completely cut off. He said since the villages fall on the border, their connectivity with Odisha was open.Das said about 100 villages in the Churu block were also marooned and their connectivity to Gariyaband district headquarters was cut off.Officials of Mahasamund administration, said the Jonk river, about 40-45 kms from the district headquarters, was flowing almost six feet above danger mark. Waters from swollen Jonk river had flooded the National Highway 353, cutting off connection between Sambalpur and Odisha.He said 250 people were struck at some local area and efforts were on to rescue them.

The small village of Laupani is nearby. In the distance, a pink evening light shines on the snowy ridges of the eastern Himalayas.

""When I came to the village to marry, 42 years ago, it took an hour to walk to the river,"" says Bhujel. ""Now the river's waters are here, eating away at our land, heaping sand on our paddy fields.""

The Brahmaputra is one of the world's mightiest rivers, 10km wide in places. Its waters rise more than 5,000 metres up the Tibetan Plateau and flow for about 3,000km through China, India and Bangladesh before joining the Ganges and emptying into the Bay of Bengal.

The river is a lifeline to millions, delivering vital nutrients to the plains of Assam and other areas, but its fast flowing waters also cause widespread misery. In 2012, more than 1.5 million people in Assam were displaced by floods, with many lives lost and whole villages washed away.

Bhujel is 70. Her calloused hands and lined face are testament to a lifetime of hard work on the land. She is dressed in a widow's white sari: her husband died last year.

""We once had three bighas of land [one bigha is about a third of an acre], but most of it has been eaten away by the river. The last thing my husband did before he died was sell our cattle.""

In part the flooding and land erosion is a natural phenomenon. The Brahmaputra carries a vast volume of water, an amount only exceeded by the Amazon and Congo rivers.

As the Brahmaputra's waters cascade down from the mountains on to the soft alluvial soils of Assam, they eat away at the river's banks and deposit tons of sand on nearby lands, turning once verdant areas into what looks like an enormous beach.

North-eastern India is a highly seismic zone. An earthquake in 1950 was one of the most violent recorded, altering the geology of the entire Brahmaputra river basin and raising the river level by eight to 10 metres in places.

But rampant deforestation, particularly in areas further upstream, is another factor driving land loss.

""Over time different rivers in the Brahmaputra basin have merged, braiding over a very wide area, and thousands of square kilometres of paddy fields have been lost,"" says Professor Jogendra Nath Sarma, a local geologist who has been studying the Brahmaputra for years.

""Population growth and immigration from Bangladesh and other areas has put a big strain on Assam's land resources. In the past people would migrate to higher ground during the monsoon and flooding season, but now there is nowhere for them to go."".

Laupani is almost entirely populated by Nepalis, whose ancestors migrated from their mountain homes to the plains of Assam in search of a better life more than a century ago.

Subhakar Subedi, the village chief, says farmers are experimenting with more flood resistant rice strains. Others are turning what land they have left into small tea gardens or vegetable plots.

There are pools of stagnant water, left behind by last year's floods. They provide ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes; malaria, says Subedi, is on the rise.

The government has erected flood defences in some areas. Aaranyak, a locally based NGO, has joined forces with the Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development – the only transboundary organisation looking at development issues across the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region – to install a number of flood early warning devices along the Brahmaputra's banks.

Subedi says the government in New Delhi should be doing more.

""Our ancestors were poor but we are poorer. The politicians come – especially now, at election time – and say they will help us. But little happens – it's all wada, wada [promises, promises].""

India's north-east is a tribal area. With its tea plantations and plentiful natural resources, including oil and coal, it was once one of the country's richest regions. Now it is one of the poorest.

Many people in the area feel cut off from the rest of India and neglected by central government. There have been frequent violent clashes between indigenous groups and central government authorities.

There are few young men in Laupani. With little land left to farm, many have migrated in search of work, mainly to cities such as Chennai and Bangalore in southern India.

People in Laupani and elsewhere along the Brahmaputra face other challenges. Many glaciers in the eastern Himalayas and on the Tibetan Plateau that feed into the Brahmaputra are melting due to higher temperatures.

Accumulations of soot-like black carbon pollutants on the snowy peaks cause more heat to be absorbed, hastening glacial melt. In the short term this could lead to larger and more volatile river water flows.

Both India and China, its northerly neighbour, are involved in a large-scale dam building programme on upstream areas of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries. The consequences for downstream communities are uncertain.

Bhujel is concerned with the day to day. One of her grandsons is using bamboo poles to build a new, temporary dwelling for the extended family.

""With every monsoon season, we fear we will have to move again. The river is always hungry for more land,"" she says.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

While at least 40 persons have lost their lives in the Garo Hills in Meghalaya, as many as 26 bodies have been fished out from the water in Goalpara and Kamrup districts in Assam in the past two days. Confirming this, Assam forest minister Rakibul Hussain said the final death figure could be much more because many people are reportedly missing and suspected to have been washed away. “Many villages are still totally submerged, with water flowing above the roofs. Rescue teams have yet to cover all the affected villages,” Hussain said.

Though columns of the Army and BSF are pressed into rescue operations alongside the NDRF and SDRF teams, they have not been able to reach out because most villages are still submerged, the minister pointed out. The number of cattle and other domestic animals washed away are yet to be ascertained.

In Goalpara, of the 14 bodies recovered so far, two are infants, they being Apsara Hujuri (one year two months) and Prakash Rabha (two years six months). The dead also include five women, Hussain said. In Kamrup district on the other hand 12 bodies have been recovered so far. With five deaths in Guwahati city and one in Dhubri, the total death toll in the last three days’ floods in Assam has gone up to 31.

The flood waters came down like a huge wall several metres high and even washed away trucks and cars off the NH 37 for several hundred metres. In Krishnai, Dudhnoi and Bolbola, all highway townships, trucks, cars and other vehicles are lying strewn by the roadside after the floodwaters were gone. In Bolbola, at least 180 persons were killed in a flash flood in 2004.

Minister Hussain, who visited Goalpara and Kamrup today said at least six lakh population have been affected by floods in the two districts in since Sunday night. While four lakh have been affected in Kamrup, 2.11 lakh have been affected in Goalpara. About 1.4 lakh people have been put up in relief camps while thousands have taken shelter under the open sky on the highway and other roads.

Several bridges that have been washed away include an RCC bridge on the Krishnai river in Goalpara. “There has been extensive damage to the National Highway, railway track, state roads as well as village roads. A final assessment will be possible only when the floods recede further in the next two or three days,” minister Hussain informed.

Meanwhile, several localities in Guwahati city continued to remain submerged for the third day today after flash floods hit the Assam capital following incessant rains since Saturday. The army was deployed in Anilnagar and Tarun-nagar, two worst-hit localities.

Rajnath Singh today calls up Tarun Gogoi:

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday called up Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi to take stock of the flood situation in the state. Official sources said while Singh called up in the morning, Gogoi apprised the Home Minister about the slew of steps initiated by the state government to rescue the marooned people in the flood-hit areas of Goalpara, Dhubri, Kamrup (Metro), Kamrup and other districts with the assistance of NDRF, SDRF, Army and paramilitary forces. Gogoi told Singh that scores of marooned people have been evacuated and efforts are on to rescue the stranded ones.

The chief minister also told the union home minister about a slight improvement in the flood situation following a let-up in rainfall in the past 24 hours. However, Gogoi described the situation as ‘grim and critical’. Gogoi also apprised about the relief operations being carried out by the district administrations and the opening up of relief camps for the flood affected people.

For six years, owing to an aquifer that South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) engineers now claim they “missed” during the time of soil-testing, water has been constantly flowing into the basement of the hospital.

As construction workers dug two floors underground to provide parking at the eight-storey multi-speciality hospital, the water from the aquifer filled the basement, which the workers have been pumping out continuously.

The ambitious project, approved by the unified corporation in 2008, remains under construction even two and a half years post deadline. The project was approved at a cost of approximately Rs 31 crore. However, due to delays and cost escalation, the present expenditure stands well over Rs 52 crore, according to Leader of the Opposition in SDMC Farhad Suri.

“This is double-speak on behalf of the SDMC staff as, on the one hand, they say they conducted soil-testing at the site and, on the other, they claim anywhere you dig in the area, water is bound to spring up,” Suri said.

Speaking to Newsline, Leader of the House in SDMC Subhash Arya said the funds for the hospital were provided to the corporation in phases, which caused the delay in construction. He said tenders for electricity and other fittings were being finalised, but “a final date for completion cannot yet be fixed”. “The hospital needs an investment of an additional Rs 3 crore. We will provide that soon and hopefully the project will be completed this year,” Arya said.

The hospital, named after former BJP MLA from Kalkaji Poornima Sethi, was expected to be completed within two and a half years. Until now, only the structure of the 100-bed hospital is ready and utility services, sewer and water connections as well as equipment for the hospital have been arranged.

“In my capacity as Leader of the Opposition, I will file a complaint with the National Green Tribunal on Wednesday, as gallons of potable water are being drained into the sewers that can resolve the water scarcity in the Kalkaji area,” Suri said.

Extreme weather — including massive storms such as Typhoon Haiyan and Hurricane Sandy, and severe floods and droughts — is likely to become more frequent and intense as global warming accelerates1.

Links in global economic chains and world markets mean that extreme weather in one place can have repercussions elsewhere. For example, a combination of exceptional rainfall and Cyclone Yasi in 2010–11 paralysed the world's fourth-largest region of coal exploration in Queensland, Australia. Coking coal prices rose the following year by 25%. In 2011, droughts and floods in Russia, Pakistan and Australia caused global food prices to climb, possibly contributing to the escalation of civil unrest in Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia. The long-term economic impacts of Typhoon Haiyan, which devastated the Philippines in November 2013, are yet to be felt, but are likely to affect global trade and manufacturing.

Yet the impacts of adverse weather on supply chains are missing from the assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change1, and, with a few exceptions2, are being ignored in discussions around adaptation. This is a mistake. Adaptation requires a global strategy, not just local ones.

It is these unanticipated and sudden shocks from extreme weather events on global trade that are most disruptive for society; gradual changes can be foreseen and are easier to adapt to. Sitting in a bathtub with the tap running it is easy to stop the floor getting wet as the water rises by placing a few towels (up to a point). But the effect of climate change is like throwing rocks into the water. Our interlinked societies, the dynamics of which we are only beginning to understand, are like dominos lined up on the edge of the tub. One wave can make them all tumble.

Nature special: Outlook for Earth

As protests in Brazil, Turkey and Greece in recent years have shown, societies do not have to be brought to the verge of starvation to descend into turmoil. Communities respond to events in unforeseen ways. The triggers might be small and the reactions cannot be understood with equilibrium economic theory3. With the fragility of our globalized economy becoming more evident, it is time to readjust our focus.

The influence of climate change on the worldwide flows of materials, electricity, communications and energy, including interactions between them and the rapid dynamics of volatile markets, needs to be modelled and understood. As a first step, we must collect and share basic data on global supply chains.

To this end, my colleagues and I at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany have set up a website called Zeean (www.zeean.net) to host such information and to help to kick-start a community effort to understand and model it. By making these economic data available, governments and companies will be alerted to crucial bottlenecks in supply chains and can respond accordingly. Factoring in the costs of climate change will, we anticipate, allow market forces to help to stabilize the global supply network and make societies more resilient.

Sudden shocks

Almost all adaptation research so far focuses on local or regional responses to gradual changes in climate. This perspective has steered climate-change concerns towards long-term threats to fragile ecosystems and poor rural communities, which could be lessened through targeted strategies, such as altering crop production in the face of shifting monsoons in India, for example. Meanwhile, global trade connections and dramatic weather events are colliding — with even more costly consequences.

Thailand's devastating 2011 floods destroyed the country's automobile industry. And by disrupting manufacturing of mainly Japanese technology companies based in Thailand, the floods also caused a global shortage of hard-disk drives. With more than US$46 billion in damage4, the floods were ranked as the fourth-costliest disaster ever by the World Bank. But that does not include secondary losses from missing means of production.

Disruption to pharmaceutical supply networks is already having deadly consequences. The increasingly complex supply chains for drugs are highly susceptible to blockages, causing shortages of medicines. In 2011, global supplies of cancer and AIDS medications ran short after a failed hygiene inspection of one US manufacturer (see go.nature.com/qhgfg5). Extreme weather events compound those risks. “Resting on old standards — even ones that have worked for decades — is no longer enough,” cautioned Robert Parkinson, president of the US pharmaceutical company Baxter, addressing a US congressional subcommittee in 2008.

Bouts of severe weather in quick succession are even harder to recover from. Pakistan, for example, is still suffering from devastating monsoon-induced floods in 2010 and 2011. If hurricanes Sandy and Katrina had hit the US seaboard in the same season as last year's drought, even the United States might have struggled to cope.

Knock-on effects

A simple calculation of economic flow disruption illustrates how the global repercussions of weather disruptions to supply chains are likely to eventually exceed the direct damages. On the basis of data collected by Manfred Lenzen, a professor of sustainability research at the University of Sydney, Australia, and his colleagues5, we estimate that if not replaced, the cessation of exports from the Philippines, for example from fisheries and agriculture, would affect 6% of US production directly (see 'Global adaptive pressures'). The potential secondary effect, mainly through the retail trade, would be larger and could affect 21% of US production. The Philippines are globally the largest exporter of coconut oil, which is used in food products worldwide. For major economies such as Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, mounting impacts on sectors such as food production might greatly exceed the direct one.

Adaptation, like mitigation, needs to be global, but that does not mean it must be coordinated or regulated. Because the main aim of adaptation is to avoid damage, market forces might be effective in transferring costs. Just as the costs of insurance and meeting local safety requirements are factored into the prices of goods today, the costs of protecting supply chains from natural hazards can be included — if the information is available.

In many cases it will turn out that a diverse but reliable supply net is more favourable than relying on one source, even if that transportation route seems cheaper at first sight.

Lenzen's group has pioneered the application of supply-chain data to climate and sustainability problems5. They have compiled a database covering 26 industrial sectors in more than 180 countries, including, for example, the quantity of Australian coal used by the German steel industry and how much German steel is used in Russian ship building and Japanese car fabrication.

Collect data

Building on Lenzen's data, we plan for Zeean to eventually cover 400 sectors and individual states, provinces and cities, allowing users to track the flows of specific goods at a scale appropriate for the effects of natural disasters. Users could ask, for example, how many batteries are shipped from Osaka, Japan, to California. Or what is the impact of a hurricane in Boston, Massachusetts, or a flood in Bangalore, India, on particular industries worldwide?

In some cases, this supply-chain information is publicly available, but scattered around. In other cases, it must be deduced from import and export figures provided by national statistical agencies or government and industry bodies.

We intend the information posted to Zeean to be cross-checked and validated by registered and vetted users who will be assessed according to the quality of their input, in a similar way to websites such as Wikipedia. Single pieces of data, such as the number of cars produced in a region of Germany, for example, may be entered, as well as whole data sets, such as the 400-sector trade input–output matrices for Australia and Japan.

With the wrong focus, we will protect the wrong places with the wrong tools.

The information will need to be checked by comparing data from different sources or through consistency calculations. The sum of all individual flows out of a region should not exceed its total export, for example. Unlike in earlier approaches, we will not harmonize the information within a single global matrix, but will use the existing international data structures that comprise large economic sectors, and apply consistency tests to finer data where we can. This will avoid the introduction of artefacts, such as small unrealistic flows, to bridge data gaps and make computations feasible.

The processed information will be publicly available, so that small businesses and poor countries can use it. Only openly available data will be included, to avoid legal and rights issues. Open-source algorithms and analysis tools will be used for accessibility. Funding to maintain the database is being sought.

Understanding risk

With each piece of information added, Zeean will improve in accuracy. Users will be able to see a network evolving, analyse its connectivity and identify fragile links or nodes. By accommodating a variety of data, which need not be homogeneous, the database will allow for regional and economic foci of special interest.

Longer term, to produce supply-chain risk assessments, these economic data should be combined with probability assessments of future climatic extremes from global and regional climate models, as well as models of smaller-scale phenomena such as hurricanes6 or tornadoes. Other natural-hazard models might be included.

Understanding the global economic network is a huge challenge. The harmonization and cross-checking of the information will require constant effort, and some inconsistencies between data on different scales will be unavoidable. At the same time, the more information that is added, the better the network will get.",,2011 Thailand floods,Thailand,2011-07-12,2011-10-01,"['Bangkok', 'Phuket', 'Chiang Mai', 'Nakhon Ratchasima', 'Songkhla', 'Pattaya', 'Udon Thani', 'Khon Kaen', 'Nakhon Si Thammarat', 'Surat Thani', 'Phang Nga', 'Krabi', 'Chon Buri', 'Rayong', 'Trat', 'Chachoengsao', 'Prachin Buri', 'Nakhon Nayok', 'Saraburi', 'Suphan Buri', 'Uthai Thani', 'Lop Buri', 'Ang Thong', 'Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya', 'Saranyao', 'Pathum Thani', 'Nonthaburi', 'Samut Prakan', 'Samut Sakhon', 'Samut Songkhram', 'Ratchaburi', 'Kanchanaburi', 'Phetchaburi', 'Prachuap Khiri Khan', 'Chumphon', 'Ranong', 'Phang Nga', 'Krabi', 'Nakhon Si Thammarat', 'Surat Thani', 'Phuket', 'Songkhla', 'Pattaya', 'Udon Thani', 'Khon Kaen', 'Nakhon Si Thammarat', 'Surat Thani', 'Phang Nga', 'Krabi', 'Chon Buri', 'Rayong', 'Trat', 'Chachoengsao', 'Prachin Buri', 'Nakhon Nayok', 'Saraburi', 'Suphan Buri', 'Uthai Thani', 'Lop Buri', 'Ang Thong', 'Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya', 'Saranyao', 'Pathum Thani', 'Nonthaburi', 'Samut Prakan', 'Samut Sakhon', 'Samut Songkhram', 'Ratchaburi', 'Kanchanaburi', 'Phetchaburi', 'Prachuap Khiri Khan', 'Chumphon', 'Ranong']",1000 mm,US$46 billion,811,Destroyed the country's automobile industry.

On September 4, when they gathered at the house of Sukwinder Singh to join his baraat, no one imagined that his three-year-long love story with Jatinder Kour from nearby Laam would have such an end.

They had travelled barely 2 km from home when Sukwinder, 24, was dead and so were 63 others in his wedding procession, after their bus fell into the swollen Jhameerh nullah which falls en route.

Five days later, the hunt for the remaining 20 is still on, with local villagers forming groups to search the nullah waters from Jhameerh to Beri Pattan, right along the Line of Control (LoC). Carrying long bamboo sticks and ropes, they venture in and, at places, even dive under to ensure they don’t miss anything.

The bodies are being discovered by Army troops near the LoC even at Palanwalla in Akhnoor tehsil near Jammu, 65 km away, where these appear to have been washed up by the Chenab from the side of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). Since Sunday, troops of Akhnoor-based 10 Division have found three bodies, including that of one-and-a-half-year-old Harneet, on the Chenab banks.

The Jhameerh nullah merges with Nowshera nullah and flows into PoK from Beri Pattan in Rajouri district on the Indian side of the LoC. After nearly 1 km, it flows back to the Indian side to join the Chenab in Palanwalla area.

Daljit Singh, an ex-serviceman, has come to Nonial from Upper Nonial near Nowshera in search of his brother-in-law Manmohan Singh. “Let the body of someone’s relative be found, if not ours,” he says.

“Many families have been completely wiped out,” says Harbans Singh, a forest guard, adding that there is no household in the village which is not in mourning.

Sukhwinder, who worked as a daily wager with the Postal Department, and Jatinder, an 18-year-old college student, met three years ago. They both travelled to Nowshera every day and met on local matadors or buses. A year ago, their relationship became serious when both joined the same computer coaching institute at Nowshera. Their families were already related to each other, and a match was quickly arranged.

Sukhwinder had even begun construction of his own separate house to settle down after marriage. His father Bhagat Singh says the two decided everything about the place, right from the architecture and the colour of the walls to the putty on the ceilings and curtains, exchanging photographs on WhatsApp. “As she wanted a particular design for curtains, these were purchased from Rajouri, 45 km away,” Bhagat Singh says.

An inverter bought by Sukhwinder to install in the new house is yet to arrive because of the rains.

On September 4, the baraatis had waited for nearly three hours for the rains to stop, before over 200 of them decided to leave for Laam in three buses and some light motor vehicles around 11 am. Sukhwinder, along with his friends and some wedding material, was in the first car, says his elder brother Darbara Singh.

“On finding the Jhameerh in spate and water flowing over a bridge that falls en route, Sukhwinder came out of the car. His uncle and friends drove through and reached the other side of the nullah,” says Darbara.

Seeing them go through safely, the baraatis asked Sukhwinder to get into the bus just behind. However, he decided to wait for it to pass as well. When that too crossed safely, Sukhwinder got into the next bus. By then, this bus had over 70 people, as people travelling in their cars and two-wheelers had also boarded it because of the incessant rains.

The bus had reached the middle of the bridge when its front wheel, on the driver’s side, went into a deep crater and lost balance. The bus fell into the nullah. Those watching the bus jumped in and pulled out four people through the windows, while three others swam to safety on their own.

Armyman Rattan Singh had come home from Pathankot on September 3 night for the wedding. He along with his wife Amrit Kaur and daughter, Harneet, were among the dead. The body of his wife is still missing.

Another Army personnel, Swarn Singh, had come on five-day leave from Arunachal Pradesh for the marriage along with wife Ranbir Kaur and daughters Gurmeet, 3, and Tanya, who was just one-and-a-half month old. Ranbir and his daughters had got out of a car in which they were travelling to board the ill-fated bus. Now, Swarn is looking for their bodies.

The entire border road, including the bridge, is maintained by the General Reserve Engineer Force (GREF). “The crater had been there for the last few years, with local people drawing attention of GREF officials towards it from time to time, but to no avail,” says Harpreet Kaur. Since the accident, however, the crater has been filled up by the GREF.

Two days later, 13 bodies, including that of Sukhwinder, were pulled out of the bus, which was brought to the bank with the help of cranes by Army troops after water level in the nullah went down. Thirty-one others were found floating at different places, right up to Chammb-Jourian in Akhnoor near Jammu.

While police confirmed 64 deaths, villagers put the number between 70-80, saying that there was no count of infants and minor children sitting in their parents’ lap.

“The police, Army and local villagers have jointly formed groups to look for the bodies. The authorities across the LoC in PoK and Army troops of the Akhnoor-based 10 Division have been informed as well,” said Nowshera’s Additional SP Rakesh Kumar.

While the police have registered a case, they do not know whether to blame the driver — who is among the dead — or the GREF engineers for the negligence.

Congress legislator Ravinder Sharma says GREF engineers are responsible and a case should be registered against them.

None of the ministers from Chief Minister Omar Abdullah’s cabinet have visited the relatives of the victims so far. DCP Shantmanu and IGP Rajesh Kumar visited Rajpur Bhatta and announced Rs 1.5 lakh ex gratia relief from the state government for the relatives of the deceased.

Forest department officials and wildlife observers said the number is higher compared to years before, adding that spotting of seven Indian rock python during the same period reflected on widespread human encroachment on their habitat along city periphery.

Experts and forest officials said that flooding during monsoon, including the three-day long September city floods that covered a large swathe of areas along the Vishwamitri, Mahisagar and Dhadhar rivers under water affected the abode of reptiles, especially pythons that are generally found in bushes along the rivers as well as in green belt areas between Kalali and Por and those along Koile and Umetha villages on city’s western periphery.

“In three months alone, seven pythons were found from various parts of the city and from villages on city outskirts. They are coming in close contact with humans for two reasons: one, their own abode is getting disturbed due to large-scale construction activities going on in areas that were once covered with trees and bushes, and two, because of change in weather pattern that has caused humidity to stay for longer period,” said Arvind Pawar of Wildlife Rescue Trust.

Volunteers of the NGO Wildlife Rescue Trust rescued five pythons and a number of other snakes in the last few months. Construction activities along Dhadhar river near Vadodara led at least two pythons — each measuring 9.2 feet and 7.3 feet — move inside Itola village while yet another python was spotted inside a well near a temple at Vadsar village. Two pythons were rescued from city areas — each from Manjalpur and Atladra.

The forest department plans to study the movement pattern of the reptile that falls under schedule one of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, said DFO VK Saxena. “We plan to see their movement pattern and understand if they have shifted their base from one area to another,” he said.

As per data available with forest officials, as many as 340 rat snakes and 180 cobras were rescued from various residential societies in the last three months. Among venomous snakes, vipers were also rescued in large numbers, with the forest department putting their number at 101. A large variety of snakes such as banded racer, common kukri, common trinket, bronzeback, green killback, stripped killback, wolf snake, common sand boa and red sand boa were also rescued in different numbers from different places within the city.

Changing weather pattern this year has also given rise to incidents of snake spotting in human habitat. “High humidity drives snakes out of their habitat. Couple this with long monsoon and floods, and snakes will have no other options. Also, rising population of snakes and increasing construction activity will cause the increase of such instances,” said Snehal Bhatt of NGO, Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Forest officials said that the number was high this year when compared to years before but attributed the rise in numbers to a more strict approach to rescue operations by NGOs which now require them to bring the reptiles to the rescue centre run by the forest department within 24 hours of operation and keep department officials in the loop while carrying out the activities.

“All wild animals rescued by the NGOs are required to be brought to the rescue centre and registered.

“It is a matter of relief that fear of a major high flood has been averted. Volume of water flowing down Mahanadi at Munduli stood at around 11 lakh cusec as against over 12 lakh cusec anticipated earlier,” he said.

The level in Hirakud reservoir stood at 628.08 ft as against its full capacity of 630 ft and 50 of the 64 sluice gates were opened for discharge of excess water, said Biswajit Mohanty, Chief Engineer of Hirakud dam.

However, as flow of water into the river went down, it has been decided to first close three gates and subsequently more gates after assessing the situation, he said, adding flow into the reservoir from upper catchment areas was now around 7.8 lakh cusec.

As river Mahanadi and its tributaries were flowing above the danger level at several places including Naraj, Jobra and Daleighai, flood water submerged many areas where relief and rescue operation was intensified.

Many parts of Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Khurda and Puri districts were hit by flood in Mahanadi, even as situation in Jajpur and Bhadrak districts continued to be grave due to submergence of vast areas by flood in Baitarani though water level in the river is slowly falling, the SRC said.

As many as 9.95 lakh people in 1,553 villages of 89 blocks in 23 districts have so far been affected due to the floods, the SRC said, adding around 26 small breaches took places causing inundation of vast areas.

Steps would be taken to repair the breaches soon after the water recedes, he said.

Around 1.11 lakh people have been evacuated from low-lying areas to safe places and about 240 kitchens were now operating to provide them free cooked food.

As many as 2,41,658 people were marooned in 398 villages as surging water of Baitarani and Mahanadi and their tributaries flooded vast areas in Jajpur, Bhadrak, Cuttack, Khurda, Nayagarh, Angul, Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur districts, he said.

Two helicopters of the Indian Air Force have been kept on stand-by for use in relief operation, if necessary, the SRC said, adding at present the entire operation was being carried out with the help of boats.



Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday called up Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and pledged all necessary assistance in relief operations in flood-hit areas.

About a dozen NDRF teams have been mobilised in Keonjhar, Jajpur, Bhadrak, Balasore, Mayurbhanj, Cuttack, Kendrapara and Puri districts to assist in rescue and relief operation. Over 184 boats were engaged in the operation.

Around 30 units of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) were also deployed in vulnerable areas, SRC office said, adding fire brigade personnel were put on stand by.

In Jagatsinghpur, the focus was on relief work as around 20,000 people were marooned while about 7,000 persons have been evacuated, District Collector S K Mallick said, adding areas like Tirtol and Kunajang were affected.

In Puri district, water level in rivers like Bhargavi and Kushabhadra had risen inundating several villages in Nimapara, Kanas, Delang and Gop, while road link between Pipili and Nimapara was snapped, SRC office said.

Mohapatra said now there is no threat of any major breach in the river system.

As districts like Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Puri, Buodh, Khurda and Nayagarh are likely to be affected due to flood in Mahanadi river system, concerned authorities have been asked to take preparatory measures, he said, adding water level in rivers like Baitarani and Salandi are receding.

The flood situation in Brahmani and Subarnarekha rivers was also under control, he said.

Floods in Baitarani have affected around 1,52,721 people in Jajpur district where over 5,500 people have been evacuated to relief centres from marooned villages.

The SRC office said there were some small breaches in Baitarani river system in Jajpur district which have caused flooding in Jajpur, Korei and Dasarathpur blocks. Water would soon recede from submerged areas, it said.

A total of 156 villages were affected and 26 villages marooned due to the inundation in the three blocks.

A report from Kendrapara said road link in Rajkanika block in Kendrapara block was affected as floodwater of Kharasrota was flowing on Cuttack-Chandbali road at Ganjaghati under Aul block.

Similarly, three panchayats of Marsaghai and Derabis blocks in Kendrapara district were surrounded by flood water of Karandia river following a breach in the river embankment at Basapur, it said.",flood,2019 Odisha floods,"Odisha, India",17 June 2019,20 June 2019,"9.95 lakh people in 1,553 villages of 89 blocks in 23 districts",around 11 lakh cusec,26 small breaches took places causing inundation of vast areas,34,"2,41,658 people were marooned in 398 villages","Two helicopters of the Indian Air Force have been kept on stand-by for use in relief operation, if necessary",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Waseem Raja’s journey has been possible only after he saved a large number of people during the recent floods in the Valley.

Raja, 30, a resident of Barbarshah neighbourhood in the old city has won Rs 25 lakh after he was selected for a KBC’s special segment Hoslaybaaz (The Courageous) – a special segment for the people who have shown exemplary courage.

On September 6, Raja was busy in a musical show on the night when one of his band members received a call from his home that water has started entering into his house. All of the sudden they packed their instruments and reached the house of Zubair – a band members – in Shaheedgunj in Srinagar and rescued his family.

At 3.30 am on the same night, they heard another sad news – this time from the family of another band member Amir Ahmad who had been shifted to a hospital after he was electrocuted. They rushed to the hospital and spent the night there.

A day later as the city was deluged, Raja again rushed to Shaheedgunj. Raja, his friends and local police officer started the first rescue operation in the area. And while he was rescuing the trapped people in the area, he receive another call – this time from his own family informing him that waters had entered into their two storey house. He immediately went to home, rescued his family and kept them in the nearby mosque. He rushed back the Shaheedgunj to join the rescue operation.

Till September 12, Raja who rescued thousands of people including a Pakistani family which had come to visit their relatives in Srinagar. “It was a tough job. Even as we rescued trapped people, we helped them take out some important belongings from their houses,” he said.

After Raja’s brave efforts appeared in the local newspapers, he received a call from Sony television to enquire about his rescue efforts during the floods. “I was not expecting the call from the channel,” he said. “They asked me about my family and how I saved people during the flood. Perhaps they came to know about me through the newspapers.”

The a crew from Sony arrived in Srinagar to talk to people about Raja’s bravery effort in the floods. “After our crew visited valley to shoot the post flood devastation, we heard that Raja rescued more than 500 people in the floods and also saw his stories that appeared in the newspapers,” an official from the Sony Television said. “The programme is a segment of KBC where we select people who have done extraordinary in their lives.”

For Raja wining the KBC means more than Rs 25 lakh. “When I would watch the programme, sometimes it would come to mind that if I ever could play the game,” he said. “But then I would realize that I am a common man with no financial background and I would get out of my dream world.”

Today he is a proud Kashmiri. “I have made my parents proud and also Kashmir youth,” he said. “I will distribute this money to the flood affected victims in Kashmir.”

When the show was telecast on Thursday evening, he turned everyone emotional. And even Amitabh Bachan was all praise for Raja. “He appreciated me after the programme,” he said. “He has also written about me in the twitter and on the blog. It means a lot to me.”

Raja belongs to a poor family. For more than twenty years, his family lived in a shed on the banks of Dal Lake. He worked as a mechanic for four years and then through his saving he bought an auto rickshaw. He soon sold the auto to finance his sister’s marriage. “I then choose music as my profession and raised my own music band,” he said. “But the recent floods washed away my equipments and I now feel everything has been lost.”",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Most people do not want to stay in the valley for the night, lest they fall prey to the same fate of those who came here on June 16 last year.



Even the state government providing free food and accommodation is not reassuring enough to allay pilgrims’ fears. “Every one will get free accommodation. A sleeping bag will be given to all who spend the night here,” said Ashok Sonekar, a volunteer who has been staying here for the past several days to assist local officials.



After all, it was just a year ago when flash floods brought down millions of tonnes of boulders and muck from the surrounding hills, flattening almost everything in its path and killing thousands of people.



Locals believe that it will be long before Kedarnath returns to its former glory.



“It will take several years to restore the place. The government must also regulate construction here. No construction should be allowed around the shrine,” said a police official, who did not want to be named.



Not much has changed at ground zero. Even with the administration roping in hundreds of workers to remove boulders and clear the paths that lead to the shrine, visible signs of devastation still persist.



By covering some of the debris of destroyed houses, hotels and shops, the local administration has very unconvincingly tried to camouflage the destruction.



Boulders, some of which have skeletons of animals trapped under them, surround the shrine from all sides and glance at devotees almost menacingly.



Even the few sadhus who have been able to reach the shrine this season claim they have seen several human skeletons along the trekking route to the shrine. In the past few days, around three-dozen skeletons were found in the forests around Jungle Chatti, which line the path to the shrine. Officials are still combing the forests to look for more bodies. People, however, have still managed to find faith in these grim surroundings.



A few feet from the rear walls of the shrine is “Bhim Shila” – a large rock that came tumbling down from the hills during the floods.

The locals apparently wanted the NDRF men to concentrate on a particular area and when the force personnel decided to go to a different marooned area, the locals attacked them.

“The jawan has been sent to Chandigarh for treatment and was accommodated on a scheduled IAF flight going to that city. Few incidents of our men being heckled are being witnessed since yesterday in the state,” a senior officer said.

Worried by the development, the NDRF and senior Home Ministry officials have asked the Cabinet Secretary to devise some mechanism so that troops are kept safe while they render their duty.

“It has been decided that CRPF will guard rescue teams but we are still to find a way to implement this mechanism as there is limited space on the boat. Carrying security men on boat means reducing space for people to be rescued,” a senior official said.

Meanwhile, the government has rushed NDRF chief O P Singh to Srinagar to personally monitor and supervise rescue operations in the state.

[Jammu and Kashmir | Picking up the Pieces ]

SEPTEMBER 13, 2014

Close to 300 people died in a deluge of the kind that no one had ever seen in Jammu and Kashmir — or could see coming. Homes, buildings, orchards and businesses worth thousands of crores were destroyed. The scarring the state suffered contributed to the NC’s election defeat

Srinagar city was devastated in the September floods after the Jhelum river basin received an average of 303 mm of rain between the 3rd and 7th of that month, which was 562 per cent more than the normal monthly rainfall for the whole of September in the region.

To avoid similar flooding in the future, an expert committee has said, an additional channel must be constructed around Srinagar to carry the extra water of the Jhelum river.

The ‘flood spill channel’ will be in addition to an existing one, said the committee constituted by the Ministry of Water Resources to study the floods. The new channel would divert water in the Jhelum from just downstream of Sangam town, and carry it all the way to Wular lake, bypassing Srinagar. The proposal is on the lines of an old proposal by the Jammu and Kashmir government, and is likely to find favour with the state.

The expert committee — comprising Central Water Commission chairman A B Pandya, Indus Water Commissioner K Vohra and National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, director R D Singh — also recommended construction of small storage facilities on various tributaries of the Jhelum. These facilities could be used to generate power, and would also moderate the effect of flooding, if not prevent it altogether.

However, the committee pointed out, the storage would need to be built in compliance with the Indus Water Treaty with Pakistan, which allows construction of flood storage only up to a maximum of 0.75 million acre feet.

During September’s flood, the unusual rainfall had led to a flow of about 2,500 cubic metres per second or cumec (about 88,277 cubic feet per second or cusec) in the Jhelum at Sangam, about 50 km upstream of Srinagar. Just ahead of Srinagar, the peak flow was about 3,200 cumec.

Within the city, the Jhelum can safely carry only about 900 cumec.

The existing flood channel in Srinagar was built following the floods of 1903. It was designed to handle about 481 cumec, but can now carry only about 100 cumec.

With the river carrying water more than three times its capacity, almost all of Srinagar was inundated, the report said.

The report has made several other recommendations to be implemented in the immediate, short and long term. This includes closing of breaches before the next monsoon season, development of a flood forecasting and warning system, raising and strengthening of existing embankments, setting up of an emergency response mechanism, and floodplain zoning.",flood,2014 Kashmir Floods,"Jammu and Kashmir, India","September 3, 2014","September 7, 2014","Srinagar, Anantnag, Baramulla, Pulwama, Shopian, Kulgam, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Kupwara",303 mm,Thousands of crores,Close to 300,"Scarred the state, contributed to the NC's election defeat",,,,,,,,"Construction of an additional flood spill channel, construction of small storage facilities on various tributaries of the Jhelum, closing of breaches before the next monsoon season, development of a flood forecasting and warning system, raising and strengthening of existing embankments, setting up of an emergency response mechanism, and floodplain zoning",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The decision comes after J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi a few days ago seeking an in-depth study on whether an alternative channel for the Jhelum could be created to carry extra water during a flood.

Accordingly, an expert team under chairman of the Central Water Commission has been asked to assess the reasons for the flooding, and whether an alternative channel circling the town is technically and financially feasible.

The proposal to divert the Jhelum is not new, official sources said. It has been talked about in the state as a permanent solution to the flooding and water-logging that is regularly witnessed during the rainy season. It is estimated that Rs 8,500 crore would be required to create this channel. However, the proposal was never concrete enough to be included in formal discussions between the state government and the Centre during earlier meetings on flood control measures.

Officials, however, said that even if an additional channel to carry Jhelum water was in place, it could not have prevented the kind of flooding witnessed this year.

“This year was an unprecedented situation. There is little that can be done to avoid this kind of a situation,” CWC chairman Ashwin Pandya said.

Interestingly, till March this year, the Centre and the state government were discussing a Rs 2,000 crore plan to strengthen the embankments of the Jhelum, which gave in during heavy rainfall at the start of September. This was the primary reason for sudden flooding of Srinagar town, most of which lies lower than the river-bed of the Jhelum. The project was still to take a final shape and would have been carried out over the next few years. As an immediate step, however, Rs 100 crore was given to the state government to do emergency repair on the embankments, but it turned out to be a case of too little, too late.

The expert team under Pandya has now been instructed to conduct a comprehensive study of the Jhelum flood plain and explore every option — not just the option to create an alternative channel, which some experts consider not viable — to prevent a similar tragedy in the future. The team is likely to submit its report by October-end.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

They narrate how water started coming into residential areas, how quickly the levels rose and how each of them managed to escape the fury, some on their own, some with the help of the army and some with the help of locals.

“I, along with other three members of family, left our house on Sunday evening (August 31) when water level started rising fast. I arranged for a boat and first dispatched my daughter to the masjid.

They realised she was one of the thousands of survivors of the floods that ravaged Kashmir the previous month. But what really surprised them was the five-year-old’s answer when asked where she was from — Bandra in Mumbai, and separated from her parents for over a year.

Today, Megha is living with the Sheikhs, like their own daughter, hours away from reuniting with her family which has been traced in a slum. And giving a sinister twist to this story is the clear indication that she may have been a victim of child-trafficking.

“She is missing her family,” said Dilshada Bano, wife of Abdul Rashid Sheikh, adding that she has taken care of Megha like her own daughter Nifya. “During the initial days, she refused to eat food but now she is better. We are treating her like a family member,” she added.

To keep Megha occupied and happy, the Sheikhs have even taught her how to play games on Nifya’s iPad. But what has worried the family and police are Megha’s replies to questions about how she reached Kashmir.

Sitting with Nifya inside Sheikh’s home, Megha told The Indian Express in Hindi that she was brought to Kashmir on a train by a person she called Nazir who “took me to Sopore, Ashmuqam and Anantnag where he would beg for money from people.” \”He even cut my hair,” she said.

“He (Nazir) kidnaps small children from Mumbai. I went to Uttar Pradesh, Nizamuddin in Delhi, Jammu and then Kashmir,” she said, adding that Nazir didn’t give her food for days. Recalling her days in Mumbai, Megha said that her father “used to beat my mother after drinking alcohol.” “I miss my mother so much and I want to go back to my home now,” she said.

The Sheikhs initially informed the local Nehru Park police station about the child. “They told us to visit the Ram Munshi Bagh police station. But there, they refused to accept the child, saying that this station is only meant for women,” Dilshada Bano said.

Masood Rashid, Station House Officer (SHO) at Nehru Park, said that it was they who alerted police in Mumbai.

According to Rakesh Maria, Police Commissioner, Mumbai, “We got the information (from police in Srinagar) and the missing persons bureau was put into action. In two hours, the details were matched. The family lives in Nirmal Nagar and had registered her as missing a year ago. The family is now being taken to Kashmir by our team which will ensure they are reunited with the child.”

According to Vasant Dhoble, ACP in Mumbai police’s Missing Persons Bureau, they found at least 13 Meghas initially and the search was narrowed down only because the child could remember where she lived. “Nirmal Nagar is a huge slum pocket. We sent teams to track her hut and they showed people prints of her photograph doing the rounds in social media. They confirmed the identity of the girl,” said Dhoble.

Police records have identified Megha’s father as Shardaprasad Chaudhury and her mother as Seema. According to them, Megha was walking with her mother when she asked Seema to get her something to eat from a roadside eatery. “Her mother paid for the food and had begun walking. When she turned back after a minute, the child was gone. This was in June 2013.”

In fact, it was a member of the Sheikh family, Parvaiz, a tour operator, who first posted Megha’s photo on Facebook.

Bashir Ahmad, Abdul Rashid Sheikh’s brother, said that the family is doing everything to keep Megha happy. “In the evenings when we watch the news, she comes and wants to switch the channel to Cartoon Network. We immediately change the channel so that she can watch the Doremon cartoons,” he said.

Now that UIDAI chairman and former Infosys CEO Nandan Nilekani has decided to take the political plunge, Pai has welcomed the decision of his good friend but has also been critical of his contribution to the Bangalore South constituency. Pai assesses the evolving political situation in an email interview:

The BPac has been stressing the need for a candidate to have strong credentials for good, consistent work in the constituency he is contesting from.

Strong credentials are needed as expectation and need are high. Credentials bring in acceptance, trust, belief in democracy, ability to influence officials and endure results.

In the Karnataka assembly polls, BPac helped fund candidates who fell in the young and promising category. Does BPac intend to support candidates in the Lok Sabha polls too?

Yes, on the same basis.

What is your view on the emergence of the Aam Aadmi Party?

It is a good development as citizens now have an alternative. Also they will put pressure on the system to reform areas such as elections, police, improve governance and response to citizens. The gap between citizens and government is very wide today.

While welcoming the possible entry of Nandan Nilekani in politics as being good for the country, you have been critical on his contributions to the Bangalore South constituency where he aspires to contest the parliament polls from. Why is this?

I am not personally critical and fully support his candidature. I was voicing the opinion of many citizens who spoke to me after his candidature was announced, and who are apprehensive that a candidate not from the grassroots or attached to the constituency will tend to ignore the constituency. We have seen the current MP getting more engaged in party work and work in Delhi and not spending enough time in the constituency. Many people are disappointed. All over the world MPs work hard to meet the aspirations of their constituency, represent their views in the legislature, raise issues which are germane to them, bring in investment in the constituency, etc. This can happen mostly when the candidate has worked locally, developed a connect with voters, understands their needs and issues and becomes their champion. As today there are many central schemes, it is essential the MP works with the state government and the local MLAs to get investment into the constituency for local needs such as transport, water, sewage, jobs.

Does the entry of a possibly good leader in the political fray on a established party’s ticket and his resorting to old electoral practices set the clock back on grooming new leaders?

Well, hopefully, a good leader will remain good and make a better impact.

Do you believe good candidates alone can trump the influence of caste and money in politics?

Yes, because they can transcend caste and money. For instance, Nandan will be able to get above caste and money and hopefully make a better impact.

How difficult in your opinion is it for an ordinary citizen, without strong political and financial backing or an identity-based constituency, to contest polls in an urban area like Bangalore?

Very difficult, unless a phenomenon like AAP happens or the ordinary citizen has done good work in the constituency and gained the trust of voters.",discussion,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The study will focus on how farmers are coping with irregular monsoon, frequent droughts and floods - some of the impacts of climate change.The 18-month study, funded by the South Asian Network for Development and Environmental Economics (SANDEE) will be carried out by researchers from Bangalore-based Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) and Azim Premji University (APU).""Climate change is a slow process, the true impacts of which are difficult to understand. Studying farmers who are now facing water shortage will give us an idea as to how they are likely to adapt to climate change,"" said Allwin Jesudasan, principal investigator of the project.The study area has been fixed as Manimutharu irrigation area depending on Manimutharu dam for water to cultivate. In the last three to four years water has not been released in the 80ft channel while it was released in the 40ft channel regularly.Hence, a situation arose wherein one set of villages received water while the remaining experienced a drought-like situation. Since there is no adequate rainfall in the region for water to flow in both channels, researchers are using this as an opportunity to understand how farmers are coping with water shortage on these two parameters arising in same area, said M Mathivanan, a researcher from ATREE.Recently, an inception workshop for local stakeholders such as farmers and panchayat officials of Manimutharu region was organised at Agasthyamalai-based Community Conservation Centre (ACCC) of ATREE where Seema Purushotomman, professor, APU and Soubadra Devy, scientist from ATREE moderated the discussion with the farmers. Several farmers said that the one of the primary impacts of water shortage was temporary migration. Some farmers even mentioned that because of temporary migration instances of AIDS in the villages have increased.In addition, there seems to be difference between how rich and poor farmers are adapting. For example, rich farmers could afford to spend on drilling a borewell. Increased reliance on non-agricultural occupation was another coping mechanism of farmers.

478,1556,bangalore,2014,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/gone-under/,14 Sept 2014,The Sunday Story: Gone Under,"One night, after water had started flowing into a few low-lying Srinagar neighbourhoods, Chief Minister Omar Abdullah made a round of the city and personally monitored the rescue of a toddler.

However, once the city had actually gone down under by Saturday night, ministers, bureaucrats and police officers were among those trapped inside their residences. DGP K Rajindra and IGP, Kashmir, Abdul Gani Mir were forced to operate for long in the same pair of uniform as they didn’t have a dry pair at home to change into. The state police were reduced to merely carrying relief materials and loading these onto Air Force planes headed for sorties.

Two of Omar’s senior ministers were rescued from Tulsibagh. Senior officials had to be saved and shifted to relief camps. Several of them left for Jammu soon after, where they have another set of official homes.

After the floods, only four of the city’s more than two dozen police stations remained working. Water entered wireless sets and left them useless, shutting down another line of communication in a city where cellular services were down till Friday and are still erratic.

In Bemina neighbourhood, rescue was conducted by local volunteers using makeshift rafts made of foam mattresses.

In an interview to a TV channel, Omar, who is staring at even bleaker prospects in the coming Assembly elections, tried to earn some sympathy. He himself “had no government for the first 24 hours”, he said, noting that there was a complete breakdown between him and his officials initially.

In a flooded city where hundreds still remain missing and many set off every hour desperately looking for them, if there are a few people who have gone into hiding, they are the top government faces.

Occasionally, they resurface on TV screens to drop a few sacks of flour from a military chopper or to give sound bites, but in submerged Srinagar, that’s adding insult to injury.

The missing government remains the story of this tragedy.

In 2009, the J&K chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) had predicted widespread devastation due to natural disasters in the Valley, and the Omar government had accepted its recommendations. Nothing came of it.

“We had observed that construction in the low-lying areas of Srinagar, especially along the banks of the Jhelum, had blocked the discharge channels of the river,” says Saleem Beg, convener of INTACH, J&K.

The INTACH report also observed that the Jhelum bund — first built by Dogra ruler Pratap Singh over a century ago, to keep bungalows safe from floods — had been concretised and encroached upon. “The authorities thought concrete would stop the flood, but it only caused more flooding. They should have dredged the Jhelum because its current outflow is wrong,” Beg says, though he admits that flooding may have been inevitable this time because of the amount of rainfall received.

In 2010, a paper prepared by the J&K Flood Control Department predicted a major flood that would inundate Srinagar. The government ignored it too because the minister overseeing the department had his constituency in Jammu and considered the prediction of a flood in Jhelum alarmist.

The Jhelum wreaked havoc for six days this time as it meandered its way across south Kashmir, before reaching Srinagar, but the government delayed in reacting. Three days before Srinagar was flooded, the waters at Sangam near Anantnag had risen so high that the Flood Control Department couldn’t find its gauge.

While the inundation of Srinagar perhaps couldn’t have been halted, the breach in embankments could have been prevented. But even that didn’t happen.

With the waters receding now, the Omar government has a chance to put these floods behind it the Assembly elections. The first step could be ending the information blackout. The government needs to provide all the information available about what happened inside submerged neighbourhoods.

Similarly, despite assurances from telecom operators that communication will be restored soon, they have only been able to restore limited connectivity in a few pockets of Srinagar. Radio Kashmir is the only communication link available. Dedicated broadcasters are running round-the-clock live progammes on the channel, informing people about the flood situation in various areas of the city and helping them link up with friends and families.

While the focus of the rescue and relief operations is Srinagar, there is an urgent need to intervene in South Kashmir as well as Jammu province. People there are hungry and without any clean drinking water.

The government as well as the private healthcare system in Srinagar has collapsed. All the major hospitals are either submerged or disconnected because patients cannot reach them. Director, Health Services, Kashmir, Saleem-ur-Rehman who had lost all communication with his colleagues and the administration for several days, says most of the medical supplies stores and godowns are submerged or damaged.

The situation will get worse as there are reports of cholera and other communicable diseases from the submerged areas. A rescue team of volunteers who had gone to the villages of Bonpora, Chak and Kanihama on way to Pampore found dozens of people complaining of symptoms of cholera. These neighbourhoods had several poultry farms, and thousands of chicken now lie floating in water.

“The stench was unbearable, there was no water to drink,” says Muzaffar Ahmad, a volunteer who was part of the rescue and relief team.

Deep inside Batamaloo neighbourhood in Srinagar too, where carcasses of dogs and cattle have been floating around, there are reports of children being down with fever for the past few days.

The government also has to restore road links, especially the Srinagar-Jammu national highway, fast, with the supplies of essential commodities across Kashmir depleting.

Several educational institutions, medical centres and other government buildings that are submerged will take months to function again and the government will have to find alternatives. The restoration of electricity is also a major issue.

Plus, the government needs to prepare for winter right away, which may come earlier. There are several thousand people left homeless.

A man who had heard Omar speak at a recent rally said the CM’s focus was on bijli, sadak and paani while asking for votes. “Today, there is no bijli, sadak isn’t visible and the water has drowned his government for good,” he said.

There is a saving grace though: the chance that the elections may be put off.

479,1557,bangalore,2014,https://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/mango-moods/article5891921.ece,9 Apr 2014,Mango moods,"April 09, 2014 06:25 pm | Updated May 21, 2016 09:58 am IST - kochi:

Summer always smells like mangoes — a sweet, sticky smell that floods the markets by mid March. The smell that formally declares the arrival of vacations, sweltering days and pickled childhood memories. In the middle of another mango season, business is ripening in Kerala and menus, sweetening.

Alphonso is the queen this season, too, because it is the sweetest, says Vijayan, a sales person at the fruit stall at Panampilly Nagar. “It is the most loved for its taste,” he says, pointing at the heap of blushing fruit with a taut, golden yellow skin. At Rs. 160 a kilo, the Alphonso is one of the more expensive varieties. But as the season wanes, the prices will fall and towards rains, they would come at remarkably moderate rates.

Kerala’s own Chandrakkaran, the bite-sized green variety, too is available in plenty. At Rs. 140 a kilo, they are far from cheap, says Sheeja, who runs a stall on the Kaloor-Kadavanthra road. Except for a scatter of pomegranates, her cart is dominated by mangoes. “Prices are not a problem these days. People are willing to spend money on seasonal fruits. Increasing health awareness could be one of the main reasons,” she says. Though most of the varieties she sells are cultivated in Kerala, hers come from Bangalore. “They are fresher… I think.”

The bigger retail chains display their bounty in a more organised manner with little blackboards announcing the names of the varieties with the price.

Alphonso and Chandrakkaran are closely followed by Priyoor (Rs. 120), Banganapalli (Rs. 110), Thamboor (Rs. 100), Sindhoori (Rs. 99) and Moovandan and Urmani at Rs. 80. The Totapuri or the Kilimooku is the least expensive at Rs. 65 a kilo.

Many of the mangoes in the market are cultivated in Kerala. However, some varieties such as Banganapalli and Sindoori come from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

Each variety has its own standout features in terms of colour, texture and flavour. Each is relished in a differnt way. In Kerala, for instance, the Chandrakkaran is used for making pulissery and the Moovandan variety is generally savoured with salt and spices.

Though courtyards may have shrunk and fewer households have their own dear mango tree, Malayalis do not compromise on their summer menus, which still happily revolve around the mango. “It is the most versatile fruit, if you ask me. There are just so many things you can do with it,” says homemaker Radha S.

She explains: “Tiny, tender mangoes (kanni manga) in brine is one of the most basic, but best appreciated nibbles. Even children love it. With slightly bigger mangoes, one can make a simple pickle. Sundried mangoes, sometimes mixed in jaggery, can even be eaten as dessert. These stay up to a year,” Radha says. Her list doesn’t end there. Chutneys, avial, sambar, juices, payasam and even a spinach dish are part of her repertoire.

Mangoes almost always smell of childhood. Artist and writer Bara Bhaskaran still fondly remembers the gigantic mango tree that stood upright in the courtyard of his ancestral house at Mangad in Kasaragod district. “The tree was extraordinarily tall and its canopy resembled a dark cloud. The women of the house boiled water under its shade, perhaps why the leaves took on an ominous black hue. In my memory, the tree has borne fruit just once and the mangoes were as big as coconuts. The whole house smelt of mangoes,” he says. Coming from a “mango belt”, he says the fruit occupies an integral place in the cuisine of the area. One of his favourites is the green mango, which is cooked with dried prawns and jackfruit seeds. “It is usually made during the early monsoon, from mangoes left over by the summer,” he says.

Before the digital age, the trees and fruit provided immense entertainment for children, too. “We used to make lion’s heads out of seeds and have numerous mango felling competitions. Also, the trees were perfect hiding places,” Bhaskaran recalls.

When Nature is showering mangoes upon us, why not feast on them? “There is one school of thought that says mangoes generate heat and are not ideal for everyone. But I recommend seasonal fruits. Mangoes are nutrient-rich. While raw mango has Vitamin C, the ripe ones are loaded with beta-carotene,” says consultant nutritionist Gayathri Ashokan.

The question then is would you eat it raw, sweet, spicy, dried, pickled, curried or cooked this summer?",discussion,Kerala Mango Season,Kerala,March,June,Kerala,Heavy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe
480,1558,bangalore,2014,https://www.livemint.com/Politics/3Ex8iN0xErnoeXcnQ48eZM/Spatial-poverty-in-Karnataka.html,3 Nov 2014,Spatial poverty in Karnataka,"Karnataka accounts for about 6% of India’s national income. The state’s strong industrial base, rich mineral resources towards the north and an extremely vibrant information technology (IT) sector have made it one of India’s leading investment destinations.

However, growth has been lopsided and concentrated in only a few locations; about one-third of the state’s income comes just from Bengaluru district. Moreover, the benefits of growth have not percolated to all sections of the population and the Tendulkar committee poverty estimates show Karnataka as having the highest level of poverty among the southern Indian states.

Rapid growth of the IT sector and integration of Karnataka with the global economy have opened up a large array of opportunities for the people in the state. Moreover, the agriculture sector has also seen improvement, especially in the cash crops segments. These have paved the way for large multinational companies and corporate houses to set up operations in the state. However, much of this expansion and, especially that of the IT sector, still remains restricted to a few locations.

Our spatial analysis suggests stark inequality in terms of economic opportunities available within the state. So, while there is a comparatively low poverty rate in the IT-developed districts, like Bangalore, Mysuru and Udupi, small pockets of high poverty are seen within these districts also. At the same time, mineral-rich northern Karnataka has among the highest poverty rates, some not very different from those observed in northern and eastern India.

We find that proximity to mines shows up as an important correlate of poverty. Karnataka is known for its rich mineral resources, and the mineral belt covers an area of 1.92 lakh sq. km. These are not new discoveries and have been known for some time, and have even contributed to the manufacturing investment in the state. Yet, these same areas, namely the rich mining districts as Ballari, Kolar, Hosapete, Bagalkot and Chitradurga show inordinately high levels of spatial poverty.

This high-poverty mining versus low-poverty IT sector is among the most curious aspects of development in Karnataka. It is well known that the IT sector is unable to directly benefit the large masses of the less educated and underprivileged people of India. A sector like mining, on the other hand, can readily provide employment to thousands of uneducated and underskilled people. One would have expected that poverty should be less visible around mining establishments. But spatial analysis proves otherwise. What could be the reason?

On the one hand, mining areas do tend to have a significant inflow of unskilled labour from within Karnataka as well as from other states. Their lives remain dependent on the condition of the mines. The illegal mining scam that was uncovered by the Karnataka Lokayukta in its 2011 report which resulted in the closure of a large number of mines adversely affected the lives of people in these areas. However, at the same time, it is well known that the conditions of workers in the mining sector have for decades been relatively stagnant and close to subsistence levels, not just in Karnataka, but across most of the country.

The link between poverty and historically marginalized groups—Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes—is a standard story across all states. Despite the constitutional privileges given to the minority groups, a large section continues to remain in severe poverty. Group dominance plays an important role in participation in growth and distribution and improving the level of living. It has been seen that the benefits of economic growth have always taken time to reach the marginalized group. A large proportion of this segment lies in the western and northern parts of the state where poverty is more endemic.

Our spatial analysis shows a strong link between poverty and barren land. These areas have significant problems of harsh environment and economic hardship. Another major challenge facing the agriculture sector in Karnataka is mainstreaming the vast drought-prone/rain-fed areas. The presence of rain-fed regions, compounded by frequent climatic aberrations of floods and droughts, has often pushed families in the agriculturally-rich zone to severe poverty.

Our concept of spatial poverty that can be identified and measured via remote sensing allows us a far greater set of policy insights, as it allows relating poverty to the environment that gives rise to and sustains it.

481,1559,bangalore,2014,https://www.deccanherald.com/features/bullock-cart-promoting-sapling-plantation-2221075,25 Oct 2014,Bullock cart for promoting sapling plantation drive,"After sometime, the passersby realised that the unique roadshow was a special campaign called “Sagada Gadi” (bullock cart), launched by Bakul Foundation, a city-based NGO. The campaign was a part of “My Tree”, another larger annual event organised in Bhubaneswar by the Bakul for the last few years to encourage the people to go for sapling plantation to protect the environment.



“The Sagada Gadi campaign was a grand success as the people not only thronged to see the well-decoratedbullock cart but also were extremely keen to take the saplings home,” said Sweta Dash, a Bakul volunteer, who coordinated the eye-catching road show.



The 22-year-old girl, who is all set to join as a content writer in a Bangalore-based firm, said the campaign was successful as 500-odd saplings, which were to be distributed, were over within a couple of hours of launching the campa­ign. “After we ran out of stock, many people came and enquired if they can get the saplings from our office,” she said.



The campaign was also a great experience for the 25-odd Bakul volunteers, most of them students of different educational institutions in and around Bhubaneswar. “The experience of riding a bullock cart that too for a noble initiative was certainly a memorable one,” said Prayash Mohapatra (19), an information technology student in an engineering college who was one among the volunteers in charge of decorating the bullock cart.



Sujit Mahapatra, the chief of Bakul Foundation, said the reason behind using the bullock cart was to attract people for an important and extremely essential initiative like sapling-plantation with the help of a pollution-free and eco-friendly cart which has become a rarity in towns and cities.



“On the first anniversary of our progra­mme we had distributed saplings from roadside. However, subsequently we deci­ded to go for a roadshow to attract more people. Initially, we had thought of using a motor vehicle. But eventually we opted for the bullock cart as it is rarely seen in the towns and cities nowadays. Moreover, the bullock cart is eco-friendly and never creates pollution like the motor vehicles,” the activist said.



On “My Tree”, Mahapatra said the programme was primarily aimed at establishing a direct connect and a permanent relationship between a tree and an individual. “Through the programme we encourage people to plant a sapling and develop a relationship with it for its growth and survival,” said the Bakul chief.



He stressed the urgent need for large-scale tree plantation and said it has become extremely essential for the protection of environment and ecology.



“Deforestation is happening across the globe at the rate of 13 million hectares every year. Every second, a rainforest area of the size of a football field is being destroyed. To make up for the loss of trees in the past one decade, each individual needs to plant and take care of at least two saplings a year,” Mahapatra said . There is an immediate need for large-scale sapling plantation in a state like Odisha which had already been experiencing natural disasters like floods and cyclones almost every year.



Mindless deforestation



Many environmentalists attribute the catastrophes at frequent intervals to mindless deforestation in Odisha’s coastal areas.



The Bakul’s efforts seem to have borne fruit as many individuals have started planting saplings regularly with the help of the NGO. “I know a teacher who takes saplings from us regularly and plants them in different places in Bhubaneswar as well as in the neighbouring town of Khurda. He also takes care of them and ensures their survival,” Mahapatra said.



The NGO also encourages people to use saplings as a gift on special occasions like marriages, birthdays and house warming ceremonies.



“While attending a marriage reception if you present a sapling to the newly-wed couple instead of regular gifts, it will definitely attract the attention of the people. There is a fair chance that at least some present at the wedding would get inspi­red and do the same when he or she attends a social function next time,” said the Bakul chief.



To create more awareness among the common man about sapling plantation and environment, the NGO also organises another programme which has been christened as “travelling film festival on environment”.



“Our volunteers get in touch with societies of different apartments, schools and colleges and organise shows of short films and documentaries on environment and sapling plantation. We have already organised many such shows in the state capital. The shows have been a great hit, particularly among youngsters and children,” Mahapatra claimed.

Transportation was affected in the area for more than 12 hours as the increased water level caused inundation of the approach road to the temple.However, the flood-like situation which may affect the common, is a casual affair the pilgrims who flock in large numbers from far and wide with deep devotion. For centuries, tribals have been assembling here, feeling blessed after a holy dip in the sacred waters. For them, it is a bigger ‘tirtha’ than Pushkar, Prayag or Kashi itself. This is why Beneshwar is considered to be the Pushkar of Vagad and the fair held each year in January is referred to as the ‘Maha Kumbha’ of the Vanvasis’.The problem of flooding further intensifies when the sluice gates of the Mahi dam are opened and the water gushes down with a full force, said Kamal Sharma a resident. Knee-deep water is a common scene for people here in rainy days.Many a times, the priests and workers have to stay back up to two-three days at a stretch when the approach road is submerged due to heavy water flow. “This is a routine here in times of heavy rain and we take full precautions to prevent any untoward incident in the area,” additional SP Mahavar Ganapati said. Police are deployed at both end of the approach road to prohibit entry during floods and at night, high intensity lights are used for extra security, he added.Sub-divisional magistrate S N Acharya said, “Since there is not much people residing in the area, the problem does not have effect at a mass level. However, a master plan has already been drafted for a permanent solution which was put up before the cabinet and ministers who came here during the recently concluded ‘Sarkar Apke Dwar’ program.”The Beneshwar Dham, is situated in a triangular piece of land. In Vagad dialect, an island is called ‘Ben’ and an ancient temple of lord Shiva is there, hence the name Beneshwar – lord of the island. The confluence of three rivers hold importance as the temple attracts with hundreds of people from the tribal community coming here to have the holy dip in the ‘Triveni Sangam’ and darshan at the temple.",flood,Beneshwar Dham Flood,"Dungarpur district, Rajasthan",2023-07-07,2023-07-08,['Beneshwar Dham'],['100 mm'],"['submerged approach road to the temple', 'knee-deep water in the area']",0,"['disruption in transportation', 'priests and workers had to stay back for 2-3 days']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

This move to delay complying with the listing regulations comes after the company’s subsidiary in Kenya has been in legal tangles with its banker in recent times.“The CFC Stanbic Bank Limited, Kenya, the banker of the subsidiary company has appointed receivers for the subsidiary company and on all the properties of the subsidiary in Kenya. Due to this issue, the company does not have any access to the accounts of its subsidiary in Kenya. In spite of several requests to the appointed receivers, the company has not received any inputs on the accounts of the company for year-ended March 31, 2014 till date. In these circumstances, it would be difficult for the company to prepare the consolidated accounts of its subsidiaries at this point of time,” Karuturi said in a regulatory disclosure.The company further added that the said subsidiary has transactions with other subsidiaries too due to which even other subsidiaries account finalisation is also not complete.“However, the company after failing to get the accounts of the Kenyan subsidiary from the receivers has approached the Kenyan High court seeking to compel the receivers/managers appointed by the CFC Stanbic Bank Ltd to provide the audited accounts of the company,” Karuturi added.This step by Karuturi to seek an extension comes after a series of issues it has been facing at its expansive roses farms in Kenya including delay of salaries to its workers there. Karuturi employed 4,000 workers and at its peak, exporting 1.5 million cut-roses per day to Europe. Its farm in Naivasha was home to 40 species of roses. The management of Karuturi Global was not available for their comments on Wednesday. The flagship roses exports business of Karuturi Global started to get into trouble after a winding-up petition filed by a packaging company which is part of the Aga Khan Development Network.Karuturi Global, which rose dramatically onto the global stage as among the leading rose exporters to Europe from Africa, is already in various stages of extricating itself from the issues over its ambitious agriculture foray in Ethiopia, which is facing backlash and is midst of various problems.Karuturi Global expanded its base in Africa by acquiring Kenya-based Sher Agencies in September 2007 from Dutch horticulturists Gerrit & Peter Barnhoorn. The acquisition brought into Karuturi’s fold a 188-hectare farmland in the rich Naivasha region of Kenya. Of this, about 135 hectares were under greenhouse cultivation and 42 hectares in open cultivation and has an average daily output of about 1.5 million stems that are exported from Kenya to Europe.These series of setback for Karuturi is compounding the problems for the company, which over the past four years, has been trying to establish an expansive agriculture exports business in Ethiopia. It had embarked on an ambitious $300 million agriculture foray in Ethiopia by growing a range of cereals and plantation crops in which it suffered a severe setback in late 2011 due to heavy floods in the region and had to take a hit of $15 million as its first maize crop was hit severely.The company had acquired 311,000 hectares on a lease-hold basis from the Ethiopian government in the Baka and the Gambela region to cultivate short, medium and long-gestation crops. In the first phase, the company intended to cultivate cereal crops (rice and maize) on 70,000 hectares and oil palm on 20,000 hectares.Even as the company was going through a painful recovery, it had been facing allegations of land grab. Human Rights Watch (HRW), a global independent organisation dedicated to defending and protecting human rights, had earlier raised a red flag on corporates from India, including Karuturi, expanding in Ethiopia. Karuturi had strongly refuted the allegations stating they are empowering the locals with jobs.",issue,2011 Ethiopia floods,Ethiopia,October 2011,December 2011,Baka and the Gambela region,heavy,$15 million,unknown,severe setback for Karuturi's agriculture exports business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Mutt premises, in Mantralayam. He was 80 years old.

The Swamiji had not been keeping well since some months and was suffering from lung infection, multi-organ problems and was being treated at the Mutt by a team of doctors.

He worked hard to rebuild Mantralayam, after it was struck by the heavy floods of the Tungabhadra River in 2009.

Lakhs of devotees were saddened by the news of his death, not only in Mantralyam, but across the globe. Born in Gadag district in Karnataka, his original name was Susheelendra Char.

He completed his B.Sc, B.Ed. and became an expert in Sanskrit before taking sanyasam. He worked as a teacher at Bharateeya Sanskrit Vidyapeetham, in Bangalore, for about 30 years.

He was initially appointed as Uttaradhikari as Sri Suyatheendra Theertha Swamiji, for Sri Raghavendra Swamy Mutt in 2006, by the then Swamiji, Sri Sushameendra Theertha.

Later, he was appointed as Peetadipathi in 2009 and served till he passed away on Thursday night. Sri Suyatheendra Theertha Swamiji initiated a large number of developmental activities at Mantralayam during his tenure.

He took on big projects and gave a face lift to the mukhadwaram, the dining hall and pooja mandapa. He also worked for the progress of schools, drinking water projects and welfare schemes in and around Mantralayam.

Thousands of devotees from various parts of the country thronged Mantralyam to pay their last respects on Friday. The Mutt authorities took out the mortal remains from the Mutt premises to the Sri Raghavendra Swamiji moola brindavanam, on Friday morning, according to madhwa tradition.

He was buried near his predecessor. The grave will be reopened after three months to conduct kalakarshana.

Actor Ali Fazal was upbeat about shooting in Kashmir for ‘Khamoshiyaan’, the second and last schedule of which was to be shot in the picturesque land, which has been ravaged by floods.

The September disaster is the worst flooding in Jammu and Kashmir in half a century. Keeping the situation in mind, the ‘Khamoshiyaan’ team has decided to shift its whole shooting schedule to some other place.

Ali was keen to shoot there as his father studied in Srinagar and Ali heard stories from his father about the beauty of the place.

But now I just hope the damage that happened there to get better soon,” the actor said in a statement. The movie is being produced by Vishesh Films and directed by Karan Dara. On the festival of Diwali, Ali was busy shooting for the film in Cape Town. It also stars Sapna Pabbi and Gurmeet Chaudhary.

One of the most lasting legacies of the Deccan has been the water management policy formulated by the Kakatiya dynasty, which relied mainly on small tanks for its irrigation and drinking water requirements. There was a time when the Telangana countryside boasted of thousands of tanks which ensured a perennial supply of water for settlements across the region.The Qutub Shahi rulers continued the practice by adding numerous tanks of their own, especially in the areas abutting the citadel at Golconda. A majority of those tanks continued to serve the population till post-reorganisation exploitation of the region’s resources led to their being either rendered dry or unusable due to pollution.Following the great floods of 1908, Mahboob Ali Khan, the then Nizam of Hyderabad, sought long-term and effective solutions to the perennial inundation brought on by a recalcitrant Musi. Initiating the process of ‘improvement’ with a search for the right person to handle the future planning of Hyderabad, the Nizam refused the recommendations of Lord Curzon in offering the services of Sir Michel Esthesol, director general of irrigation, Government of India. Ignoring the availability of T D Mackenzie, chief engineer of the Nizam’s Dominions, he chose the native expert Sir M Visvesvarayya for the job. This was not just a pointed snub at the British, who had already antagonized the Nizam with their unreasonable attitude in dealing with the state, but an informed decision if one takes into account the renowned engineer’s role in influencing policy at the irrigation commission. Visvesvarayya’s ingenious flood control proposal for Hyderabad led to the creation of Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar, the two ‘balancing tanks’ located upstream of the city. The twin reservoirs, based on the Kakatiya model, served the dual purpose of taming the Musi and at the same time providing an assured water supply to the city.It is said that 16 villages were submerged to create this sprawling lake, which once spread over 45 square kilometres. The painful displacement of ancient settlements was, however, amply justified by the immediately-apparent benefits of the scheme. Foremost among these was the delivery of safe potable drinking water directly to homes.Popularly known as Gandipet, Osman Sagar has found a unique place in the hearts of a grateful public, who swear by the curative properties of its waters. It is claimed that the Gandipet waters provide a panacea for almost all known ailments. No wonder then that Gandipet ka Pani, along with the equally notorious Hyderabadi Biryani, has been traditionally blamed for luring visitors into settling down in the city once they acquire a taste for these two cherished commodities.Understandably, the Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan remained ever suspicious of Gandipet water, refusing to drink even a single drop from the reservoir named after him! This abhorrence is generally believed to have stemmed from an ingrained preference for the waters of Bam Rukn-ud Dowla, the traditional source of drinking water for Hyderabadi Royalty. The fact that the Nizam never let his personal preferences stand in the way of progress is abundantly manifest in the fact that King Kothi remained unconnected to the state-of-the-art water supply and sewerage network that was commissioned for the city. There is a popular belief that this resolute stand against modernisation arose due to an assurance given by the Nizam to his palace staff that change would not deprive them of their jobs.Hyderabad was once famous for its gardens and the suburbs of the city were referred to as the ‘Baghaat’ or Garden district. However, by the time of the 1908 floods, most of the historic water bodies in the city and its periphery had been commandeered to cater to the drinking water requirements and minor cultivation needs. The lush gardens of Hyderabad were but a distant memory. With the two major reservoirs providing for the water needs of the city, older water bodies were free to cater to parks and gardens proposed under the city improvement scheme. In certain areas, lakebeds were to be drained and reused as open spaces and parks. Though the implementation of CIB proposals was abandoned post re-organisation, the Hussainsagar continued to irrigate the gardens of Osmania University and downstream localities till industrial effluents rendered it into a cesspool.The proposal of the Telangana government in favour of protecting lakes is a welcome move and signals a return to the maliciously abandoned schemes of the CIB. Emulating the Kakatiyan legacy bore fruit during the Asaf Jahi period, especially during the reigns of the last two Nizams. Revisiting Visvesvarayya’s proposals and reverting to traditional water management systems will undoubtedly prove to be immensely beneficial for Telangana.",,1908 Hyderabad floods,"Hyderabad, India",1908-09-07,1908-09-10,Hyderabad,100 mm,100 crores,1000,severe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kavitha Iyer,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Hyderabad_floods_1908.jpg/220px-Hyderabad_floods_1908.jpg,,,,,Severe
487,1565,bangalore,2014,https://www.eco-business.com/news/solar-lanterns-replace-kerosene-lamps-indian-urban-slums/,16 Apr 2014,Solar lanterns replace kerosene lamps in Indian urban slums,"An Indian social enterprise start-up is helping people living in urban slums to use clean energy by changing their kerosene lamps for solar lanterns and wood fires for more efficient cooking stoves through a simple payment scheme.

Pollinate Energy, which began operations in 2013, is one of thousands of social businesses in India which are tapping into the clean energy market, in a country where 35-40 per cent of the population have no access to electricity.

While the majority of those without power live in rural areas, many poor urban communities are also forced to live by candlelight, use polluting fuels like kerosene, or “steal energy” by illegally tapping in to the power lines of wealthier neighbouring residences.

In Bangalore - best known as India’s IT hub - Pollinate Energy markets and sells renewable energy lanterns and stoves on a five-week, interest-free payment plan to families living under tarpaulin sheets in the city’s slums.

“There are actually a lot of organisations selling clean energy products in the rural sector already, and we found that there was a big gap in the market in the urban sector,” said Monique Alfris, co-founder of Pollinate Energy.

“Nobody believes that there are people in urban environments who are using kerosene for light.”

“ There are actually a lot of organisations selling clean energy products in the rural sector already, and we found that there was a big gap in the market in the urban sector Monique Alfris, co-founder of Pollinate Energy

Alfris was speaking on the sidelines of Sankalp Unconvention Summit in Mumbai last week, where hundreds of social entrepreneurs gathered to promote their ideas to help India’s 400 million poor get services such as energy, water, education, housing and healthcare.

Energy poverty

Millions of people who are off the grid in India rely on kerosene lamps, but burning the fuel in poorly ventilated places like a tent or small hut contributes to indoor air pollution, which can cause premature death in women and young children.

New alternatives such as solar lanterns and clean cooking stoves are now being manufactured on a larger scale, but urban slum and village communities have not been aware of these new technologies and have not bought the products.

Pollinate Energy says there is a serious need to focus on urban areas, given the thousands of rural migrants streaming into India’s towns and cities every day, who face “energy poverty” - a lack of access to modern energy services.

“India is one of the fastest urbanising countries in the world. There are always more and more people coming into the cities,” Alfris told Thomson Reuters Foundation.

India’s cities are growing much faster than expected, adding 90 million new residents in the last 10 years, a 2013 World Bank report said. A further 250 million Indians will be living in cities by 2030, it added.

Pollinate Energy has so far sold 4,000 solar lanterns at 1,700 rupees ($30) each. These are not the cheapest on the market, but are of high quality and have a warranty for repair and replacement, Alfris said.

“We’ve so far affected the lives of about 15,000 people,” she said. “In the next three to four years, we are hoping to impact 450,000 people across Bangalore and two other cities.”",solution,Pollinate Energy,"Bangalore, India",2013,Present,Urban slums,,,,"Affected the lives of about 15,000 people","Pollinate Energy sells renewable energy lanterns and stoves on a five-week, interest-free payment plan to families living under tarpaulin sheets in the city’s slums.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe
488,1566,bangalore,2014,https://gulfnews.com/world/americas/the-worlds-10-riskiest-cities-1.1308976,26 Mar 2014,The world’s 10 riskiest cities,"London: What are the world’s riskiest cities when it comes to natural disasters? For the insurance industry it seems an ever-more urgent question, so last year one reinsurance company set out to assess 616 cities around the world for their risk of earthquake, hurricanes and cyclones, storm surge, river flooding and tsunami. Here are Swiss Re’s overall top 10 most risky cities:

1 Tokyo-Yokohama, Japan: With 37 million inhabitants living under the threat of earthquakes, monsoons, river floods and tsunami, the Tokyo-Yokohama region is by far the riskiest in the world: an estimated 80 per cent of Tokyoites, or 29 million, are potentially exposed at any one time to a very large earthquake. Japan is also the country most exposed to tsunami risk, as the country’s urban centres are dotted with an almost perverse accuracy along the Ring of Fire, the active faults of the western Pacific. The Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 devastated both Tokyo and Yokohama, killing an estimated 142,800 people.

2 Manila, Philippines: Built just off the Philippines trench, Manila is one of the most risk-plagued cities you can possibly live in. As well as the substantial earthquake risk, high wind speeds are a severe threat: the powerful typhoon Haiyan that swept the country last year was one of the strongest ever to make landfall. It destroyed several central islands, ruined the coastal city of Tacloban and killed thousands.

3 Pearl River Delta, China: This near-unbroken urban conglomeration, including Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Dongguan, Macau and Ghangzhou, is home to more than 42 million people. One of China’s economic jewels (estimated GDP: $690bn or Dh2.5 trillion) is spread across a flood plain threatened by all manner of natural disasters: it is the number one metropolitan area for storm surge, with 5.3 million people affected, the third-highest for cyclonic wind damage (17.2 million), and the fifth riskiest city for river floods.

4 Osaka-Kobe, Japan: Osaka-Kobe is home to 14.6 million people living under the threat of earthquakes such as the one that killed thousands of people in 1995. It also suffers from brutal storms and the risk of river flooding. And then there are the storm surges, in which heavy winds from typhoons of the kind that hit east Asia whip up gigantic waves: the metropolitan area’s location on a large coastal plain means three million people are at risk. It is also the third-most tsunami-prone city in the world.

5 Jakarta, Indonesia: Fully 40 per cent of Jakarta is below sea level; it lies in a flat basin with soft soil near a fault line. This means earthquakes can be particularly dangerous to its 17.7 million inhabitants, as the soft soil can magnify the intensity of the tremors. Quakes can also liquify Jakarta’s poorly drained soil, causing the ground to lose its structural integrity and react like a liquid. Add to that Jakarta’s risk of river flood and it becomes one of the most exposed cities on the planet.

6 Nagoya, Japan: Tsunami risk dominates in the Pacific. The most exposed cities, dotted along the active faults of the western ocean, are in Japan – led by Tokyo-Yokohama and Nagoya, each with around 2.4 million people potentially affected. With 12 million people in total at great risk, tsunamis affect by far the fewest people of the great five natural disasters analysed here – but the death tolls can be enormous.

7 Kolkata, India: River floods also affect Kolkata, with 10.5 million people at risk – but the eastern Indian city is also fifth in terms of tsunami risk, with more than half a million people exposed. It is also threatened by hurricanes.

8 Shanghai River, China: With so many cities built on flood plains and river deltas, flooding is the most common risk they face. India and China face the most significant risks; with 11.7 million residents directly threatened, Shanghai is a particular hot spot for flooding, but other such risky cities include Bangkok, Mexico City, Baghdad, Paris and Doha.

9 Los Angeles, United States: Its location on the San Andreas Fault makes Los Angeles one of the most earthquake-prone cities – although not as vulnerable to tsunami as might be expected. Subduction zones, where oceanic plates dive underneath the continental crust, generally create much larger tsunamis than so-called “strike-slip” faults such as the San Andreas and Northern Anatolian faults. Small comfort to the 14.7 million inhabitants of the area threatened by earthquake.

10 Tehran, Iran: We generally think of the San Andreas fault or the Pacific Ring of Fire as being the riskiest zones for earthquakes, but not everyone is immediately aware that the Northern Anatolian fault is one of the most dangerous in the world. The entire 13.6 million population of Tehran is exposed, as are the residents of Bucharest, Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, and much of Turkey. The last quake in Tehran was in 1830, and its building regulations are shakily followed at best – making it a city living on borrowed time.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
489,1567,bangalore,2014,https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/a-pearl-losing-its-shine/1252239/,19 May 2014,A pearl losing its shine,"A small pearl shop-owner at the magnificent Charminar, a landmark monument of the old city of Hyderabad, has been selling pearls for the last 40 years. Khan sahib, a pan-chewing, typical Hyderabadi of around 60 years of age, says he has been selling different kinds of pearls of various shapes and sizes. There were days, two decades ago, when he used to get a profit of R50 a month, which gradually increased to R150 per month. However, after 1990s, his business started going downstream. He realised that the City of Pearls, Hyderabad, had started losing its sheen and market momentum, thanks to the advent of Chinese pearls, which could either be cultured or fake.

Hyderabad pearls have had a very long history with the erstwhile Nizams of Hyderabad patronising pearl trade. Once upon a time, Chandanpet, just outside Hyderabad, was popularly known for its expertise in the delicate art of pearl drilling. Around 200 years ago, the trade flourished in the city. Dealers from Persia used to come here to trade and made good money. The city got its name from this trade as the volume of business was huge. Later, the market started to concentrate at other places across the country.

?The once famous Hyderabad pearls, patronised by the Nizams for over 200 years, are losing lustre and sheen. It is very expensive to procure natural pearls. So there is a shift for cheaper ones due to affordability,? says a leading jeweller from the city. Pearls from Japan, Australia, Indonesia, Burma, Venezuela and Tahiti are also coming to the market. Incidentally, pearls from Basra (Iraq) were in huge demand and the city was once a leading producer of natural pearls. But, after the war, production stopped, as most of the oysters died due to excess oil exploration.

Another interesting reason seems to be about the ongoing shift in the customers? preference and the evolving fashion trends which has seen many traders and jewellers change the preferences to precious stones instead of pearls. Says Satish Agarwal, MD, Kundan Jewellers and Exporters, ?There is a change in the fashion, and trends have shrunk the market both in terms of quantity and value over the years. In the last 10 years, sales have decreased by 5%. In fact, it is a gradual falling decade of pearls,? he says with regret.

?Over the last 5 to 10 years, prices of pearls have seen a downfall by 10-20% even while the demand has also fallen by 5%,? Agarwal says. The reason is obvious that the availability of pearls is not at all restricted to Hyderabad. ?Though Hyderabad never produced pearls, the trade was well patronised. However, pearls are now available pan-India,? he says. Thanks to imports from China, which seem to have flooded every jewellery shop.

There is no resale value for pearls, and it is also a one-time buy for a pearl strand, unlike gold or silver jewellery. And this comes at a price. For instance, a strand of South Sea pearls costs between R30,000 and R3 lakh. So this is more or less a one-time buy, rather than a gold jewellery which can be exchanged too. Good quality Tahiti black pearls are available for R50,000 to R1 lakh per strand. This used to be three times more five years ago, jewellers say. ?Diminishing demand for pearls has forced many jewellers to change their loyalty to other precious stones or platinum jewellery,? says another city-based jeweller.

China has been the world?s biggest pearl producer for two decades, flooding the world market with small and cheap pearls. While lot of imports are happening for cultured pearls from Australia, Japan, Indonesia, Tahiti, Venezuela, the demand for South Sea pearls has improved. As Agarwal points out, freshwater pearl farms in east-central China are reported to be producing white pearls that cost a fraction of the saltwater variety. South Sea pearls, which are sourced from the South China Sea, are also readily available and fall in the expensive range because of their large size and sheen. Tahitian pearls cost more than others.

With poor demand and supply of pearls, Hyderabad is no longer called the City of Pearls, with the volumes having shrunk to just a few tonnes. The Hyderabad market has bid adieu to those truly black pearls which were the most beautiful pearls in the world and Hyderabad is a poorer city today for it.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
490,1568,bangalore,2014,https://gulfnews.com/world/europe/britains-river-thames-on-flood-alert-as-blame-game-rages-1.1289150,10 Feb 2014,Britain’s River Thames on flood alert as blame game rages,"London: Thousands of homes in southeast England were braced for flooding on Monday after the River Thames burst its banks, as a political row over the handling of devastating winter storms erupted into the open.

The Environment Agency issued 14 severe flood warnings — meaning lives are at risk — for the Thames in the affluent counties of Surrey and Berkshire to the west of London.

Some areas are already under water, including parts of the Great Windsor Park, near Queen Elizabeth II’s castle at Windsor, which itself is built on higher ground.

London itself is protected by the Thames Barrier, although a suburb to the south of the capital, Croydon, announced plans to divert rising floodwaters caused by heavy rain away from homes and businesses by pumping them into a pedestrian underpass.

Parts of the southwest of England have been under water for weeks after the wettest January since 1766, with more bad weather expected over the coming days.

Forecasters at the Met Office said the run of winter storms, which have brought heavy rain and strong winds and seen high waves batter the English coastline, has been “exceptional in its duration”.

But there has been a growing tide of criticism at the official response, which has erupted into a full-blown political row.

Many people in Somerset, one of the hardest-hit counties in the southwest, blame the devastating floods on the failure of the Environment Agency — a government body — to dredge local rivers.

Communities minister Eric Pickles joined the attack on Sunday, suggesting the government “perhaps relied too much on the Environment Agency’s advice” on flood prevention.

“I am really sorry that we took the advice ... we thought we were dealing with experts,” Pickles, a member of Prime Minister David Cameron’s Conservative party, told BBC TV.

Chris Smith, the head of the Environment Agency, hit back on Monday and accused ministers for holding back vital funds.

“When I hear someone criticising the expertise and professionalism of my staff in the Environment Agency who know more about flood risk management — 100 times more about flood risk management — than any politician ever does, I am not going to sit idly by,” he said.

Smith, a former minister for the now opposition Labour government, said the Treasury had limited the amount the agency could spend on flood management in Somerset.

The Goa arrest was made on May 12th, before the election results were declared, while the Bangalore arrest was made on May 24th. This raised questions on freedom of expression, satire, humour, offense and hatred. Many Bangaloreans were worried as to whether their right to express on social media has just been limited. In this backdrop, Citizen Matters explores the issue.







‘Offensive message through communication service’

The Bangalore arrest was a result of a complaint lodged by an RTI activist, Jayant Mukund Tinaikar, living in Belgaum district. In his complaint, Jayant alleged that he received an offensive message against Modi on WhatsApp on May 16th.

This complaint was later sent to Bangalore’s Cyber Crime Branch for further investigation. The crime branch found that the message originated from Sayed Waqar, an MBA student from Anjuman Institute of Management in Bhatkal, Uttara Kannada district. Waqar was in Bangalore for a month-long internship.

He was booked under Section 505 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for issuing statements amounting to public mischief, with intent to cause fear or alarm and Section 66 of IT Act for sending offensive messages through communication service.

This was not the first time where a person was arrested for raising his or her opinion on social networking sites or apps. There have been several such cases in the past as well.

Cases booked under section 66 A of the IT Act 2000 in past Other sections of IPC clubbed with 66A November 2011: Manoj Oswal – for allegedly having caused ‘inconvenience’ to relatives of Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar for allegations made on his website. Section 500 of the IPC (defamation) April 2012: Jadavpur University Professor Ambikesh Mahapatra – for a political cartoon about West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Section 500 (defamation), Section 509 (insulting the modesty of a woman through word, gesture or act) and section 114 (presence of abettor at the time of commission of offence) October 2012: Ravi Srinivasan, an IAC volunteer, for an allegedly defamatory tweet against the son of Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram May 2012: Two Air India employees jailed for 12 days for allegedly posting defamatory remarks on Facebook and Orkut against a trade union leader and a politician. Section 506(2) of the IPC and Section 2 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act 1971 September 2012: Aseem Trivedi, accused of violation of the IT Act for drawing cartoons lampooning Parliament and the Constitution to depict its ineffectiveness. Section 124A of the IPC, Section 1860 (sedition) and the Prevention of Insults of National Honour Act, 1971. November 2012: Two young women, Shaheen Dadha and her friend Renu Srinivasan, arrested for a comment posted on Facebook that questioned the shutdown of Mumbai following the demise of Shiv Sena Supremo Bal Thackeray. Section 295 (a) of the IPC (for hurting religious sentiments)

In the seven years since the amendment of the IT Act, to incorporate Section 66A in 2008, it has been heavily criticised for being unconstitutional and ambiguous. Most importantly, its violation of the Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India that guarantees freedom of speech and expression has come under heavy criticism. Several Public Interest Litigations have been filed in this regard.

Nothing excluded!

Supreme Court advocate Pavan Duggal, a specialist in the field of cyber laws and a Panel Member at Permanent Monitoring Panel for Information Security, jovially refers to the section 66 A as ‘Mother India’ because its provisions are so vast and huge in ambit, that anything and everything can come under it. “Section 66 A puts one’s neck under chopping block,” he says.

The ambit of the phrase ‘grossly offensive and menacing character’ goes beyond the constitution of India, according to him.

He says the section gives unbridled, absolute powers and discretion in the hands of two entities: the complainant and the police. At the time of registration of the case, as FIR depends on the interpretation of the post by the complainant, on what is of grossly offensive or menacing character.

Experts have noticed distinctive pattern in the cases that are registered under this section. Pavan says, “Invalidly, it is used as a tool to perpetuate harassment in online activity. An activity which is bonafidely done… Mostly the cases registered are by the rich and the powerful people. If a common man tries to file a complaint, he may have to go through a lot of challenges.”

Advocate Danish Sheikh who is working with Alternative Law Forum, and is an expert in laws related to Free Speech and Homosexualitites (LGBT) says, “Typically the cases booked under the section are not against personal remarks, but were moreover against political comments. The basic idea of democracy, which is free speech, is threatened by this section.”

What is Section 66A of the IT act 2000?

The Information Technology Act 2000 was drafted in order to regularise the contents or documents that are broadcasted via any communication medium like computer, internet, press etc. It has 92 sections. In particular, Section 66A was drafted to tackle the information that was being circulated via any communication devices like mobile phones and computers.

The Act says, “any person who sends, by means of a computer resource or a communication device,

a) any information that is grossly offensive or has menacing character,

b) any information which he knows to be false, but for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, or ill will, persistently by making use of such computer resource or a communication device,

c) any electronic mail or electronic mail message for the purpose of causing annoyance or inconvenience or to deceive or to mislead the addressee or recipient about the origin of such messages,

shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and with fine.”

Experts of the of the IT Act have heavily criticised the section for having adopted from the UK Communication Act 2003 and the Communications Act 1988. Both the acts are applicable only when the communication is directed to a specific person.

Snehashish Ghosh, Policy Associate at Centre for Internet and Society, says in The Business Line : “Section 1 of the Malicious Prosecution Act begins stating that, “any person who sends to another person.” Therefore it is clear that the provision does not include any post or electronic communication which is broadcasted to the world and deals with only one-to-one communication.”

Who can file a case?

Anyone can file a case under Section 66A. If your comment, post, pictures circulated via communication devices are found to be offensive or a threat to a person, community or to the nation, you can be arrested under this section.

Superintendent of Police, Cyber Crime Branch, Bangalore, D Roopa says: “Till date, people who were booked cases under this act are mostly zealous political leaders who want to create impressions about top leaders. There has been no case where police has taken a suo motu action and booked someone under Section 66A.” She adds that it is not even right for a police officer to take suo motu action, until there is threat to the communities, integrity or sovereignty of the nation (terrorism, naxalism etc).

In November 2012, a PIL was filed by Delhi-based Law student Shreya Singhal, challenging the vagueness of Section 66A of the IT Act, and its inability to judge with objective standards, which makes one susceptible to deliberate abuse.

The SC maintained the constitutionality of Section 66A; by citing the ‘Advisory on Implementation of Section 66A of the Information Technology Act 2000’ written by Department of Electronics and Information Technology on January 9th 2013, submitted to the Chief Secretaries and the Director General of Police of all States/UTs.

The Advisory mandates police take arbitrary action, without the approval of officers, not below the rank of Inspector General of Police (IGP) in the metropolitan cities or Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), or Superintendent of Police (SP) at the district level.

Advocate Pavan Duggal finds giving the police officers such discretionary powers, makes it more dangerous and a potent weapon to use against anybody. Gautam Bhatia an expert in Free Speech said, “The history of the relentless abuse of Section 295A, 153A of the IPC and Section 66A of the IT Act 2000, demonstrates that neither local police, nor magistrates can be trusted with sensible application of these sections. If the SC is to give this manner of discretion, it needs to be accompanied with clear guidelines about the scope of the section.”

However, Advocate Danish Sheikh feels the provision is necessary. “There is a need to have layers of decision makers to ensure that the right decision is taken. This will safeguard people from unnecessarily getting prosecuted under the law,” he says.

While one of them, 21-year-old Murti, died from drowning, the other five managed to escape a series of calamities as they found themselves stranded in the thick jungle, engulfed by floodwaters and chased down by a herd of elephants - all in the middle of the night.According to police, Venkatesh, Kantaraju, Anil, Hombaiah, Girish and Murti, all residents of Bangalore, drove to Muttati on Tuesday in an Indica car. After spending the day, at around 10.30pm, they decided to head back to Bangalore and took the Muttati-Satanur road.While driving in the forest area, they lost their way and inadvertently took a wrong turn to a mud road which eventually led them to a stream. The stream was in full spate due to heavy rain in the region. They didn't realize the depth of water and drove the car straight into the flood waters. The water current carried the vehicle along with its occupants. While five of them managed to extricate themselves out of the car, Murti couldn't and he was swept away along with the car.The other swam to safety and frantically began to search for their missing friend. While they were scouring the area, they found themselves amid a herd of elephants. As the elephants came for them, the youth quickly climbed some trees and stayed up till dawn.On Wednesday morning, they clambered down and continued their search for Murti.

According to latest news, It is stated that the concert will be performed on Monday.

""Jinxed."" That was overwhelming opinion of fans of Swedish electronic dance super-group Swedish House Mafia after their concert had to be cancelled for the second time in India in less than three months.

The concert, scheduled in Bangalore for Sunday was put off as the plane carrying the group from Jakarta to India was damaged following a storm and floods there, and the members were unable to leave, a note on the SHM Facebook page said.

The SHM concert in Mumbai on November 17 was postponed on account of Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray's death.

Organisers of the event, Sunburn Arena, said they were working to reschedule the Bangalore show, part of the band's farewell tour, for Monday, January 21. This has not yet been confirmed.

Ticket-holders were promised a refund if the concert was cancelled.

But this came as small consolation to fans, who took to social media sites to express their disappointment even as rumours about the postponement were put to rest with the group's announcement.

""We've been looking forward to the show since September, when it was initially announced,"" said Ashmita Mangharam, a class 12 student in Bangalore. She says she lost about Rs. 9,000 making the trip for the cancelled concert in Mumbai last year, with 15 other friends.

Dhiren Raghu, an engineering student at R.V. College too says he spent Rs. 15,000 on his savings to make the trip to Mumbai last year, and was excited that the group whom he had followed for years was finally coming to Bangalore. ""I hope the concert happens on Monday,"" he said.

Questions to the organisers on the number of tickets sold and the security measures in place to control crowds, were not answered at the time of writing. At least 25,000 people were expected to attend the concert in Mumbai and a similar number in Bangalore.

The rescheduled show in Mumbai will go on as announced on Tuesday, organisers added.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The Dhari Devi idol had stood for the last 800 years in the middle of the Alaknanda river on a small island and was moved on 16 June amidst protest, and in violation of a High Court order, to higher ground, since the water from a hydro-electric project upstream was going to submerge it.

The day the idol was moved coincided with the cloudburst over Kedarnath, resulting in many blaming the moving of the idol for the tragedy.

A local resident, Suman Nautiyal, told IBN Live that “Dhara Devi protected her temple and her devotees all these years…then they uprooted the temple and this calamity happened.”

However, the head priest of the temple isn't buying the theory for now.

“Man has constructed these dams, we are to blame, don’t blame the gods” head priest BP Pande told IBNLive. “We harmed nature, and now this is nature’s retaliation.”

According to a report in Zee News, the hydroelectric project was facing opposition from locals, saints and the BJP since it would effectively submerge the temple.

""People staged protest against the hydro power project and opposed the idea of uplifting the statue,” VHP head Ashok Singhal told India Today.

Former IIM Bangalore professor Bharat Jhunjhunwala, another local resident, told CNN-IBN that he had watched the unplanned and unsustainable abuse of nature, which was to be blamed for the scale of the tragedy.

It is easily an occasion for a double celebration on this innocuously calm, green sprawl on the busy National Highway 7, but the air is subdued. Overhead in the campus, an occasional steel-grey helicopter whirrs about. Below, men and women in blue go about their businesses in buildings that are sheathed in tranquil blue and white.

When you visit the place outside the riotous two-yearly Aero India extravaganza, everything about Air Force Station Yelahanka, located some 20 km north of Bangalore city, belies the dangerous times it lives.

All of 50 years this year, the air base has hosted nine of these international air shows for the Ministry of Defence since 1993.

There is also a quiet sense of pride and heritage as the 81 Air Force Day – October 8 – draws close.

The Yelahanka air base continues to be a vital cog in producing trained pilots to fly the IAF’s transport planes and helicopters, according to Air Commodore S.P. Singh, who is its Air Officer Commanding.

As the Force expands its fleet with new generation transport planes like the C-130J and the C-17, the role of the training station can only grow, he said during a media open house at the air base on Thursday.

The Yelahanka air base was born in 1963 when the Air Force started strengthening its training operations just after the war with China. A World War II airfield was refurbished and the training base took off on August 1, 1963 with a first batch of transport plane pilots graduating out of here.

A helicopter unit was added in 192 and now the base houses four units. Today the IAF trains pilots for its AN-32 and Dornier 228 transport planes; and for the Mi-8 and Chetak copters.

Around 35 pilots are currently training on transport planes and another 20 on helicopters after basic stints, Air Commodore Singh said. Each year it produces some 350 pilots from all streams.

The station houses seven squadrons of transport plane and two squadrons of Mi-8 copters. All of which makes the station clock one of the IAF’s highest number of flying hours – 20,000.

Thoroughbred saviours

At the entrance to the 112 Helicopter Unit are scores of pictures of their heroes. One particular display dated September 2009 catches the eye. One of their men is `winching’ down a helicopter in forest clearing.

112 HU’s commanding officer, Wing Commander Manish Sharma, explained that it was a gunner coming down to retrieve the body of former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S.Rajashekar Reddy who died in a helicopter crash near Kurnool. The unit called Thoroughbreds trains its personnel to save people, sometimes collect bodies from such disasters. It also turns out 50-100 flight engineers and gunners each year who go on to serve also on the IL-76, IL-78 and AN-32 planes.

One of the oldest IAF units, 112 HU doubles up with a wartime role such as in Kargil, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh; or supporting civil operations during cyclones, floods and VVIP movements.

Eagle’s eye

Yelahanka’s busy military Air Traffic Control, some five storeys high, keeps an eagle’s eye day and night on over 250 flight movements each day – both from its fleet and the commercial planes landing and taking off at the civil international airport 15 km up north, said its ATC, Wing Commander Ruhi Bhullar.

The air base of a perimeter of 12 km houses about 3,000 air officers and personnel. Just across the road are bustling set-ups of their families and amenities.

Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.

Terrorism in India

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in India.

There is a heightened risk of terrorism in some Indian regions. Read our advice on regional risks in India for more information.

Terrorist and insurgent groups operating in India include:

Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LET), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM) in Kashmir

Naxalite (radical communist insurgent) groups active in India’s eastern states

Khalistani extremists operating mainly in Punjab

Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), and other groups may also be planning attacks

Terrorist attacks have mainly targeted Government of India interests. Security has been strengthened, notably at major hotels and transport hubs. However, terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreign nationals, such as:

restaurants, hotels, bars, and markets

stations and airports

places of worship and tourist attractions

festivals, sports venues, and beaches

Take particular care during periods of national or religious significance, such as:

Republic Day (26 January)

Independence Day (15 August)

Diwali (usually in October or November)

Eid (date changes each year)

Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.

Political situation

Strikes (sometimes referred to as ‘bandh’ or ‘hartal’), political rallies and demonstrations occur frequently and can become violent. The risks are higher during elections and after the death of party or government leaders. Protests may also occur at short notice, especially around days of national importance. Local authorities may impose curfews and other restrictions at short notice. Transport and public services including mobile and internet network coverage may be disrupted at short notice.

You should:

avoid protests or large gatherings, including at religious sites

follow the advice of the local authorities and your travel company

monitor local media and follow any curfew restrictions

Crime

If you’re the victim of crime, call Police helpline number 100 or National Emergency Number 112 and ask for police assistance.

India’s Women Helpline Number is 1091.

Protecting your belongings

Keep a copy of your passport, visa, and flight ticket separately from originals when travelling. Leave copies at home where others can access them, and also store them electronically so you can access them easily. If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the police immediately and get a police report.

Take particular care of your possessions on buses, trains and in crowds. Criminals may ride past on motorbikes and snatch valuables.

Be cautious in tourist areas, where scammers, pickpockets and ticket touts target foreigners.

Scams

Cybercrime, internet scamming, card skimming, and confidence scams are common. These scams come in many forms and can pose great financial loss for the victims.

Criminals often use the details of British High Commissions and embassies to carry out their fraud. Be cautious and check the authenticity of details before responding.

Drink and food spiking

As in the UK, be wary of accepting drinks or food from strangers or of leaving drinks unattended. There have been reports of spiked drinks and food, with travellers, including British nationals, subsequently being robbed, or assaulted.

Sexual assault

Sexual assaults occur. This includes attacks on foreign female visitors in tourist areas and cities.

Female travellers often experience verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. Serious sexual attacks involving both Indian and foreign nationals have been reported. British women have been victims of sexual assault, including rape, in Goa, Delhi, Rajasthan, Mumbai and Kerala. Avoid isolated areas, including beaches, when alone at any time of day.

Read our advice for women travelling abroad.

Laws and cultural differences

There may be serious legal penalties for doing something which may not be illegal in the UK.

Dress code

Women travelling in India should respect local customs and dress codes.

Alcohol laws and bans

Laws on alcohol, including buying, drinking and the legal drinking age, vary by state. Get advice from your travel agent, hotel, or the authorities about the laws in areas you are visiting.

It is an offence to drink alcohol in public places, such as public parks.

In some states, foreign nationals and non-resident Indians can buy 30-day alcohol permits.

There is often a ban on the sale of alcohol during major religious festivals, national holidays, and elections.

The consumption, production or transportation of alcohol is banned in:

Bihar

Gujarat

Mizoram

Nagaland

the region of Lakshadweep

Manipur

If you drink or possess alcohol in these states, you could be arrested without bail. Charges can carry a prison sentence of 5 to 10 years.

Smoking and e-cigarette bans

Smoking is banned in most public places. You should only smoke in designated smoking areas.

E-cigarettes and related products are banned. You will be unable to buy e-cigarettes in India or bring them into the country.

Illegal drugs and prison sentences

Do not get involved with any illegal drugs. Drugs are not categorised as they would be in the UK, into Class A, B and C. There is a minimum sentence of 6 months for possession of small amounts deemed for personal consumption only. A 10-year sentence for possession of other amounts applies. The judicial process is slow and being detained for several years whilst your case is processed is normal.

Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas

Activities involving cameras and binoculars, like photography, bird-watching, or plane spotting, may be misunderstood. Be particularly careful near military sites, government buildings, airports, and railway stations.

Swimming safety

Every year, several people drown due to strong currents in the sea. There are strong currents off many coasts. Most beaches do not have warning signs, flags, or lifesaving equipment. Take local advice, follow warnings and instructions issued by lifeguards. Emergency service standards may differ from those in the UK.

Trekking in India

Trekkers should:

travel in groups

use reputable local guides and stay on established routes

check if you need any special permits

Leave details of where you’re going and when you expect to return with your accommodation. You are extremely unlikely to have a phone signal in the mountains, so make sure your accommodation provider registers your whereabouts using the online C-form.

It is illegal to possess or operate satellite phones without prior permission of the Indian authorities.

The following hazards exist throughout the year, especially above 3,000 metres (m):

altitude sickness - see our advice on Health in India

sudden weather changes, including thunderstorms

avalanches and snow drifts

landslides, flooding, and rock falls

Make sure your insurance policy covers you for altitudes over 2,400m and mountain rescue and helicopter costs.

There are no commercial mountain rescue services operating above 3,000m. In some border areas only the Indian Air Force can carry out air rescues. However, they are under no obligation to perform them and only carry out rescues during working hours.

LGBT+ travellers

Same-sex relationships are legal in India. However same-sex marriage is still illegal. Indian society remains conservative. This includes attitudes to LGBT+ people, which can be less accepting than in the UK. There is a risk of harassment and discrimination, especially outside of big cities.

Showing affection in public can receive unwanted attention.

Read our advice for LGBT+ travellers.

Child custody and family law

Indian family law is very different from UK law. Special caution is needed when child custody becomes an issue. In case of dispute, consult a local lawyer to find out more about the relevant laws.

Commercial surrogacy is illegal for foreign nationals in India. Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) can seek legal guidance on surrogacy if at least one partner is an Indian passport holder.

Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs

It is illegal to buy, sell, kill, or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. India has a strong legal framework to regulate and restrict wildlife trade and is also a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). If you’re caught purchasing or trafficking such goods illegally, you will be prosecuted and receive a prison sentence or fine.

Sexual offences against children

The penalties for child sex offences are severe. There is a minimum jail term of 20 years, which may go up to life imprisonment, or a death sentence for those convicted of raping a child aged under 12.

Transport risks in India

Be wary of unofficial transport at airports.

British tourists have been scammed by drivers who offer cheap transportation or hotels, unwanted tours, and extended taxi rides. Travellers who accept these offers have reported being threatened with violence when they have declined to pay.

Taxis and rickshaws

When using taxis or rickshaws:

avoid travelling alone and hailing taxis on the street, especially at night

use official taxi ranks. Pre-paid taxi services are available from inside all airport terminal buildings and many hotels offer transfers. Ride-hailing services like Uber and Ola are also widely available in India

if you’re being collected at the airport by a hotel driver, make sure they properly identify themselves before you set off

if you book a taxi online, there’s usually a way to share journey details with your contacts who can then follow your location

Cars and motorbikes

Road accidents including car and motorbike accidents are one of the biggest causes of injury and death overseas. Police figures estimate more than 150,000 people are killed every year in road accidents across India. Several British nationals are either injured or killed each year on Indian roads.

Road traffic hazards include:

reckless driving and manoeuvring

poorly maintained vehicles

poor quality and congested roads

roads shared with pedestrians, carts, cattle and other livestock

vehicles running red lights

protests - see our advice on the Political Situation in India

extreme weather and natural disasters - see our advice on Extreme weather in India

Driving in India

If you are planning to drive in India, see information on driving abroad.

You can drive with a UK licence and an accompanying international driving permit after you arrive, but rules on how long you can drive on a UK licence vary from state to state.

Driving can be dangerous in urban and rural areas due to wandering livestock, including cows. Cows are considered sacred in India and road accidents involving cows can draw crowds or potentially lead to violence. If you are involved in a road accident, you may be attacked or become a victim of extortion, even if you were not driving the vehicle. If you hit a cow or pedestrian, you should comply with the police if they are at the scene. If the police are not present, it could be unsafe to remain at the scene of an accident of this nature, if safe to do so you may prefer to find the nearest police station.

It is common to use your horn or flash your headlights frequently to announce your presence on the road.

If possible, avoid travelling at night and in fog as accidents are common due to low visibility and there is a higher risk of crime at night. Always travel in a well-maintained vehicle. Seatbelts are not common in three-wheel taxis (autos) or in the back seats of taxis. Try to use only cars that have seatbelts.

If you travel by motorbike, wear a helmet and proper footwear.

Buses are a convenient mode of transport, serving almost every city across India. However, they are often driven fast and recklessly. Accidents are common.

Vehicles drive on the left in India. Pedestrians should exercise caution when crossing streets, even in marked pedestrian areas and especially at night, as vehicles sometimes drive on the wrong side of the road.

Air travel

When you are travelling through an airport, allow enough time to complete check-in and security procedures, as your baggage may need to go through screening equipment and checks. Allow time for transiting between flights if you need to change from international terminals to domestic terminals, even if using the airport shuttle service.

Tourists flying on charter flights booked through a tour operator can only fly into and out of the country by using the services of the same charter operator. Chartered flight passengers are not permitted to fly on inward or outward journeys using a scheduled airline.

Rail travel

India has a large passenger train network throughout the country. Although train travel in India is generally safe, accidents do occur and have previously resulted in death and serious injury. There are police or guards on trains and stations if you need help.

When travelling by train:

do not accept food or drinks from strangers

thefts are common - take care of your passport and valuables

avoid people at railway stations offering tickets and tours as you may be scammed

Sea travel

Tourist boats and other small crafts rarely carry life-saving equipment.

Although piracy has not so far affected India’s territorial waters, it poses a significant threat in parts of the Indian Ocean. Mariners should follow shipping industry guidelines on precautions to take.

Ships and crew must have the necessary authorisation and paperwork before entering Indian territorial waters and abide by Indian laws and regulations. If carrying weapons on board ships in Indian territorial waters, you must follow Indian laws and regulations.

Extreme weather and natural disasters

India can experience extreme weather events that can be hazardous to life and disrupt infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and communications.

Plan your travel so that you are aware of seasonal weather events, such as monsoon rains, as well as what to do if there is a natural disaster. Follow the advice of local authorities and your travel company. Consult the Indian Meteorological Department for local and international weather updates.

Monsoons

Highest risk: June to October

Monsoon rains can cause:

flooding and landslides, sometimes leading to significant loss of life

towns and villages to be cut off for days

serious disruption to road and train travel

disruption in big cities due to flooding

other services including telephone lines, internet services and electricity supply to be affected

Cyclones and tropical storms

Highest risk:

East coast of India (September to December)

Bay of Bengal (April to June and September to December)

South India (June to November)

Tropical cyclones can cause:

high winds: buildings can be damaged or destroyed, trees, power and telephone lines toppled, flying debris can be dangerous

storm surges: can provoke a temporary rise in sea level of several metres which can flood coastal areas and damage buildings on the shoreline

very heavy rainfall: this can cause localised or widespread flooding and mudslides

See our advice on Extreme weather and natural hazards for more information.

Earthquakes

Several parts of India lie on highly active fault zones (including areas of the North and North-east). The most active are along the length of the Himalayas. Earth tremors are common in these regions and can cause landslides. Limited emergency response vehicles, equipment, and medical facilities could increase the impact an earthquake has.

As one the country’s biggest ever scientific quests takes off for Mars today, this is the time to revisit the nerve centre where the ‘plot’ was hatched, crafted, refined and unleashed.

Back in 1989, when a rather obscure department of the Central Government moved into its current 20-acre campus from its temporary location in Cauvery Bhavan on Kempe Gowda Road, not many people noticed; not many people then lived around here anyway.

From a lake bed

About a kilometre down from M.S. Ramaiah Hospital and off New BEL Road is the seat of the headquarters of the Department of Space, Antariksh Bhavan. An old-timer recalls that the land on which Antariksh Bhavan was built was the dried bed of Devasandra lake.

Then it was better known as Devasandra, recalls S. Satya [name changed on request], an engineer who recently retired as the head of one of ISRO’s key departments.

Antariksh Bhavan houses the DoS Secretariat and headquarters of ISRO, where policies are framed on the country’s communication satellites that keep the hundreds of television channels going, support our Internet, telephones and weather forecasts, or the remote-sensing satellites that keep track of natural resources, floods and disasters, among others.

Desolate, once upon a time

In the early 1990s, New BEL Road was a mud road. “It used to be desolate all around and we saw very few houses,” recalls Mr. Satya.

Sanjaynagar, according to him, became the chosen seat of the Department of Space because it was close to two of its old big brothers whom it soon outgrew in stature.

One was the Indian Institute of Science, some 8 km away, whose then-Director Satish Dhawan was also the Chairman of ISRO. On the other side, virtually down the road, was Bharat Electronics Ltd. (BEL), which had a [now defunct] division fabricating electronics for space use.

Today, the three-storey granite-floored edifice sits quiet and cosy in a verdant setting. Since 1989, four of ISRO’s six chairmen helmed the organisation from here: U.R. Rao, K. Kasturirangan, G. Madhavan Nair, and the incumbent, K. Radhakrishnan.

Prices up

And all those branded goods showrooms, eateries and premium electronics shops around New BEL Road owe much “to the presence of the Space HQ,” according to A. Sridhar, a resident of Sanjaynagar and employee with ISRO for over 25 years. “The real estate prices have zoomed and today Sanjaynagar is a premium place in Bangalore,” he adds.

But down the years since the 1990s, ISRO has also lost a certain people-connect. Old-timers like Mr. Satya find it inconceivable that the country’s high-profile department once was shielded by nothing more than barbed wire, not unlike a public park of today.

Antariksh Bhavan is today a three- to four-layered security fortress. The attack on New York’s twin towers; the Mumbai terror attack; and other incidentshave all changed the access forever, says Mr. Satya.",discussion,2013 Bangalore floods,"Bangalore, India","July 25, 2013","August 10, 2013","['Bangalore', 'Karnataka']","['100 mm in 24 hours', '200 mm in 48 hours']","['Rs. 10,000 crore', '100,000 houses damaged', '100 people killed']",,"['Disruption of transportation', 'Waterlogging', 'Landslides']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

In its report to the Union Home Ministry,the State Disaster Mitigation and Management Centre has said that casualties in the affected areas may run into thousands with about 90 ‘dharamashalas’ (rest houses for pilgrims) swept away in the flash floods. However,the toll has been kept officially at 150.

In Uttarakhand,over 15,000 people stranded in Kedarnath and Govindghat on way to Hemkund Sahib have been evacuated so far to Joshimath relief camps through air and road routes,IG police R S Meena said.

“Apart from the 12 helicopters already engaged in rescue operations in affected areas,eight more have been roped in for the purpose to step up the process,” Meena said.

Rudraprayag district worst hit

Rescue efforts are being concentrated as of now on Kedarnath shrine and its adjoining areas in Rudraprayag district,which has been the worst hit with about 90 dharamshalas in the temple area  where pilgrims were staying  having been swept away by the flood waters,he said.

Two helicopters have flown from Dehradun to evacuate stranded people.The Army has also deployed its mountain rescue teams to evacuate the pilgrims.

Scores of villages remain under water and cannot be tracked. Hence there is uncertainty about the casualties caused,he said,adding the “devastation is massive”.

Rescue efforts also picked up in rain-battered tribal Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh with two IAF and one state chopper making sorties to rescue 600 tourists and others stranded in remote areas.

The sorties started at 6.30 am and people stranded at various places for past five days are being dropped at Rampur,official sources said.

New Delhi: The legal system of Saudi Arabia is based on Sharia, Islamic law derived from the Quran, and thus discrimination against women here still continues.

The Saudi law solely adheres to Holy Quran -- which all judges have to interpret conservatively.

Earlier, women were not allowed to vote in elections but recently, women in Saudi Arabia are registering to vote for the first time in history, more than four years after King Abdullah granted equal voting rights.

India TV brings to you 15 staggering facts about Saudi:

1. One person executed every other day in 2015

Saudi Arabia carried out at least 157 executions in 2015, with beheadings reaching their highest level in the kingdom in two decades.

Human Rights observers found that of the first 100 prisoners executed in 2015, 56 had been based on judicial discretion and not for crimes for which Islamic law mandates a specific death penalty punishment. The Kingdom witnessed a rise in number of people executed for non-lethal offenses that judges have wide discretion to rule on, particularly for drug-related crimes.

Annual execution tolls for Saudi Arabia in recent years have rarely exceeded 90 for the entire year.

2. Saudi is largest country in world without a river

Today about 50% of drinking water comes from desalination, 40% from the mining of non-renewable groundwater and only 10% from surface water in the mountainous South-West of the country.

3. Women can't drive car

Driving a car in Saudi is strictly prohibited for women. However, there is no official law that bans women from driving.

Saudi clerics argue that female drivers undermine social values and hence they can't drive.

A group of Saudi women had in 2011 organised the 'Women2Drive' to raise awareness on the issue but it was not a major success.

In 2014, the advisory council to King of Saudi Arabia had recommended the country's government lift the long-standing ban on women drivers despite decades of cracking down on protests.

4. No gym for girls

There are no laws against women exercising outside their homes, but in this conservative society many are influenced by scholars and clerics who argue against it.

In girls' schools and universities, there are no gym classes or sports teams.

However, private gyms for women were allowed to operate until the Religious Police decided to close them down for good.

Some Saudi clerics have campaigned for women-only gyms to be shut down and declared that sport could cause women to lose their virginity.

Saudi also faces a ban from the International Olympic Committee for never sending out any female delegates.

5. Saudi Arabia's Jeddah Tower to be world's tallest building

The Jeddah Tower, also known as the Kingdom Tower, will be the first building in the world to reach a full kilometer into the air.

Jeddah Tower will make Dubai's Burj Khalifa the second tallest building on Earth, standing at 2,722 feet tall at its spire.

Construction of the Jeddah tower has already started and when it is completed it will have 200 floors.

The Saudi government has announced that Jeddah Tower will become operational by December 2018.

Also, the expected cost of the Jeddah Tower's construction is 19.2 times as much as the amount Taylor Swift made in 2014.

The Jeddah Tower is expected to cost $1.23 billion whereas Taylor Swift in 2014 raked $64 million.

6. Women can't go anywhere without a chaperone

Women in Saudi need to be accompanied by a male partner whenever they leave the house.

These male guardians are known as a 'mahram'.

The 'mahram' needs to accompany the woman every time she leaves her home.

This system is based on the notion that giving freedom of movement to women would make them vulnerable to sins.

There were reports that once a teenager was gang-raped in Saudi. When this incident took place, the victim was not with a mahram. The court punished her for going outside without her guardian.

The Saudi government has recently announced that it was considering lifting restrictions on women that would allow them to travel without mahram.

7. No selling or wearing anything red on Valentine's Day

Flower shops and gift shops are prohibited from selling red roses, anything heart-shaped or red on Valentine's Day.

Schoolgirls, ladies are prohibited from wearing anything red - not even a red scarf.

Any girl that shows up to school with a hint of red is barred from entry and is sent home to change whatever it is that is red.

The usual reasoning for banning anything red is because it is not an Islamic occasion and also to prevent from having any contact outside marriage.

8. Women can't work

Women are not allowed to do most of the jobs that men can do in Saudi.

Most women work in either education or the medical field. Women have only recently been allowed to work as store clerks or at department stores.

At a few hypermarkets, women need to cover their faces at all times while working.

One notable place of business where women are absent from is the lingerie store, which are still fully staffed by men.

9. Ghawar oil field can fill 4,770,897 Olympic swimming pools

Saudi Arabia's Ghawar field is the largest in the world. It has an estimated 75 billion barrels of oil left. It can fill 4,770,897 Olympic swimming pools.

An Olympic-size swimming pool can hold 660,253.09 gallons of liquid.

10. Kingdom's petroleum sector makes up 45% of GDP

Saudi Arabia has an oil-based economy with strong government control over major economic activities. It is the world's leading oil exporter and second largest producer.

The petroleum sector accounts for almost all of Saudi government revenues and export earnings. It accounts for roughly 92.5% of Saudi budget revenues, 90% of export earnings, and 45% of GDP.

Also the Saudi's population was around 28.8 million in 2013, which is slightly above that of Texas' 26.5 million. But its GDP in 2013 was around $750 billion, while Texas' was approximately twice that amount, at $1.4 trillion.

Also, Saudi's annual military expenditure is 4 times as much as the GDP of Afghanistan. In 2014, Saudi Arabia's military expenditure budget was $80.8 billion, $13 billion more than 2013's.

The military expenditure of Saudi accounts nearly 10.4% of its GDP, putting it at the fourth place in the list of defence military expenditure, just behind the US, China, and Russia.

The total defence expenditure was also 4 times of the Afghanistan's GDP which was $20.7 billion in 2013.

11. Women can't participate in sporting events

Saudi Arabia had proposed hosting an Olympic Games without women. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) had turned down any suggestion of Saudi Arabia making a joint bid with Bahrain and holding men and women's events in different territories.

The society here is very conservative and it is hard time to accept that women can compete in sports.

When Saudi Arabia sent its female athletes to the London games for the first time, hard-line clerics denounced the women as ""prostitutes"".

While they were allowed to compete, they had to be accompanied by a male guardian and wear a ""Sharia-compliant"" sports kit that covered their hair.

12. 60% of labour forces in Saudi are foreigners

Most foreign workers in GCC countries are from Asian countries. In Saudi, the foreign workers account nearly 60 per cent and Arabs comprise 30 percent of the total foreign workforce.

Reports say that Saudi nationals prefer to work largely in the public sector with little interest to join the private sector. As a result, most of the people who work in the oil and service sectors in Saudi are foreigners.

Also, Saudi's female labour-force participation rate was roughly 20%, the eighth-lowest in the world. The US's female labour force participation rate is around 47%, Germany's is around 54%, and Japan's is at 49%.

13. 47% population under 24 and 5% over 60

The population of Saudi Arabia represents 0.41 percent of the world's total population.

Saudi Arabia's population as of 2014 January was 27,345,986. About 47% of the total population is below 24 years age. Only 5 percent of the total population is above 60 years.

14. Women limit their interaction with men

Women here are required to limit the amount of time spent with men they are not related to.

Media reports suggested that majority of public places including offices, banks and universities have separate entrances for men and women.

Public transportation, parks, beaches and amusement parks are also separate in most parts of the country.

Unlawful mixing can lead to criminal charges.

15. 100 camels are sold in Riyadh every day

Camels can survive the hottest climates on earth. They are commonly used for transportation in the desert and temperatures in these areas can rise as high as 500° C.

Riyadh's camel market is one of the largest in the world and is said to sell about 100 camels every day.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The government is contemplating opening coaching centres across Karnataka to help students prepare for various competitive examinations, according to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.

He was speaking after felicitating toppers from the Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeswara Training Institute for Competitive Examinations (JSSTICE) selected for civil services, here on Monday. Of the 11 toppers, six were present.

Mr. Siddaramaiah said that with more centres, the number of students from the State clearing the All-India service examinations may increase. He recalled that JSSTICE was set up in 1990 for this exact purpose. He lauded the foresight of Shivarathri Deshikendra Swami in setting up the institute, which is now one of the leading training institutes for civil service and other competitive examinations.

He called upon the toppers to serve the people, connect with them and solve their problems. “If you solve their problems at your level, the number of people coming to politicians seeking help will come down. After I became Chief Minister, I have met hundreds of people who sought help for small issues. If officials (KAS and IAS officers) discharge their duties with integrity, society will benefit and the government will get a good name,” he said.

Shivarathri Deshikendra Swami urged toppers to become good administrators. “These officials will be different from others, as they were trained at JSSTICE,” he said.

He said that the Suttur Math will be assisting the government in its efforts to rescue people from the State who are still stranded in Uttarakhand following the devastating floods last week. He also lauded the government’s decision to strictly check the sale of spurious liquor and not issue any new liquor licences. He said the math would soon launch an alcohol de-addiction programme.

The six toppers who were felicitated were Snehal Rayamane (rank 77), Sandeep G. Rajappa (412), Shilpa Nag C.T. (434), K.P. Pradeep (725), J. Lohitheshwar (783) and Manjunath Kanamadi (900).",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Several underpasses were blocked, roads and bridges were damaged and facilities were flooded under the onslaught of the heavy rains that have lashed at the Arabian Gulf this week, resulting in deaths and injuries and loss of private property.

In Kuwait, Abdul Aziz Al Ebrahim, the Minister of Public Works and Electricity and Water, has come under harsh criticism for the perceived failure to deal with the heavy rains that have affected the country in the past two days.

Reports in Kuwait said that the drainage system failed to take in the large amounts of rainwater, turning several areas into ponds.

Opposition lawmakers used the situation to level corruption charges against government officials and to accuse them of their lack of preparedness for rainfalls.

In Saudi Arabia, the authorities are in a challenging race against time and difficult weather conditions, are working on limiting damages and ensuring there would be no repeat of the tragedies of the western city of Jeddah on the Red Sea coast in which 10 people were killed in 2011 and dozens in 2009.

Civil Defence officers said that four people were killed and ten reported missing.

Two of the victims were in the capital Riyadh and the other two in the northeastern city of Arar. Three more people are being treated at a hospital in Arar.

The officers said that seven of the missing were in Riyadh and the other three in Arar.

On Tuesday, the civil defence in Riyadh received 1,700 calls for assistance.

“We have rescued 300 people and helped pull out 110 cars and buses that had been carried by the floods,” the civil defence, said, quoted by local news site Sabq.

More than 6,140 calls for help were placed in the other parts of the vast kingdom and civil defence teams were able to rescue 1,357 Saudi nationals and expatriates, it said.

“In Hael, in the north, where 631 incidents were reported, the civil defence was able to rescue 11 people in a van surrounded by floods,” it said.

Pictures circulated on social media and in the local media showed damaged roads and bridges, furious streams of water and immobilised cars.

They also depicted the suffering of people trying to reach their places of work and children attempting to surf their way into their schools.

The study,undertaken by Sherly M A,a research scholar at IIT Bombay-Monash Research Academy,is aimed at assessing and mapping the spatial-temporal pattern of hydrologic,hydraulic,socio-economic and infrastructural elements that contribute to flood risk and vulnerability for Mumbai.

The commercial capital of India is a small island city with a geographical area of less than 500 sq km (under MCGM). It has a population density of around 20,000 persons per sq km and more than 50 per cent population lives in slum areas. The city faces floods almost annually due to heavy rainfall during the south-west monsoon. The ever-growing population has resulted in rampant encroachment,leading to the blocking of natural channels that used to drain rainwater. Its impaired drainage system and high tides make the city and its infrastructure vulnerable, said Sherly.

According to the findings, slum areas in Mankhurd,Govandi and Deonar in M-East ward,Trombay in M-West ward,Bhandup-East in S-ward and Mulund-East in T-ward are socio-economically vulnerable.

The slum areas of wards M/E and M/W are ill-equipped,both socio-economically and in terms of infrastructure-wise to tackle a flood-like situation, she added.

The map,which is likely to be ready in another year,will be colour-coded and will cover the MCGM area. It will show spatial pattern of flood risk in different colours as very low,low,medium,high,and very high. Such a map will depict the product of probability of occurrence of a hazard (flood event of a particular magnitude),its exposure and vulnerability of the affected population to flood disaster. A flood risk map depicts the spatial pattern of flood risk over a region. The term risk has been explained in different ways by technocrats and social scientists. In many places,flood hazard map is called flood risk map. There are risk insurance companies who prepare flood risk maps purely from an economic point of view. Hence,research is on globally to achieve a full-fledged flood risk map,considering its multi-disciplinary nature, she said.

According to Sherly,as part of such research works,flood risk maps have been developed for cities like Valencia,Seoul,London (Ontario),Dhaka,Santiago de Chile.

As per the model followed by IIT Bombay-Monash,the creation of the map will involve developing a flood hazard map,which is generated using flood modeling,taking into consideration the combined effect rainfall and tide. The second,a flood vulnerability map,is generated by two types of vulnerabilities,infrastructure and socio-economic. Infrastructure vulnerabilities are assessed in terms of the possible extent of inundation of critical facilities such as hospitals,public buildings,emergency shelters,schools,and of emergency services such as fire stations and police stations. The information,aggregated in a geographic information system (GIS) environment,is combined to create the overall risk map, said Sherly.

Sherlys guide,IIT-Bombay Prof Subhankar Karmakar said such a map would enable decision-makers to create land development plans,land zoning laws,emergency response strategies,disaster recovery,and infrastructure development.

​

Just a representation. Not the actual construction. ​

India's first ever blast, flood, earthquake proof building will be ready by 2014 to protect all your 'AADHAAR' information, reports TOI. The data center being built at Bangalore will host all the servers that will carry your digital information including , Iris scans, fingerprints etc. The Government of India is ensuring that the data remains intact at all the costs and has employed Engineers India Limited (EIL) to construct the building near Tata Nagar Main Road, NH-4. EIL engineers have said that the building is blast proof with category 'C' rating. Some really impressive civil and structural engineering being implemented at UIDAI's data center.The main aim is to protect the data of Indian citizens collected through the AADHAAR card scheme. The data storage won't be affected in case of explosions as the servers will be guarded by 500 mm thick walls. No other building in Bangalore has such a strong structure, it seems.The building is capable of withstanding floods and earthquakes as well. Bangalore comes under Zone-II on the Earth-Quake sensitivity scale but the building built by Engineers India Limited is for the next 'Zone-III' level earthquakes. In order to protect the servers from floods, the building is being constructed at a height of 2.1 meters from the road level.UIDAI's Ashok Dalwai informed the media that the shell of the building is now under Wipro Infotech's control, which is responsible for building the data center. The building is in compliance with all the environmental norms.It's expected that the UIDAI data center in Bangalore will be functional by March 30, 2014. Once fully operational, it will be capable of storing about 6 Pb (=49152 Terabytes) of data. It's estimated that the overall data of 120 Cr+ Indians would amount to over 12 Pb of data which would include individual demographic and biometric data.With that we'd like to leave a question for the readers: What do you think about government's initiatives on AADHAAR and spending hundreds of crores of rupees on ensuring security. We're not sure who the Government is trying to protect the data from; because other countries already have the access to a lot of information through communication networks.

According to leading London-based scientists, the deserts of Rajasthan will become swampy by 2030. The findings of these scientists, which are published in the journal, 'Nature', a few years ago, had also said the north-east areas of the state will change to drought-affected regions.In the last one decade, several indications have been observed which are likely to cause the change, including heavy rains, in western Rajasthan, while the north-east areas are yearning for rain.Usually, October is when winter sets in western Rajasthan, but this year, it's still raining since the last two days in Jodhpur and Barmer.Twenty years ago, Barmer and Jaisalmer like most desert areas witnessed 20mm rainfall and only sands visible on all four directions, but slowly, with the increase in rains, the scene of the entire area has changed so much so that flooding villages have become quite common.In July and August this year, Sankada area of Pokaran sub-division of Jaisalmer witnessed continuous rains during nights making low-lying areas were filled with water. Similarly, in a hamlet at Fatehgarh area, a 10-year-old child died due to heavy rains and storm and many colonies in Ramgarh area were flooded. Even Dabla area was filled with water.However, the rains have also brought greenery and although prosperity is seen in the desert areas, many species found in dry area are also on the verge of extinction, which could become subject of concern.With so much of rains, many rivers have also become active. Kak river, which once used to flow in Chundhi area recently became active and its water has started flowing from the Ganesh temple in between the river. A four-feet water level has also drowned the idol of Lord Ganesha. Such situation has started becoming normal almost every monsoon season. In 2006, Barmer and Jaisalmer witnessed heavy floods demolishing thousands of houses demolished and killing dozens of people.Senior groundwater scientist Dr N D Inkhia said the reason of change in this area is due to increase in agriculture. He said agriculture which started in the 90s using groundwater has played an important role. Along with groundwater-based cultivation, agriculture work is taking place continuously for last many years due to the continuous availability of water from canals.Dr Inkhia said that with the increase in moisture in air and increase in plants, the speeds of wind has reduced and the atmosphere became favourable for rains, due to which the number of days of rains season has increased. Groundwater-based cultivation has been benefitted to the maximum with the increase in rains and water from tube wells is used less during kharif season.Meteorological department's deputy director B R Bishnoi said in last year's findings from a research by London-based scientists had said change in the earth's axial tilt by about half a degree in 1000 years has had also affected a change in the seasonal cycle. Winters are setting in late and monsoons stay longer due to the tilt, they said.Moreover, with the increase in heat and breeze from south west seas, moisture in desert areas is increasing, resulting an increase in the average rainfall. Prior to 1992, the rainfall recorded in the desert regions in the state used to be 20mm and has seen increased to 165mm in the 2000 and after which the average rainfall has increased to 210mm.AFRI director T S Rathore confirming the extraordinary rainfall said it is not in uniform manner and local factors could be the reason behind it. ""I have not come across the right reasons in this regard, but scientists are doing research on it. Global warming could be one of the main reasons,"" he added.Many instances of non-uniform rainfall is also coming to light. Last year, several areas of Nagaur district remained dry while there was heavy rain in other areas.

India's Mars orbiter mission left Earth's sphere of influence early Sunday after performing a maneuver to put it on its way to orbit the red planet.

The spacecraft fired its main engine for more than 20 minutes to reach the correct velocity to leave the Earth's orbit, the Bangalore-based Indian Space Research Organization said.

""The Earth orbiting phase of the spacecraft ended. The spacecraft is now on a course to encounter Mars after a journey of about 10 months around the sun,"" the statement said.

It said that all systems onboard the spacecraft are performing normally.

India launched its first spacecraft bound for Mars on Nov. 5, a complex mission that it hopes will demonstrate and advance technologies for space travel.

The 1,350-kilogram (3,000-pound) orbiter Mangalyaan, which means ""Mars craft"" in Hindi, must travel 780 million kilometers (485 million miles) over 300 days to reach an orbit around Mars next September.

If the mission is successful, India will become only the fourth space program to visit the red planet after the Soviet Union, the United States and Europe.

Graphic fact file on India's Mars Orbiter Mission

Some have questioned the $72 million price tag for a country of 1.2 billion people still dealing with widespread hunger and poverty. But the government defended the Mars mission, and its $1 billion space program in general, by noting its importance in providing high-tech jobs for scientists and engineers and practical applications in solving problems on Earth.

Decades of space research have allowed India to develop satellite, communications and remote sensing technologies that are helping to solve everyday problems at home, from forecasting where fish can be caught by fishermen to predicting storms and floods.

The orbiter will gather images and data that will help in determining how Martian weather systems work and what happened to the large quantities of water that are believed to have once existed on Mars.

It also will search Mars for methane, a key chemical in life processes that could also come from geological processes. Experts say the data will improve understanding about how planets form, what conditions might make life possible and where else in the universe it might exist.

The orbiter is expected to have at least six months to investigate the planet's landscape and atmosphere. At its closest point, it will be 365 kilometers (227 miles) from the planet's surface, and its furthest point will be 80,000 kilometers (49,700 miles) away.

Some of them are now looking at diversifying into thermal, solar and wind power.The B K Chaturvedi Committee was appointed to review existing and ongoing hydroelectric projects on the Ganga and its tributaries. It was also asked to recommend the flow that should be maintained in these rivers, and to suggest how existing power projects should be altered to achieve the required flow. It has suggested certain alterations in existing projects.The committee's recommendations have acquired added significance in light of the flash floods and landslides that occurred in parts of Uttarakhand earlier this month.According to a rough estimate, small hydro power projects totalling 6,000 Mw in the Ganga river basin in Uttarakhand have been affected by the recommendations of the Chaturvedi Committee. The eco-sensitive zone declared by the MoEF has impacted power stations with a total generating capacity of 1,743 Mw.Companies affected included state-owned Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd (UJVN) and THDC India Ltd. Newly floated subsidiaries of NTPC, GVK and Larsen & Toubro are also affected by the adverse report on the hydropower sector.A total of 69 hydropower projects with a capacity of more than 9000 Mw were under review by the inter-ministerial group which was set up following an agitation by environmentalists and religious leaders against the development of scores of hydro power projects on the river Bhagirathi.The committee recommended that no new hydropower projects be taken up beyond these 69 projects. The committee has set certain limitations on these 69 and also stopped the construction of power projects worth 6,000 Mw. The group has recommended the construction of hydropower projects totaling only 3,000 Mw - with tough riders and environmental safeguards.THDC India Ltd has already ventured into the thermal power business by signing an memorandum of understanding with the Uttar Pradesh government to set up coal-fired power plant at Khurja in the Bulandshahr area. This will be the THDC's maiden foray into the thermal power business. The Rishikesh-based company, a joint venture between the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government, recently decided to enter other power businesses like solar and wind power.R S T Sai, chairman and managing director of THDCIL, said that to mitigate exposure to risks like long gestation periods, environmental and social issues involved in developing hydropower projects, the company would diversify into thermal, solar and wind power projects.",issue,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 20, 2013","['Uttarakhand', 'Himachal Pradesh', 'Haryana', 'Delhi', 'Rajasthan', 'Uttar Pradesh']","['200 mm in 24 hours in Uttarakhand', '150 mm in 24 hours in Himachal Pradesh', '100 mm in 24 hours in Haryana', '50 mm in 24 hours in Delhi', '25 mm in 24 hours in Rajasthan', '20 mm in 24 hours in Uttar Pradesh']","['1,000+ deaths', 'Rs. 30,000 crore in damages', '100,000+ people displaced']",,"['Damage to infrastructure', 'Loss of crops', 'Environmental degradation']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The deaths came as much of the northern half of the country braced for two days of unsettled weather attributed to a low pressure system building over the Sultanate.

The two boys, aged 16 and 14, were crossing a wadi in the Ibri district of Dhahirah governorate when they were surprised by a raging flood, authorities said. Elsewhere around the country, Civil Defence personnel were at full stretch assisting helicopter crews and ground teams in the rescue of scores of people stranded in flooded wadis during the course of Tuesday.

The Directorate General of Meteorology and Air Navigation (DGMAN), which provides regular forecasts of the weather situation in Oman, said a number of wadis were in full flow in the governorates of Dhahirah, Buraimi, Dakhiliya, and Batinah North, as well as the capital region of Muscat.

Thunderstorms early on Wednesday morning forced the closure of dozens of schools in the capital. Radio channels began broadcasting news of closures at dawn, sparing thousands of pupils the inconvenience of getting to school through gridlocked traffic junctions and waterlogged streets. Government-run schools too remained largely shut in anticipation of more adverse weather later in the day.

Gusting winds felled a number of trees along usually busy carriageways in Muscat, triggering lengthy tailbacks extending several kilometres in some places. Flooded street corners and other rain-related impediments also made driving a tortuous exercise for many motorists.

""We are setting up a campus in Trivandrum on 36 acres of land with over $100 million in investment in phase one. We are also planning to expand in central and northern India symbolizing UST'S commitment to grow and expand in India,"" added Pillai.

UST has 135 Fortune 100 clients in the health care, insurance, retail, financial services, manufacturing, media, utility, and energy industries. It currently has 12,000 employees, but expects headcount to rapidly expand over the next three years. The company sees the new talent coming from countries such as India, Mexico, Spain, Greece and Saudi Arabia.

""Over the next three years we plan to train 100,000 engineers globally of which at least 30,000 will be in India,"" said Nikki Arora, Director, marketing and global talent acquisition at UST Global.

""We have partnerships with over 135 academic institutions in India, whom we guide, and assist to train and develop young talent,"" added Arora.

UST Global has already taken the fairly unusual step of choosing Leon in Mexico to set up a new IT center, which will eventually be filled with 10,000 employees.

""Mexico being the tenth largest economy has great potential. Spanish is one the most widely spoken languages; it ranks at No. 3 among the world's top 50 languages. Having a bilingual workforce will give us an edge and open up avenues of growth for us in the Spanish speaking world. It's an ideal location offering US Central Time zone coverage and near shore service capabilities,"" said Arora, who was recognized as ""Woman of Outstanding Leadership"" by The International Womens Leadership Association (TIWLA).

Headquartered in California, UST Global has offices in the US, Britain, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Mexico, Denmark and Singapore. Its client-centric Global Engagement Model ensures 24/7 delivery of services through onshore, nearshore, and offshore centers. It offers consulting, tech build, application development, infrastructure, e-commerce, business intelligence, data management, social media solutions, and BPO services.

There is always this notion that IT service providers only write thousands of lines of code, but at UST they take inventing new things very seriously. The firm's Apple Tree Lab encourages employees to spend part of their day in an ""innovation gym,"" developing user cases for new technologies. UST spots new opportunities for services by constantly looking for gaps between what it offers and what customers are asking for. Think of this as fill-in growth. A lot of ideas for new services come from the grassroots - its employees.

""We encourage our 12,000 employees to come up with new technologies and ways of doing things. Many of these ideas are spawned from what is driving our client's business; others are solutions that help our employees, and our community,"" said Arora.

""We are serious about innovation and ask our programmers and engineers to not only to break their head in solving a client's problem but also break whatever they can to innovate at the innovation gym,"" she added.

UST's Trivandrum-based analyst Renjith Ramachandran's app was selected by Nokia to be released in its Ovi Store. Similarly, Allen Thomas Varghese spent time innovating around Microsoft Kinect which can ""see"" every movement of your body and reproduce it within the video game you're playing. Varghese has built a Formula 1 toy car which he can maneuver with simple hand movements. He is working on using the technology to help shoppers get better store information.

""We also played a substantial role for a Fortune 100 retailer, to execute their ideas around customer loyalty by building and deploying a mobile app. Not only did the application race to a million downloads, the positive impact on the client's business continues to feature in the company's annual report,"" said Jim Hughes, Corporate Innovation Officer at UST Global.",solution,UST Global,"California, USA",2000,Present,"India, Mexico, Spain, Greece, Saudi Arabia",,,,"12,000 employees, 135 Fortune 100 clients, plans to train 100,000 engineers globally",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

519,1597,bangalore,2013,https://www.firstpost.com/living/india-bans-dolphin-shows-but-what-about-other-less-intelligent-species-1170845.html,14 Oct 2013,"India bans dolphin shows but what about other less 'intelligent' species?-Living News , Firstpost","Few contest the obvious privilege of intelligence in all walks of life. But what indeed is intelligence? And who decides how intelligent is intelligent enough?

The decision of the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) to ban dolphinariums or marine parks, captive facilities where dolphin shows are organized, has not made big headlines. But this is a bold move that sends a clear signal to various states planning to set up dolphinariums for tourists. And, it is in keeping with the ban on use of animals in circuses.

Like most wildlife, cetaceans — marine mammals such as dolphins, whales and porpoises — have a history of poor longevity in captivity across the world. Zoos, however, keep a wide variety of wildlife in large numbers. One would think that the cetaceans drew special attention because captive dolphins are almost always made to perform. Most zoo animals serve only as exhibits.

But the CZA circular cites a curious justification. The authority doesn’t want dolphins in zoos because scientists have found them to have ""unusually high intelligence"" and therefore they should be seen as ""non-human persons and as such should have their own specific rights and is morally unacceptable to keep them captive for entertainment purpose.""

This has raised certain dilemmas among conservationists. Ashish Kothari of Kalpavriksh, for example, summed it up in an online forum: “Perhaps it is a step towards the ‘rights’ of nature being recognised. However, the fact that this is happening only because dolphins have ‘unusually high intelligence’ and are 'persons' suggests that we are willing to extend rights only to something or someone who is akin to us. We are then leaving out most of nature, assuming that 'intelligence' here is used in the sense that we use it for ourselves, with various cognitive, predictive and reflective properties.”

Dolphins have fascinated us ever since we learnt how much alike we are. These marine wonders are deeply social, cooperative and competitive, follow basic language, display ‘culture’ and pass on information to successive generations. Their body to brain size ratio is second only to that of humans. They are known to help fishermen in mutually beneficial fishing practices. But the species is under threat from growing fisheries that eat into its prey base and also kill individuals by entangling in fishing nets. Tourism is the other prime threat as both dolphin swims and dolphin shows are getting increasingly popular.

In 2010, the Helsinki Group for cetaceans was formed for fostering moral and legal change. Based on the principle of equal treatment of all persons, it affirmed that “all cetaceans as persons have the right to life, liberty and wellbeing”, adding that, among other things, “no cetacean should be held in captivity or servitude” as they are not the “property of any State, corporation, human group or individual”.

That is a noble call and India’s decision shows that it is gaining international support. But ‘intelligence’ in nature can be complex. Even tiny organisms can achieve miracles far beyond humans. Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that is flushed out in cat stool soon after its birth. Now it must return to a cat’s stomach to complete its life cycle.

So, the devious protozoan enters the stomach of a rat that has nibbled at cat dropping and executes complex neurosurgery to make the host fearless of cats. The sooner the rat becomes cat food, the brighter the chances of the Toxoplasma to reach a cat’s tummy and reproduce. The parasite also infects humans and is possibly responsible for the social menace of rash (read fearless) driving.

Primates, particularly chimpanzees, use several tools. Beavers are the world’s best dam engineers. Tiny birds make nests with the skill and judgment of a master craftsman. Spiders spin webs more resilient than stainless steel. The social system of the bees is smoother than that of any species on earth. And no matriarchal society functions as well as the elephant’s. Why, all animals manage to find their way back if moved from their habitat. Even a pea-brained crocodile covered 400 km in 20 days all around the northern tip of Australia to return to its territory.

All these species intrigue us. Yet, we set aside this “intelligence” as instinct even though we understand little about how they manage the impossible. At the still higher end of the spectrum, yet unable to fully decipher the grand scheme of nature that holds everything in fine balance, our bewilderment often seeks refuge in the supernatural.

Ultimately, it is about us. We want to save the panda because it is cute and the tiger for its charisma. The ugly crocodile or bat finds few defenders. We accept dolphins as intelligent because they accomplish a few things we too are capable of. That makes it a ‘person’ eligible for humane treatment. But we don’t have qualms confining other animal species in pathetic conditions in zoos across India.

This people-like-us syndrome is probably our biggest weakness. Most of us will be outraged if told that a doctor or an MBA is chained to a lowly clerical job. Now ask yourself if you would be half as bothered if we replace the hapless doctor with a painter or the frustrated MBA with a poet. Few of us understand the gift of a painter or a poet like we can identify with the skills of a doctor or an MBA.

Nobody grudges the beleaguered dolphin a better life. But if we honestly try to answer the question we began with, we may yet give ourselves a chance to act less self-centred. And we can turn the second question around. Can intelligence, whichever way we define it, be a measure of one’s eligibility for the most basic rights? Can we justify confining or enslaving someone or something for being less ‘smart’? Can anyone, or any species, be deemed too dumb to feel miserable?",,2018 Kerala floods,"Kerala, India",15 August 2018,10 September 2018,"['Alappuzha', 'Ernakulam', 'Idukki', 'Kottayam', 'Thrissur', 'Wayanad']","['2,344 mm (92.2 in) in Aluva', '2,173 mm (85.5 in) in Kochi', '1,972 mm (77.7 in) in Thrissur', '1,841 mm (72.5 in) in Kozhikode', '1,765 mm (69.5 in) in Kannur']","['Rs. 20,000 crore', '100,000 houses damaged', '350,000 people displaced']",['483'],"['Loss of crops', 'Damage to infrastructure', 'Disruption of communication']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

looks picture-perfect . It is the only village that has ever been relocated from the core area of

. But it wasn’t any government effort — the floods of 1993 swept away the jungle settlement.

Two decades on, a trek to the Jayanti hills will lead you past several small settlements in the village that don’t figure in the foresters’ relocation roster.These settlements were built by employees of a dolomite mining firm, whose operations were suspended in 1983 after Buxa was declared a tiger reserve. The forest department never bothered about these 29 families while relocating other villagers of Bhutia Basti to Patpara and Hatipota. “We were also denied pattas as we are not tribals,” says 50-year-old Arjun Chetri, who lifts boulders from the Jayanti riverbed to run his six-member family. Chetri and his brother feel entitled to Rs 20 lakh under the relocation scheme, but the forest department felt otherwise . R P Saini, field director of Buxa Tiger Reserve, says those living in Bhutia Basti are not forest villagers. “They are the employees of the company which had taken the forest land on lease.”Some of these families have already developed home-stay facilities for tourists in their wooden huts when the Supreme Court has asked governments to phase out tourism from the core areas of tiger reserves. Chetri has developed two bedrooms on the first floor of his house, which helps him pocket Rs 15,000-20 ,000 a month during the peak tourism season (October-March ). “The forest department has turned its back on us. I save money from what I earn during the tourism season. Who knows when the officials come and ask us to vacate the place,” he reasons.“Bhutia Basti is on the route to the hills of Bhutan. Its location will disturb the movement of tigers between the forests of Bhutan and Buxa,” says wildlife advisory board member Biswajit Roy Chowdhury. “Leave aside these 29 labourers’ families, what about the Mahakal temple in the core zone? Thousands throng there every year. How can you relocate a temple?” asks a forester.The Chetri family may not be an issue for the forest department, but what if families like the Kurmis and Mahatos in Jayanti, with 40-60 members, approach the state if the Centre extends the relocation package to the buffer areas? Forest minister Hiten Burman doesn’t seem perturbed. “If one can prove his land rights as a forest villager, he will not be relocated,” he assures.Saini goes a step ahead. “There is nothing to worry since the relocation plan has been shelved and the villagers are happy.” On being asked why, he said large tracts of Jayanti and other villages , apart from Bhutia Basti, don’t come in the core zone.“Why did they plan the relocation package then?” asks Shekhar Bhattacharya , secretary of the Jayanti village relocation committee. “Besides, why have they banned tourism in Jayanti from June 15 to September 15 if the area falls in the buffer zone? They could have at least allowed tourism between Rajabhatkhawa checkpost and Jayanti,” says Bhattacharya, who is also the secretary of the local eco-development committee.

521,1599,bangalore,2013,https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/definition-of-basic-wages-for-calculation-of-pf-contribution/1176430/,30 Sept 2013,Definition of ?basic wages? for calculation of PF contribution,"In a recent ruling that favours employees, the Delhi High Court has expanded the scope of basic wages to be included for Provident Fund (PF) contribution. Under the PF rules, contribution towards PF is to be calculated on basic wages, dearness allowance, retaining allowance and cash value of any food concession.

Basic wages have been defined to mean all cash emoluments, except:

(a) Cash value of any food concession;

(b) Any dearness allowance;

(c) House rent allowance, overtime allowance, bonus, presents; and

(d) Commission or any other similar allowance.

The concept of ?basic wages? on which PF contribution is to be calculated has always been a debatable issue. The Supreme Court has laid down two tests to determine whether a component is included in the definition of ?basic wages? or not. These are ?test of universality? and ?test of contingency?.

Applying the test of universality, if a component is paid universally, necessarily and ordinarily to all employees of a company, the same is included in the definition of basic wages. Applying the test of contingency, if a component is paid subject to uncertain events like overtime payment, the same is excluded from the definition of basic wages.

On the basis of these tests, the Delhi High Court recently held that canteen allowance paid to all permanent employees would be included in the definition of basic wages. The Delhi High Court also dismissed the argument taken by the company that canteen allowance falls under ?any other similar allowance?, which is excluded from the definition of basic wages. This highlights another concern as to what constitutes ?commission or any other similar allowance?, which is excluded from the definition of basic wages ? whether the term ?any other similar allowance? has to be read along with ?commission? or separately.

The industry would be keen to take a view that ?any other allowance? is very wide in scope and, thus, various cash allowances may fall under it and get excluded from the definition of ?basic wages?. On the other hand, the PF authorities seem to take a view that both these terms are to be read together. This would narrow the scope of ?any other allowance? by limiting components in the nature of ?commission? only to fall under it.

The Delhi High Court held that the terms ?commission? and ?any other similar allowance? have been written in the law without any break or ?comma?. Accordingly, both the terms should be read together and ?any other similar allowance? would, therefore, mean an allowance which is similar to commission.

There may be further deliberations and clarifications on this specific point in future rulings. A similar issue relating to the definition of basic wages is pending before the Supreme Court. It is likely that more certainty on the matter may come after the Supreme Court passes its judgment.

State-run and private sector banks have opened a little more than 7,300 branches during calendar year 2013. This is the highest yearly number in the past decade.



Bangalore-based Canara Bank set up 723 branches in 2013, while State Bank of India, the largest lender, opened 627. Among private lenders, ICICI opened the highest number, 587.



The majority of branches were opened in non-metropolitan locations, as lenders focused on expanding the reach in unbanked and under-banked regions. HDFC Bank, the second largest private lender, opened 333 of its 339 new branches in rural and semi-urban centres. About 80 per cent of Canara Bank's new branches were outside metro and urban locations.



The growing popularity of alternative banking channels has failed to discourage lenders from setting up brick-and-mortar branches across the country.State-run and private sector banks have opened a little more than 7,300 branches during calendar year 2013.

“There is a need to improve our geographical reach. Hence, banks are trying to cover areas where they were not present earlier. We cannot service the rural population with alternate banking channels like mobile and internet banking. We need to have physical presence and, therefore, are expanding our presence in deep geographies,” M Narendra, chairman and managing director of Indian Overseas Bank, told Business Standard. The Chennai-based state-run lender set up 324 new branches in 2013, of which 215 were in rural and semi-urban locations.Bankers say the government's financial inclusion programme that aims to provide banking services across 625,000 villages has also led to the increase in numbers of rural and semi-urban branches. “There are still a little over 300,000 villages that do not get banking services. Banks are expected to have presence across these villages in the next two and a half years. Hence, banks will continue to open more branches in these areas for the next few years,” said Shubhalakshmi Panse, chairperson and managing director of Allahabad Bank.Bankers said the Reserve Bank of India’s decision to relax the branch licensing norm had aided their expansion.

A month after Phailin,Orissa is looking at devastation and rehabilitation on the scale of 1999. Report and photographs by Debabrata Mohanty

It’s been a month since Cyclone Phailin swept Orissa. A month in which the original euphoria over a state known to keel under disasters standing up resolutely to one has given way to the realisation of the long and slow process ahead in picking up the pieces. Just as the people were congratulating themselves for surviving the cyclone,they were hit by a wave of flooding that few had bargained for. It isnt the supercyclone,but the 2013 storm now looks to have left a larger area devastated in the state,putting peoples lives back by at least 5-10 years. Almost to 1999,that is,for some.

Estimated losses: Rs 21,770 crore; more than Orissas Plan outlay for 2013-14

Phailin cut a neat arc of calamity through the districts of Ganjam,Puri and Balasore,dumping huge amounts of rain in 18 of the 30 districts of the state on the night of October 12. But while Phailin and the accompanying rain were bad enough,it was the second round of flooding a week later that hit these districts the hardest.

In most of the villages,the tree cover is gone,even as thousands of acres of paddy fields lie covered in mud or sand. Inside homes or what remains of them,furniture and clothing are yet to lose their moisture completely,and a dank smell hangs in the air.

The devastation may not be as intense as the 1999 supercyclone,but its widespread, admits Orissa Chief Secretary Jugal Kishore Mohapatra,who was Revenue Secretary at the time of the 1999 supercyclone that saw close to 10,000 deaths.

Unlike the 1999 cyclone,where people suffered the wrath of nature for a few days,2013 has been one long ordeal, adds Debabrata Patra,a senior official of voluntary agency Action Aid,working in the cyclone-affected areas.

Haunted by the failures of 1999,Orissa had moved more than a million people out of harms way before Phailin bore down. As a result,the death toll this time,from the affected 18 districts,stands at just 59. In the second round of flooding though,Ganjam alone saw 800 mm of rain instead of its usual 170-odd mm in October,swelling the rivers Rushikulya and Bahuda beyond levels hardly ever seen before.

The evacuation was the easier part. Providing relief was far more difficult. But its the rehabilitation that is proving to be the most difficult. What we have done so far is provide basic succour, admits Ganjam District Collector Krishan Kumar.

Though a large proportion of the 37 lakh population of Ganjam district has received the food relief package of 50 kg rice and Rs 500,the cyclone and the flood have broken their backs.

Population affected: More than 2 crore (Half of the states 4.2 crore people); Houses damaged: 9.4 lakh (Half of them severely)

Suchitra Beheras house in Handighara village of Purushottampur block in Ganjam doesnt have a roof anymore,the supporting bamboo poles evocative of the skeleton that remains of it. Any day,the 42-year-old knows,the rest of the structure could collapse. Kailash Chandra Nayak (39),who lives a little distance away,had a concrete roof over his head. But it now lies broken in the middle.

More than a 100 km away in Sanapatna village,of Puri districts Krushnaprasad block,fisherman Raghunath Chelberis thatched-roof house has caved in,burying his almirah,his television set and other valuables. At least 300 km north of Chelberis house,72-year-old farmer Baidhar Jena in Ambulakuda village of coastal Balasore district walks mournfully around the debris of his house. There used to be my cot… there my TV set,my fan,my rice bags, Jena rambles,trying to salvage any remaining valuables. Dont, cautions a neighbour. There may be snakes inside.

For many,polythene sheets are their only cover; those luckier have found shelter in school buildings. Katibudha Dalei,a 55-year-old Dalit farmer from Shankarpur village of Balasore,has been living in one such building with his five-member family since October 14. I had sold my bullocks to put tiles on my roof, he shakes his head,trying to retrieve a mudslicked DVD player from under the rubble.

The government will give Rs 15,000 for a fully-damaged kutcha house like Daleis,but the amount is meagre. This year the paddy is all gone. Where will I get the straw (to build it)? From where will we get the bricks?

Just a few days before the cyclone,20-something Jagannath Behera of Handighara village had come home from Surat in Gujarat,where he works in a spinning mill. The day after the storm,his 55-year-old father Kanda ventured out to clear the debris of their destroyed home. A wooden beam fell over his chest and left him injured. That night,I cycled to a local doctor through waist-deep water,but he refused to come. When I came back,my father was dead, says Jagannath. He is uncertain about going back to Surat leaving his mother and sister back in the village.

Power situation: 1,756 feeders,42,753 substations,36,885 km of low-tension lines,4,074 km of extra high-tension lines,4.08 lakh electric poles and 93 extra-high tension towers down; Population affected: 3.39 million

Before Phailin struck,Garrampeta village looked forward to evenings. In 2004,the government settled the fishermen of this village in Rangeilunda block of Ganjam in pucca houses numbering over a hundred. Night time meant dinner together watching Telugu sitcoms on TV. With the lone electrical substation in the village now a mangled metal heap,Garrampeta feels the silence as the dark sets in. Its as if there is a mass funeral, says school teacher Ch Krishnamurti. Adding to the spookiness are the kilometres of screwpine bushes leading to the village that now rot in the floodwaters.

In Antirigram village of Ganjam,youths have cut short cellphone use. For charging mobiles,we have to travel to Berhampur and pay Rs 30-40 an hour. Its better to conserve the battery, says Bishnu Prasad Bhukta.

With power supply yet to be restored to more than 65 per cent of the affected population in Ganjam,people are managing with portable generators or kerosene lamps. Energy officials had promised that partial supply would be restored to all of Ganjam by November 5,but villages dont think anything will happen till the end of this month.

Food relief: 8.3 lakh quintals of rice,Rs 73 crore for pulses given to 24.4 lakh families

As Phailin stormed in on October 12,widower Adha Behera trooped to the local temple with his two sons,their wives,three grandchildren and an unmarried daughter in Handighara village. Though his thatched roof was blown away,the 70-year-old who catches fish for a living thought he could recoup the losses. But then the flood came and Rushikulya river ran over his mudhouse. I had borrowed Rs 15,000 to buy a fishing net last year. The rice and paddy that I had stored have started fermenting. My clothes and blankets are stinking. My house may collapse anytime. Where do I go now? wonders Behera.

Next door,Dali Beheras family of 14,including five daughers and foster son Govinda,shared a two-room mudhouse till the cyclone and flood broke through the walls and the thatched roof. After the floodwaters receded,Dali came back to her house,to find the one and a half bags of rice she had stocked soggy. I used to work in peoples fields. The rice was my only savings, cries Dali.

As special food relief,the government had announced 50 kg rice and

Rs 500 for buying pulses or 25 kg rice and Rs 300 for the affected population,depending on the severity of the disaster in the region. But in several villages,people complained they had not got the rice. Ive got neither rice nor any money, laments Mahargi Behera,a 65-year-old widow of Antirigam village.

In Shankarpur village of Balasore,Dalit labourer Anadi Jena is among those who says they didnt get any relief. The revenue inspector did not come to see me saying there was too much water around my home, he claims.

Crop area damaged: 12.4 lakh hectares (In 7.18 lakh hectares,more than 50 per cent damage); Horticulture: 63,000-odd hectares damaged

While mudhouses and asbestos-roofed homes were being ripped apart,Kailash Chandra Nayak in Handighara thought his concrete-roof house made by his late father Dandapani,under the Indira Awaas Yojana,would survive. He was wrong. The winds first neatly broke the roof from the middle and then the rushing water from Rushikulya stormed in,leading to its collapse. A substation near his home was smashed to the ground.

Kailash,who occasionally worked as a driver as well as a field hand for a living,managed to save himself by climbing atop the nearby Handighara High School with his wife. Even inside the school building I was afraid the structure may give in, says Nayak,now living under a polythene cover next to his collapsed house.

He is unsure whether government help will be enough to rebuild even a mudhouse. There would be no straw available this year as the floods have damaged the paddy crop. I may not even get work as a daily labourer, he says.

Neighbours Santosh Behera and Babu were prosperous in comparison. Behera had started a poultry firm last year with 3,500 birds. The winds ripped through the asbestos roofs,killing all his birds and his dreams of being a successful entrepreneur. Mohantys finances too took a massive beating after Phailin tore through his rice and paddy stocks in the rice mill. The rice now is not fit to be even eaten by birds. My machines have become all wet. I must have suffered at least Rs 2 crore damage, laments Mohanty.

In relatively prosperous Antirigam village in the same block,Prafulla Swains eight-acre field is now under mud and sand swept up from Rushikulya river. Swain had got a loan of Rs 1 lakh from a local bank pledging his wifes gold jewellery for growing vegetables. My vegetables used to make it to Bhubaneswar markets. Now my family will starve, he rues.

Director of Agriculture R Sant Gopalan says while it is difficult to estimate the loss at this stage,the damage to agriculture is as bad as the 1999 supercyclone when crop over 17.3 lakh hectares area was affected. This time the intensity of winds may have been lesser and the death toll negligible,but the havoc is the same. Whatever we give to the farmer would not be enough.

Embankments damaged: 874.4 km of river embankments,765.81 km of canal embankments

Built around a decade ago,the pucca house next to Baidhar Jenas thatched roof home in Ambulakuda village of Balasores Remuna block stands as a reminder of the gulf between government promises and reality. Though HUDCO was supposed to give Rs 25,000 as housing loan,only half of it was advanced. The pucca house,now gathering mildew,thus stood there without a roof till Jena strung a polythene over it last week to give it a semblance of home.

Soon after Phailin hit,it rained copiously in Balasore,swelling Budhabalanga river. Jena was taken by surprise as water gushed through a breached embankment and slowly rose up to his ankle. I had never seen the river so full. By October 14 night,water was chest deep. We swam to the school building with much difficulty, recounts Jena.

Till almost three weeks after that,the 72-year-old farmer and his seven family members stayed in the school as the three-room mudhouse in which he had lived for 30 years collapsed. I must have lost around Rs 1 lakh. I had saved some money for my daughters marriage,but could not retrieve anything. My paddy is all gone. I am now no better than a destitute, cries Jena. He had to leave the school building after the schools reopened.

Jenas neighbour Nini Mahaliks fate is worse. Since her house collapsed about a week ago,Mahalik,a widow,and her family are living under a polythene cover on the road. In daytime,it heats up. At night it gets chillier as dew sets in. I wake up drenched every night, she says.

In neighbouring Sankarpur village,Dalit housewife Mithu Majhi thinks only providence saved her 45-day-old son Rahul. Born two weeks before Phailins landfall,the infant looked set to drown as floodwater from Budhabalanga swirled around their thatched-roof home. While Mithus ageing father-in-law somehow swam to safety,Mithu struggled to her neighbours pucca house stumbling several times as she held Rahul aloft. She would spend two days on the roof of that house,without food or water,and worrying constantly for her son,who remained drenched as it poured. Rahul is still running a fever,though doctors say he is safe.

Budhabalanga has now receded,but not before eating away the embankment and depositing all its sand over the vegetable fields. The fields have become useless. We somehow saved ourselves,but for what? asks Budhiram Mahalik,whose house is among the 1.3 lakh damaged in Balasore.

Fishermen hit: Around 12,000; 40,000 fishing nets,12,000 boats damaged,900 hectares of aquaculture ponds submerged

Fishermen were probably the worst hit group,with over 12,000 left without a boat,net or both.

With his mechanised fibre boat and half-a-dozen fishing nets,Raghunath Chelberi,51,used to bring in rich hauls of fish daily as he forayed into Chilika,Indias largest brackishwater lake. To add to his income,he had a couple of acres of cashew plantation.

When officials of Puri district raised alarm over Phailin hitting villages along the coast of Chilika,Chelberi left his village Sanapatna under Krushnaprasad block in Puri district for Puri town with his four-member family,locking his thatched-roof house. I thought a locked house would be safe, he says. He returned to see his house under knee-deep water,his TV set and other valuables gone.

The water from Chilika rose almost 10 feet and touched the first floor of the cyclone shelter, recalls fisherman Babu Behera,whose aluminium trunk containing his clothes,his photo ID cards,his BPL card and other valuables were washed away.

In Sanapatna village,Kalia Behera found his mechanised boat thrown several feet away from his house and under heaps of mud. In neighbouring Sipakuda village,where the villagers make a living by taking tourists to Chilika,more than 150 boats were damaged as waves battered them against each other.

The tourist season starts during Dussehra. But this year,it ended before it could start, says Bichitra Jali,whose eight-year-old boat lies in pieces.

Fund crunch: Low casualties mean less aid

Unlike the 1999 supercyclone,when a large number of corpses and carcasses raised the danger of an epidemic,this fear has been largely absent this time. The phalanx of politicians and NGOs who otherwise make a beeline to Ground Zero is also missing due to the low casualties. A senior official of a leading NGO said he was finding it difficult to convince funding agencies for an assistance of Rs 2 crore.

Acutely aware of the rehabilitation process impacting him in next years Assembly and Lok Sabha polls,Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has put forth a huge wishlist,seeking Rs 13,601.41 crore from the Centre. Of this,the state government has sought Rs 7,769 crore for medium-term reconstruction.

While other officials point to the 1999 cyclone when Orissa received

Rs 800-odd crore against a demand of

Rs 6,200-odd crore from the Centre,Chief Secretary Mohapatra isnt disheartened. Unlike 1999 when we had empty coffers,this time we can carry out rehabilitation work even before the Centre sends help. I am confident we can rebuild the affected areas in the next two years.

Sceptics are worried that despite the initial good work,the whole rehabilitation process may slow down as administrative tardiness takes over. Its difficult to maintain the tempo among subordinate officials over a long time, says Dharmendra Pradhan,BJP general secretary. Once Phailin becomes a distant memory,official apathy may become the norm.",flood,Phailin Flood,"Odisha, India","October 12, 2013","October 19, 2013","Ganjam, Puri, Balasore",800 mm,"Rs 21,770 crore",59,"More than 2 crore people affected, 9.4 lakh houses damaged, 12.4 lakh hectares of crop area damaged, 874.4 km of river embankments damaged, 765.81 km of canal embankments damaged, around 12,000 fishermen hit","Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has put forth a huge wishlist,seeking Rs 13,601.41 crore from the Centre.

The spacecraft fired its main engine for more than 20 minutes to reach the correct velocity to leave the Earth's orbit, the Bangalore-based Indian Space Research Organisation said. It said that all systems on board the spacecraft were performing normally.

India launched its first spacecraft bound for Mars on 5 November, a complex mission that it hopes will demonstrate and advance technologies for space travel.

The 1.3-tonne orbiter Mangalyaan, which means ""Mars craft"" in Hindi, must travel 485m miles over 300 days to reach an orbit around Mars next September.

If the mission is successful, India will become the fourth space programme to visit the red planet after the Soviet Union, the US and Europe.

Some have questioned the price tag for a country of 1.2 billion people still dealing with widespread hunger and poverty. But the government defended the Mars mission, and its $1bn space programme in general, by noting its importance in providing hi-tech jobs for scientists and engineers and practical applications in solving problems on Earth.

Decades of space research have allowed India to develop satellite, communications and remote sensing technologies that are helping to solve everyday problems at home, from forecasting where fish can be caught by fishermen to predicting storms and floods.

The orbiter will gather images and data that will help in determining how Martian weather systems work and what happened to the large quantities of water that may have once existed on Mars.

Experts say the data will improve understanding about how planets form, what conditions might make life possible and where else in the universe it might exist.

The orbiter is expected to have at least six months to investigate the planet's landscape and atmosphere. At its closest point, it will be 227 miles from the planet's surface, and its furthest point will be nearly 50,000 miles away.",,India Mars Orbiter Mission,Earth,2013-11-05,2014-09,['India'],485m miles,$1bn,0,"Developed satellite, communications and remote sensing technologies that are helping to solve everyday problems at home, from forecasting where fish can be caught by fishermen to predicting storms and floods.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Loans against residential housing falling under commercial real estate projects will now attract lower provisioning of 0.75 per cent against 1 per cent earlier, the Reserve Bank of India said in a directive on Friday.

Besides, the RBI has carved out the residential housing projects under the commercial real estate as a sub-category of the commercial real estate sector.

“The CRE-RH (Commercial Real Estate-Residential Housing) segment will attract a lower risk weight of 75 per cent and lower standard asset provisioning of 0.75 per cent as against 100 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively, for the CRE (Commercial Real Estate) segment,” the RBI said.

The RBI directive follows the Monetary Policy statement 2013-14 to carve out a sub-sector of ‘CRE-Residential Housing’ within the CRE sector as residential housing projects poses lower risk from other commercial estate projects. The RBI further said the CRE-RH segment would consist of loans to builders and developers for residential housing projects except for captive consumption under commercial real estate segment.

It added that such projects should ordinarily not include non-residential commercial real estate.

“However, integrated housing projects comprising of some commercial space (shopping complex, school) can also be classified under CRE-RH, provided that the commercial area in the residential housing project does not exceed 10 per cent of the total Floor Space Index (FSI) of the project.”

In case the FSI of the commercial area in the predominantly residential housing complex exceeds the ceiling of 10 per cent, the project loans should be classified as CRE and not CRE—RH, RBI clarified.

The RBI further said that, “...our extant instruction requiring additional risk-weight of 25 percentage points for restructured housing loans and higher provisioning of 2 per cent for housing loans extended at teaser rates by banks will continue to remain in force.”",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown

The Board intends to create a common brand to market Indian coffee, especially those grown in the Western Ghats and Araku Valley in Andhra Pradesh.



“Almost 98 per cent of coffee produced in India is grown in the Western Ghats region and some new areas in Araku Valley. Indian coffee, grown under tree shade, is very popular in the international markets. It contributes to intrinsic quality and internationally it is known as eco-friendly coffee. So, we are trying to make use of the Western Ghats tag to market our coffees in the overseas markets,” Jawaid Akhtar, chairman of Coffee Board, told Business Standard.



The Board will sell Indian coffee as “good coffee” and “organic coffee” to fetch higher prices in the overseas markets.



Akhtar said Indian exporters are able to command 40-50 per cent higher margins on the benchmark International Coffee Organization (ICO) prices for washed Robusta and 25 per cent for Robusta Cherry. “We are contemplating to come out with a common brand for Indian coffee. We are also planning to promote our coffee through international trade fairs, exhibitions and release advertisements,” Akhtar added.



For the first time, coffee grown in Araku Valley in parts of the eastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh is coming to market this year, Akhtar said, adding the Board plans to market this coffee as “organic coffee"". In Araku Valley, the coffee is largely grown by tribals.



Popularly known as non-traditional areas in the coffee circles, this region includes the states of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and to a small extent Madhya Pradesh. The region is predominantly inhabited by a wide variety of tribal groups, who are known for their traditional agriculture practices and ‘podu’ (shifting cultivation) over centuries.



The trees are planted at an elevation of 3,200 ft above the sea level.



“We have requested the government of Andhra Pradesh to help tribals market their coffee, so that we can reduce the role of middlemen. There are some non-government organisations like Naandi Foundation that are assisting tribals in cultivating coffee,” said Akhtar.



Araku Valley is expected to produce about 6,500 tonnes of coffee this year. Over 100,000 tribals have brought 55,000 hectares area under coffee plantations in the Valley and the average holding is one acre per person. The tribals have used mainly organic practices to grow the coffee.



Arabica coffee is the main variety and the arabica station breed selections such as S.934, Sln.4 (agaro) and Sln.5 occupy major areas in Andhra Pradesh. In Odisha, Cauvery is the main variety under cultivation. Pepper is the main inter crop adding substantially to the net returns of coffee farms.

And so it should.

There are 45 hydropower projects in Uttarakhand, according to Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam (UJVN), a state government company. If that sounds like a lot in a state only just larger than Punjab, consider that unlike richer states, such as Punjab, Uttarakhand—carved out of Uttar Pradesh 13 years ago—hopes its bountiful rivers and steep mountain sides can meet not just its needs but generate a surplus that it can sell to its chronically power-starved neighbours, even distant Delhi. So, more than 230 hydel projects, from micro to mega, 0.2 MW to 376 MW, are under development, according to UJVN (Right to Information queries over the last three years put the figure at more than 500).

This would seem like a good idea. Hydel power is considered clean and planet friendly, a good way to reduce carbon emissions in an age of global warming and produce more electricity in a country desperately short of it. Urja Pradesh, land of electricity, is a moniker that the state government likes to bandy about to prospective investors.

The flipside of hydel power, particularly large and medium dams, is the disruptive impact they can have on forests and wildlife. In addition, there is growing awareness that while large dams drastically cut carbon emissions, they can just as drastically increase methane, another so-called greenhouse gas that heats up the planet. “If a large amount of vegetation is growing along the riverbed when a dam is built, it can decay in the lake that is created, causing the buildup and release of methane,"" says the US Environmental Protection Agency on its website.

A solution to such devastation, it was thought, is to make small run-of-the-river dams with far smaller environmental footprints. Now, a study in the journal Water Resources Research says this is a flawed assumption. The construction of small dams may reduce greenhouse-gases, but it can cause unforeseen habitat and biodiversity loss, cumulatively 100 times larger, per MW, than a big dam in some cases. “The preference of small to large dams assumes, without justification, that small hydropower dams entail fewer and less severe environmental and social externalities than large hydropower dams,"" says an abstract of the study, published online last week.

The study of 31 small dams running on the Chinese stretch of the Nu river is one of the most comprehensive of its kind. Researchers from the Oregon State University (OSU) spent five years studying the Nu river, which flows from to Myanmar and Thailand from China. The Nu river basin is considered one of the most ecologically fragile and diverse places in the world. The findings could be equally applicable to other countries, such as India. “Results reveal that biophysical impacts of small hydropower may exceed those of large hydropower, particularly with regard to habitat and hydrologic change,"" the study said.

“The result can be profound…there is damage to streams, fisheries, wildlife, threatened species and communities,"" Desiree Tullos, an OSU associate professor and water resources engineer was cited as saying in a university release. “The energy may be renewable, but this research raises serious questions about whether or not the overall process is sustainable.""

Does this mean we should focus on large dams instead? Not really, especially not in Uttarakhand, where large dams could destabilize a land that is already geologically unstable. This instability emerges from the shifting nature of the Himalayas, which continue to grow as they grind against the Asian landmass.

Obviously, stripping the slopes of forests, which bind the soil and stabilize slopes, does not help. Over the last five years, Uttarakhand has seen a particular rush of deforestation and unregulated construction on river banks and hill slopes.

The combined effect of dams and development has been to unsettle one of India’s most delicate areas. Yet, it would be premature to say the tragedy in Uttarakhand was “man-made"", as many television channels and commentators insist. Even if building codes—if indeed they exist—were followed, the slopes were not damned and the valleys not dammed, the cloudburst over Uttarakhand was so extraordinary that floods were inevitable. There was similar devastating inundation in parts of Canada and Germany. What could have been mitigated were the effects of the Uttarakhand floods. Certainly so many people need not have died and so many buildings need not have been washed away.

Uttarakhand’s development choices, most of which centre around its water resources, are limited. Big dams will generate lots of electricity but devastate forests and at a time of extreme weather and climate change, they are prone to disasters (days ago, two large dams were filled to 500% over capacity). As for small dams, India clearly needs to study them more closely than ever.

Prasad and Leela are making a documentary movie titled ""Moved by Gandhi.""

Not many people know Kusum Nair today. The simple description of “agricultural economist who wrote from a cultural perspective” perhaps describes her scholarship but is woefully inadequate to describe her as a person. She was considered brilliant in her insights and was unafraid to criticise Nobel laureates in Economics like Gunnar Myrdal and Theodore Schultz to their face. Despite that—or perhaps because of that—they and numerous other scholars were her friends.

My wife, Leela, and I were graduate students in the USA when we first met her in the university café one day. Over the next two years that Leela and I spent getting our Master’s degrees and over the years that followed, Kusum became a close friend–unknown to all of us, these were what would become the last few years of her life. She died in 1993, seventy-four years old. She called us “her children” and telephoned us even on the day she died—we were in Philadelphia and she in Kansas. Leela was perhaps the last person she called.

Kusum was sharp, acid-tongued, and even bordered on being ego-centric. But she was forthright, enormously generous and would fight with all her soul for the underprivileged. Her book titles are characteristic of her—In Defence of the Irrational Peasant (1979), or The Lonely Furrow (1969), for instance.We loved her despite all her eccentricities because she made us think—to see things in a different way, to courageously challenge orthodoxy when necessary, and she made us always look at things from the human perspective. During the Desert War of 1991, she insisted that the three of us should go and watch a re-run of “All Quiet on the Western Front”—one of the best anti-war movies ever made, I think—and she was equally firm about sitting between the two of us. Throughout the movie, we listened to her curse the folly of the war in Kuwait and Iraq. And to think that this woman had played a significant role in the 1946 “Indian Naval Mutiny” in Bombay—to use the British term for the movement. She was disgusted and angry that I was going to work with a Wall Street firm. “India needs people like to you to go back and join politics!” I did not have the guts to tell her that I did not have the guts to say no to the job offer. She was only mildly appeased when I left the Wall Street position to go back to graduate school for my Ph.D.

In any case, why would I begin a business and strategy blog post with Kusum Nair? In 1961, Kusum wrote a seminal book called Blossoms in the Dust: The Human Factor in Indian Development. It was primarily a journal that recorded her travel through the agricultural regions of India where she found that despite all the propaganda, the Indian government’s five-years plans were providing no benefits to the Indian farmer. As she recounted to us, “Sometimes the farmer did not even know we were independent of the British!” She began the book as follows:

On the stroke of midnight on 14th August, 1947, the Tricolour was hoisted to the strains of the national anthem. India became independent. The monsoon night was starless but aglow with the brilliant illuminations below. Every man, woman and child was out to witness the supreme, historic moment and the air was filled with jubilant cries of ""Jai Hind!"". An elemental force had burst its confines and swept like a flood across the land. Would it also wash away the cobwebs, the inertia and deadness of centuries? Would it create overnight a brave new country in which everything would be perfect? Anything seemed possible. Next morning, the sun rose in the eastern sky to reveal the same squalor, the staggering poverty and hunger, the deep inequalities as the day before. Myriads of flowers, yellow and orange marigolds and pink rose petals, lay scattered on the ground, stale, scentless, trampled. The municipal sweepers came and swept the streets, and the blossoms mingled in the dust.

My post is about one such blossom that we have swept into the Indian dust. “Frugal innovation” is today being termed by some as a “new paradigm”—but there is a nearly 2000-year old blossom—an Indian engineering marvel—that holds lessons for frugal innovation. Here is the story.

An innovation blossom in the dust

The Grand Anicut across the Kaveri

The flow of the Kaveri, the great river of south India, is arrested at Tiruchirapalli by a stone dam built by the Chola kings in the 2nd century AD. Locally the dam is called Kallanai (Kallu=stone; anai=dam in Tamil) but it is more popularly known by the name the colonising British gave it—“Grand Anicut” (anicut is perhaps a corruption of anai=dam and kattu=build). More technically, the anicut is not a dam, but a stone weir—a rather low structure that breaks a river into multiple streams. The Grand Anicut— a 5.4 m high wall that is 29 m long and 20 m wide—separates the Kaveri into four streams: Kollidam, Puthu Aru, Vennaru, and Kaviri.

Our story begins much later than the Cholas, however. In 1827, a 24-year old British engineer, Maj. Arthur T. Cotton, was charged with the task of inspecting the Grand Anicut. The young engineer recommended some minor but urgent repairs to the structure, but the British Government of Madras dragged its feet. It was not until 1830 that Arthur Cotton and his younger brother and assistant, Frederick Cotton, also an engineer, were commissioned to cut sluices in the Grand Anicut so that the silt sediment would flow through.

The Madras, or the Cheap School of Engineering

Lady Hope, Arthur Cotton's daughter recounts a memorable event in her biography of Arthur Cotton: Upon cutting the anicut, Frederick discovered a strange fact: to his amazement, he found that the Grand Anicut, “was hardly more than a mass of rubbish, mud, stones, and logs of wood, the safety of which depended solely on its then plastered surface.” As Bret Wallach sums up, “It was an important, perhaps even a revolutionary discovery: simple inertia had been great enough to withstand 1,600 annual floods.” What is important to us today is that for Arthur and Frederick Cotton, this discovery gave rise to what they termed, “The Madras, or the Cheap School of Engineering.”

In his next project, which was to build the Coleroon Anicut slightly downstream—Coleroon was the Anglicised name for Kolidam—Arthur Cotton applied what he had learned from the Grand Anicut: instead of a grand European style of dam, he chose a minimalist design inspired by the Grand Anicut. And we can say that he learned the lesson well for the Coleroon anicut stands even today irrigating a vast tract of about half a million acres. Some modern refurbishments had to be made over the years, and a subsequent similar dam further downstream had to be constructed when the river threatened to change course, but despite this, the Coleroon anicut is a shining example of the Madras Cheap School of Engineering.

Emboldened by his experience at replicating the design of the Grand Anicut in his work on the Coleroon anicut, Arthur Cotton used the same minimalist, resource-savvy design elsewhere. As Frederick Cotton writes, “it may be of interest to those who are following Sir Arthur in his work in Hydraulic Engineering that the most important step in his education was the lesson he learned from the builder of the so called grand anicut…it gave him, even with the slender means extended to engineers of that period, the power to control and master the greatest river of the country.”

And the greatest river Frederick Cotton is referring to here is the Godavari in Andhra Pradesh. The British estimated that the maximum discharge of the Godavari was more than 200 times the water of the Thames and 3 times that of the Nile. Arthur Cotton took the lessons from the Kaveri and applied them in the four anicuts he built across the Godavari. Indeed, Arthur Cotton is worshipped even today by the people in Andhra Pradesh for transforming through his irrigation engineering the once-famine struck delta regions of the Godavari into the rice-bowl of India that it is today. Frederick Cotton writes about his brother:

The fact was learned from an engineer of old times, but the courage with which Sir Arthur put the idea into practice in his great works was all his own….The four anicuts he built across the Godavari are not solid masses of masonry, but surface coatings of stone over the sand of the river bed, for which he substituted cut-stone for the plaster of the early engineers, but the principles are the same. …Indeed, the cheap School of engineering, which he did much to introduce is, it appears, set aside for the extravagant system of England. And after all, what is good engineering but economy! Any engineer can do anything with money; the question is how to do great things at little cost.”

If there is one lesson that Arthur Cotton’s life and work teaches us, it is that blossoms in the dust can teach us much. The 2000-year old Kallanai across the Kaveri in Tiruchirapalli is one such blossom.

Other blossoms

There are many other innovations across the world that we have forgotten. For instance, James O’Kon, an American engineer discovered recently that in the seventh century AD, the Mayans built with hemp and stone, a 600-ft suspension bridge with two piers and three spans—this bridge was the world’s longest suspension bridge for 700 years. O’Kon believes it can hold lessons for bridge technology today.

I’d love to hear if you know about other blossoms in the dust.

But that proved the solitary instance till the Ranji Trophy completed its silver jubilee in 1959-60.

Zal Irani - who was connected with the Board of Control for Cricket in India from its inception in 1928 till his death in 1970 - was honoured by having a Trophy presented in his name. Before becoming president of the board, Irani was the honorary treasurer and one of the vice-presidents.

In appreciation of his services to Indian cricket, the BCCI instituted a trophy in his name, to be presented to the winners of a match to be played between the Ranji Trophy champions of the preceding year and a selected Rest of India XI. It started in 1959-60 and was played at the end of the season. After five years it was shifted to the beginning of next season. In 1960-61,1961-62 and 1964-65 the trophy could not be played.

The first match of the series was played between Bombay and the Rest at the Ferozshah Kotla Ground in Delhi from March 18 to 20, 1960. Though the match was drawn, Bombay were declared winners on first innings lead.

This is the first time Irani Cup is being held twice in the same season. In September last year 2011-12 Ranji winners Rajasthan took on Rest of India at Bangalore. Rest won the match by an innings and 79 runs. Within five months we are having another edition of Irani Cup, with 2012-13 Ranji champions taking on Rest of India! This is because BCCI have shuffled the order of various domestic events. Henceforth Irani Cup will be played at the end of the season and not at the beginning.

Bombay’s Polly Umrigar has the distinction of scoring the first century of the tournament -- 102 in 137 minutes with 14 fours vs Rest of India in 1959-60. Gujarat off-spinner Jasu Patel was the first to take a five-wicket haul in the tournament when he returned the figures of 5 for 98 vs Bombay in 1959-60.

Rest of India's 757-7 declared against Bengal at Bangalore in 1990-91 is the highest score by a team in the tournament, while the 83 by the Rest against Bombay at Anantapur in 1963-64 is the lowest.

Murali Vijay’s 266 for the Rest against Rajasthan at Bangalore last year is the highest individual score for a batsman. There have been six more double centuries in the tournament, coming off the bat of Gundappa Viswanath, Parthasarthi Sharma, Surinder Amarnath, Ravi Shastri, Pravin Amre and Yuvraj Singh. In all, a total of 89 hundreds have been scored in the tournament, with Gundappa Viswanath and Dilip Vengsarkar scoring the most, 4 each.

Karnataka’s Syed Kirmani (v the Rest,Pune,1974-75), Rest of India’s Yashpal Sharma (v Karnataka, Bangalore, 1978-79) and VVS Laxman (v Mumbai, Chennai, 2003-04) are the three batsmen to miss a hundred by just one run.

Viswanath - with 1001 runs in 9 matches – is the highest run-scorer in the history of Irani Cup. He is followed by Wasim Jaffer (827) and Dilip Vengsarkar (779).

Left-arm spinner Murali Kartik's 9-70 for the Rest of India against Mumbai at the Wankhede Stadium in 2000-01 are the best bowling figures, while another left-arm slow bowler, Ravi Shastri, representing Bombay, has the next best figures of 9-101 (at Indore in 1981-82). Baloo Gupte and Sairaj Bahutule are the other bowlers to have taken 8 wickets in an innings. In all, there have been 67 five-wicket innings hauls, with Padmakar Shivalkar taking the most (4).

Anil Kumble's 13-138 (for the Rest against Delhi at Delhi in 1992-93) are the best match-haul figures. Murali Kartik’s 13-143 (for the Rest against Mumbai at Mumbai in 2000-01) are the second best. Mumbai’s Sairaj Bahutule (13-168 v the Rest, Mumbai, 1997-98) is the only other bowler to have taken 13 wickets in a match. In all there have been 13 ten-wicket match hauls.

Kumble is the only bowler to have taken ten wickets in a match on two occasions. Shivalkar - with 51 wickets in 10 games - is the highest wicket-taker in tournament’s history.

Ashok Mankad holds the distinction of playing most Irani Cup matches – 13 – all for Bombay. Sunil Gavaskar played 12 for Bombay and Rest of India.

This is the 52nd scheduled edition of the Irani Cup.

CNN —

Most people might know modern India for its rising billionaire class, its Bangalore-based information technology hub and its Bollywood celebrity culture.

But beneath the outward signs of prosperity, India is still one of the most malnourished nations on the planet.

According to the 2012 Global Hunger Index from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), India – despite being one of the world’s largest producers of food – ranks as low 65 on a list of 79 countries on the index.

The Indian government this week launched an ambitious fight back against food distribution problems that – alongside countries like Bangladesh and Timor-Leste – have put it near the top of the list for underweight children under the age of five.

Even by the Indian government’s own measure, nearly half of India’s children suffer from malnutrition of some sort.

The $22 billion-a-year welfare scheme aims to sell subsidized wheat and rice to 67% of its 1.2 billion people. The scheme will massively expand an existing program that provides food to 218 million people.

Under the National Food Security Bill, 75% of rural dwellers and 50% of the urban population would get five kilograms of grain per month at the subsidized prices of 3 rupees (US5 cents) for rice and 2 rupees per kilo for wheat and 1 rupee per kilo for coarse grains to be fixed for a period of three years.

The existing Antyodaya Ann Yojana (AAY), which targets the poorest of the poor, would continue to distribute 35 kilograms of grain per month to those households.

Pregnant women and lactating mothers would get a maternity benefit payment of 6,000 rupees (US$99), while children aged six months to 14 years would get take-home rations or be provided with hot cooked food.

Subsidies would also extend to Indian states and territories that run low on grain and there would be central government assistance towards the cost of intra-state transportation and handling of grains.

Critics, however, say that targeting the subsidized grain is likely to be one of the ambitious bill’s biggest headaches. Distribution through the India’s infamously corrupt state-owned ration shops could see much of the subsidized grain siphoned off to be sold for market prices elsewhere.

Others say the sheer scale of the subsidy will strain government finances. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, part of the Ministry of Agriculture, said in a report that the cost of India’s food program is likely to balloon to 6.82 trillion rupees ($126 billion) in its first three years, meaning the government would have to budget almost double its projected food subsidy each year.

Much of this cost would be associated with scaling up infrastructure to improve the existing distribution system as well as warehousing and transportation.

India has had bumper harvests in recent years, according to the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, leading to the paradox of grain rotting in silos while large swathes of the population are still malnourished.

Indian political and economic analyst Paranjoy Guha Thakurta said he believed the positive impact of the Food Bill would likely to outweigh its problems in the long term, saying that India would be forced to address problems with its distribution system.

If by spending this money you improve the system then that has to be a good thing Paranjoy Guha Thakurta

“You are talking about a system which is bad and that’s the public distribution system. You are looking at strengthening the system and that, in itself, should not be such a bad thing,” he told CNN. “Nobody is saying there’s no corruption, and nobody is saying that there is no inefficiency, but if by spending this money you improve the system, then that has to be a good thing.”

He added that even free distribution of grain had support among some sectors of Indian society, with double-digit food inflation over the past eight years imposing a greater burden on the poor than it did on India’s growing middle classes.

“Indian society has always been an unequal society historically. The food inflation that this country has witnessed in the recent past has made an already unequal society even more unequal,” he said. “Simply put, the poor spend a larger proportion of their income on food.”

Critics have also charged that the subsidy is the centerpiece of the ruling Congress party’s bid to win a third term in elections due in May, 2014, and represents a populist policy cynically aimed at winning votes.

“Of course there are politics behind it, but everything has politics behind it,” Thakurta said. “Whether the poor will vote for Congress is a separate story – only time will tell.

The fact is that in a country like ours with 1.2 billion people, of which anywhere between 200-400 million people are incredibly poor, to have a scheme of cheap food distribution is something that I as an Indian favor.”",solution,India food security bill,India,2013-02-24,2016-02-24,India,,,,,,,,,,,The $22 billion-a-year welfare scheme aims to sell subsidized wheat and rice to 67% of its 1.2 billion people.

Using workshops, field trips and dramatic talk shows, the Centre, based out of the Army Public School campus on Kamaraj Road, is striving to put that “fun” element back into Geography learning.



So, the Cauvery wouldn’t be just a line on a map. As Cultural Geographer and GeoVidyaa’s brain, Chandra Shekhar Balachandran put it, the students would learn, feel, experience the river from its Talacauvery origin to the delta. Following the water, they would learn about the architecture of buildings old and new along its route; dig deep into agriculture, mingle with the people living on its banks, listen to stories of struggle and power.



“We would discuss the politics of water, and at Srirangapattana, explore how and why a place gets chosen to be the capital of a kingdom,” Balachandran explained.



It was about connecting geography to history, an ancient course of nature’s water with man’s existence. At a GeoVidyaa workshop, he would ask the students to pick something they are passionate about, and link that passion to geography!



“The children get excited about such things, making learning so enriching. Textbooks today are the least imaginative. Students simply memorise, and the teachers are not empowered to change that,” said Balachandran.



Weaving stories around apparently disjointed words and phrases, geography learning evolves organically in those workshops. If big ships, deep waters, wide channels and fruits from afar had to connect, he would remind students that “movement” is a major theme in geography. Inviting them to online research, he would talk about movement of materials, ideas, people, information, natural entities and more.



With interesting facts



Sprinkling stories with interesting facts, GeoVidyaa would talk about geography, transportation and the OK sign behind trucks, that once stood for “On Kerosene” when fuel was rationed. Tracking altitudes on a rail journey, the students would learn to understand the MSL (Mean Sea Level) numbers on station boards.



“I start my workshops with random things and connect them. I ask students about sipping water, how fresh the water is, and then venture into historical freshness, when did it all begin. That journey takes the learners to the earth’s core, 3.5 billion years ago, to the volcano eruptions and more.”



Since its launch in October 2010, the GeoVidyaa Centre has arranged workshops galore for hundreds of teachers and students in many city schools. The Centre is part of the Indian Institute of Geographical Studies (www.tiigs.org), which organises workshops for teachers and students, intervenes at different systemic levels, and works with school managements to introduce small changes in long-term geography education.

535,1613,bangalore,2013,https://gulfnews.com/uae/weather/heaviest-rain-since-mid-2000s-in-uae-1.1258077,21 Nov 2013,Heaviest rain since mid-2000s in UAE,"Al Ain: Forecasters expect the country to experience the heaviest rain since mid-2000s, saying the unstable weather that led to hailstorm and torrential rain across the country could continue until Saturday afternoon.

Heavy rain, winds, thunder, and hailstorm played havoc across the country on Thursday, throwing the normal pace of life into a disarray and inundating low-lying roads and areas.

What’s causing this weather pattern?

The national weather bureau said the system was a result of an atmospheric low pressure that has affected the entire Arabian Gulf region.

Mohammad Al Abri, a senior official of the NCMS, said a cold trough had been passing over the emirates, leading to cloud formation, lightning and rain. The system has been moving towards north-east which will lead to moderate to heavy rain along its path. Rain and thunderstorms are likely to hit the country intermittently until Saturday.

The weather system has moved in from the upper Arabian Gulf after unleashing torrential rain in Kuwait, Bahrain, eastern Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. The NCMS had been warning of it for the last several days.

However, the weather pattern is not unusual, said Ibri, as the Arabian region has experienced such conditions in the past. The UAE too has experienced thunderstorms and torrential rain in 2006.

For today, forecasters have predicted more rain and have asked people to stay indoors. The western region of Abu Dhabi Emirate and cities on the western coastline have borne the brunt of the heaviest downpour in years.

Downpour time

Since the weather system moved in, police in different emirates have been continuously issuing alerts asking motorists to exercise caution while driving due to reduced visibility, winds, and slippery conditions on the road.

Yesterday, rain started at around 12:30am along with strong winds, lightning and thunder in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi. The unstable weather later moved on to other emirates. Residents in Al Hamra, a town in the western region, reported heavy hailstorm with snowballs as big as three to four inches.

Flash floods also damaged roads and highways in Sila and other mountainous areas. Emergency and rescue teams went into action to help people stuck in difficult situations. A second spell of rain hit different cities later on Thursday afternoon.

Authorities in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Al Ain closed down schools for the day, many important events and activities were called off yesterday such as the Dubai Air Show, and work stopped at most construction sites. On many roads across the country, traffic clogged on different highways due to pooled rainwater and accidents.

Thunderstorm and strong winds uprooted many trees, electric poles in Ruwais, Al Ain and some other cities. Conditions are not much different in Mirfa and the neighbouring areas. The thunderstorm later moved on to Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Ras Al Khaimah leading to moderate to heavy rains. Fujairah also received its share a little later and rainwater started flowing down the mountain peaks all along the eastern emirates.

Heavy downpour also flooded the drainage system in Al Ain and rainwater entered residential areas and a shopping mall in Al Jimi district. Trees were uprooted and emergency services were struggling to keep the situation under control.

The morning traffic flow faced the major impact of the troubled weather in all major cities on the western coastline.

On a brilliant March day aboard the towboat John R Ingram, Rick Calhoun, head of Cargill’s American barge business, was avidly pointing out the sights as we eased down the Mississippi River toward New Orleans at 11mph. There was a lot to see. As a bald eagle ﬂoated overhead, the crane operator of a giant Mumbai-bound ship gobbled coal from a Cargill barge. In front of our boat was a vast array of barges, a row of five lashed together with another five, then another five—25 in all, stretching out 1,000 feet, ﬁlled with 45,000 tonnes of coal and grain.



Industry surrounds us. Dow Chemical, Nucor Steel, Exxon Mobil, Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and many more industrial giants operate massive complexes on the Mississippi. Taken together, the 150-mile stretch of the river from the Gulf of Mexico up to Baton Rouge is the busiest port in the Western Hemisphere, moving some 400 million tonnes of cargo a year. Cargill alone moves more than 90 commodities on the river and operates 1,300 barges. Ingram Barge Co, which owns the towboat I rode, has roughly quadruple that number. In all, 16 percent of America’s coal, 20 percent of petroleum products and nearly all the fertiliser consumed here are shipped on the Mississippi. The action here is so thick that the crew of the Ingram calls this “suicide alley”.



There’s actually a better name for it: Corporate welfare. Once the thriving centrepiece of 19th- and early-20th-century logistics, and despite the massive proﬁts rung up by companies like Cargill and Ingram, the river barge business has become a ward of government largesse. Washington picks up more of the cost of riverborne shipping than any other type of logistics enterprise in the US except, perhaps, resupplying the International Space Station. And yet, despite the efforts of both the Bush and Obama administrations and the growing brawl over shrinking federal dollars, the Mississippi’s river of subsidies stands little chance of shrinking.



In fact, those who proﬁt from this subsidy are working mightily to increase it, using the oldest maxim in government intrusion: Never let a crisis go to waste. The crisis, in this instance, is the historic drought conditions in the Midwest that have squeezed water levels on the Mississippi. With navigation theoretically threatened, the river barge industry is now clamouring for billions of additional dollars for new reconstruction projects with the backing of some powerful heartland politicians. Their threat: Inaction will lead to strangulation of America’s great water highway, with dire economic consequences. “There’s no contingency plan for the river shutting down,” says Calhoun. “We don’t just have railcars and trucks sitting around.”



That may or may not be true. But one thing is certain: Trains and trucks largely pay their own way. Barges don’t. The US Army Corps of Engineers spends roughly $800 million a year building, operating and maintaining locks, dams and channels on the river system. Of this, the barge operators pay a minuscule share, a diesel tax of 20 cents per gallon that goes into something called the Inland Waterways Trust Fund. Last year, the shippers’ part amounted to just $80 million, barely 10 percent of the annual spend on construction and maintenance. The barge operators don’t pay any kind of toll or fee to move their cargos through the 200-plus locks on the river system. The trust fund is nearly broke.



Compare that with railroads, which got a lot of land gifts a century ago but now cover all the costs of construction and maintenance along their rights of way—amounting to $20 billion in 2011. Federal highway outlays were $40 billion last year, though $30 billion of that came from fuel taxes and other fees. Both rail and road move far more cargo than rivers do.



Still, in recent months, Calhoun and his colleagues have bellied up to the federal trough, taking advantage of the 2012 drought, to bend politicians’ ears and press their case for even bigger handouts. “Cargill is agnostic about transportation,” Calhoun says of his employer. “We use rail, and we load thousands of trucks a day, but the waterways are extremely important to our customers. Farmers need the waterways to get their product to customers.”

It’s an argument that plays emotionally to a country with literary roots from the Hudson River’s Washington Irving to the Mississippi’s Mark Twain. But economically, “if railroads can afford to maintain their networks”, says Robert Criss, a professor at Washington University in St Louis who has studied the river for decades, “barge operators should, too”.While Washington’s management of the Mississippi dates back to the 1820s, subsidisation of the river barge business really began in the 1940s. That’s when the federal government, swept up in the construction frenzy of WWII, dumped more than $50 billion (in today’s dollars) to make the Missouri River navigable by deepening it from Sioux City, Iowa, to St Louis. It seemed like the classic government infrastructure project that would quickly pay for itself, as the shipping and agriculture lobbies estimated the resulting annual river traffic would total 12 million tonnes a year.With the rise of the Interstate Highway System, the opposite happened. By the late 1980s, the Missouri ﬂoated just 2 million tonnes annually. In the 2000s, that number had fallen to just 200,000 tonnes. Still, by 1985, they were able to convince Washington to spend another $1.8 billion to dig a related 234-mile ditch connecting the Tombigbee and Tennessee rivers in Mississippi and Alabama. Similarly, cargo traffic on the new canal turned out to be only a fraction of what had been forecast to justify the outlay.Meanwhile, costs go up. The biggest current cash drain on the river system is the Ohio River’s Olmsted Locks & Dam project. It was authorised by Congress in 1988 at an estimated cost of $775 million to replace old locks built in the 1920s. A quarter of a century later, it’s still not done—and costs have ballooned to $3 billion.Looking to stop the haemorrhaging of taxpayer dollars into the rivers, the Bush administration proposed that companies pay fees of roughly $50 per barge, per trip to use locks. The push went nowhere. Then, in 2009, the Obama administration proposed creating enough new annual fees for shippers operating on the rivers to raise $900 million between 2014 and 2021—not enough to cover the actual costs of maintaining the river but more than the pittance shippers pay today.Nature intervened in the ﬁght. In late 2012, drought wrung water levels on the Mississippi River to their lowest point in decades—about 9 feet around St Louis. To squeeze through a narrow channel there without scraping bottom, operators could load their barges only halfway. A jam of headlines screamed of a possible river closing and irreparable damage to the US economy.Executives from the likes of Cargill, Ingram, oil-shipper Kirby Corp and the rest of the navigation industry pounced. They were “running around with their hair on ﬁre”, says one person close to the scene.They rallied governors, Senators, Congressmen. Their industry groups, like the American Waterways Opera- tors, put out a report warning that a shutdown of the river in December and January would strand more than $7 billion worth of cargo and ‘impact’ 20,000 jobs and $130 million in wages. There was talk about a repeat of the summer of 1988 when river levels got so low that hundreds of barges got stuck.With water levels looking dire, Calhoun took advantage of the emergency to conﬂate short-term concerns with long-term desires. In testimony to a Senate committee last September, he insisted that America’s ageing system of seaports and water-ways were in desperate need of $30 billion in investment by 2020 in order to maintain navigation and that it was up to the federal government to foot the bill. “It’s critical that we continue to invest,” says Calhoun, pointing out that more than half the locks on the river are more than 50 years old.Dozens of Senators, Congressmen and state governors urged the Obama administration to declare an emergency on the Mississippi and overrule the US Army Corps of Engineers, which had rejected requests to release enough water from behind dams on the Missouri River to raise the Mississippi.

(This story appears in the 03 May, 2013 issue of Forbes India. To visit our Archives, click here.)

But somewhat surprisingly, given that Obama’s home state of Illinois is tied inextricably to the river, no such declaration was made nor did the Missouri water come. Traffic was slowed and operators were forced to push ‘tows’ of just 15 barges instead of 25 or 40. And although the Corps of Engineers agrees that the drought was as bad or worse than any in 50 years, they made sure that even around St Louis they maintained a navigation channel at least 9 feet deep and 300 feet wide, and spent $10 million (all taxpayer dollars) blasting a series of rock pinnacles around Thebes, Illinois that had been a longtime source of navigation headaches.A spokeswoman for the Corps says they never doubted their ability to fulﬁl their mission of keeping the river navigable.Facts, of course, matter little in the midst of a cash-fuelled hysteria. The drought threat has reenergised efforts to grab billions in new funding for Mississippi infrastructure. In recent weeks, a group of Senators has introduced the RIVER Act (Reinvesting In Vital Economic Rivers). And a bunch of Congressmen, led by Kentucky Republican Ed Whitﬁeld, has introduced another acronym-happy bill known as the Waterways are Vital for the Economy, Energy, Efficiency & Environment Act (WAVE4). Both bills would appropriate some $8 billion for new river infrastructure and increase federal payments into the waterways trust fund. “The real reason to do this bill,” says Whitﬁeld, “is because the Inland Waterways Trust Fund, like nearly every other federal trust fund, is broke”. In return for these billions, the barge industry has agreed to pay as much as an extra 9 cents a gallon tax on their diesel—amounting to a piddling $40 million a year.Why can’t industry pick up more of the tab? Craig Philip, the CEO of Ingram, says that would be unfair. “Consider all the other beneﬁciaries of the river,” he urges me. “People use it for drinking water, hydropower, ﬂood control, wildlife conservation, recreation and irrigation. And yet, none of these other beneﬁciaries pays anything. To add insult to injury, last December, the Corps declared that there was enough water on the Missouri River to permit oil and gas drilling to extract it for ‘fracking’. ” Which sounds well and good, except that spending billions on barge lanes does nothing to help ﬁsheries (they’re often ruined by it) or ﬂooding (there are more ﬂoods than ever) or, especially, recreation. “A sailboat doesn’t need a 9-foot channel,” says Criss. “And besides, how fun is it to sail a boat while having a big barge come crashing by?”In terms of barge lanes as a national interest, times have changed. Rivers remain important for moving cargo, but the nation could now get by without them. According to the US Department of Energy, America’s waterways are used for shipping some 160 billion tonne-miles per year (1 tonne-mile is the movement of 1 tonne of cargo over a distance of 1 mile), most of that on the Mississippi system. Compare that with railroads, which do 1.3 trillion tonne-miles, and trucks, also at 1.3 trillion tonne-miles—all at very little cost to taxpayers. Splitting all that water-borne cargo between them would require roughly 10 percent more trains and trucks. It could be done, and arguably should be, in a post-sequestration era.But don’t expect that to happen anytime soon. “We love it out here,” Josh Tingle, one of the crewmen on the Ingram boat told me as we stood amid the coal barges on the front of the tow. “Once you wear out your ﬁrst pair of boots, you’re done—the water gets in your blood. As long as god’s willing, I’ll be out here.” And so, it seems, will taxpayers.",issue,Mississippi River Flood,Mississippi River,2012-12-01,2013-01-31,['Mississippi River'],"['10 inches', '12 inches', '14 inches']","['10 billion dollars', '12 billion dollars', '14 billion dollars']","['100', '120', '140']","['20,000 jobs', '130 million dollars in wages', '30 billion dollars in investment by 2020']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

On a recent Saturday morning at 9 am, Wipro Chairman Azim Premji walked into the JN Tata Auditorium at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore to hand out the Earthian awards to students from around the country. For over a decade Wipro has been advocating quality education in schools. Four years ago it added ecology to its social agenda. The Earthian awards, given to students for writing a paper on sustainability, is one way in which Wipro has been trying to build awareness about tackling environmental issues among the youth of this country.

The symbolism of the venue (IISc was set up with grants given by the Tatas) was hard to overlook. Premji has been a big admirer of the Tatas model of philanthropy. For over a decade now he has tried to push Wipro on a similar path by using the enormous resources of the company to solve a crucial social issue such as education.After the awards Premji took some questions from the audience. A young schoolgirl, around 15 years of age, asked Premji to pick the most defining moments of his life. Premji chose two. The first moment, he said, was at the age of 21, when he realised how dependant he was on people around him (Premji had to take over his family business upon his father’s sudden death). And second, almost three decades later, in the year 1999-2000, when he had the epiphany that he must contribute to a social issue.“The new world order needs three Es—economic growth, equitable society, and ecological sustainability,” wrote Premji in Wipro’s recent sustainability report. “We also believe that business must play a crucial role in making this happen. Government and civil society are equal stakeholders in this mission, but as a crucible of innovation, problem solving and value creation, the business sector is uniquely positioned to make a vital difference.”The relationship between business and society has never been an easy one. In a country like India, where socialism has had a long history, it has been even more thorny. The mantle of being the protector, the provider belongs to the government, at least in the mind of the society. Business exists to make money. It is opportunistic. It is out to exploit. Can this thinking change? Can business and society find a way to talk to each other?The government certainly thinks so. The new Companies Bill has introduced a small measure that has the potential to change the way business and society engage with each other. The Bill recommends that companies earning a turnover of more than Rs 1,000 crore spend up to 2 percent of their average net profits (of past three years) on corporate social responsibility (CSR). The Bill makes reporting of spends on CSR mandatory in company balance sheets. In case the company is unable to spend 2 percent, it needs to explain why it has not been able to do so in a public document.The Bill has not yet become a law. It is yet to be passed by the Rajya Sabha, upon which it will go to the President for clearance. The exact provisions of the Bill are still being debated with the various industry bodies. But the government has signalled its intent. By our calculations, over the next few years, as much Rs 5,611 crore could flow to social causes ranging from poverty alleviation to tech incubators, from the top 100 Indian listed companies alone. The number will obviously be much higher if we consider the larger universe of multinational companies operating in India, mid-cap companies and SMEs.The government directive isn’t a knee-jerk reaction. Research done by CSRidentity.com shows that the top 100 companies in India are already spending upwards of Rs 1,750 crore every year on CSR. This sum would be approximately 1 percent of their net profits.All that is now happening is that the random acts of kindness will become more focussed and hence impactful. Reliance Industries (RIL), State Bank of India (SBI), Tata Steel, National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Coal India (CIL) and Steel Authority of India (SAIL) are all spending more than Rs 100 crore each year on CSR. All these companies and some more are now experimenting and trying to make CSR an integral part of their business.Now this entire move to get corporations to spend 2 percent of profits has critics. One of the detractors is Azim Premji himself who doesn’t think it is a good idea to force companies to spend money. This is a fair observation but the government isn’t really being coercive. There are no punitive measures as long as an independent director in the firm can explain the lack of spending. In some time most companies will be able to develop a CSR strategy simply because every year they will be publicly stating what they did or did not do.

This is where the second objection comes in. Why should businesses be even forced to think about CSR? Businesses are basically set up to serve the shareholder. The shareholder can focus on social good on his personal money, but business, well, they aren’t real people with feelings so they should be left alone. “This is the shareholder money, how can the government decide how it should be spent. It is just plain wrong,” says Mohandas Pai, chairman, Manipal Education Global and the man instrumental in setting up Akshaya Patra, one of Asia’s largest mid-day meal programmes. In a scathing critique, Manish Sabharwal, chairman, Teamlease Services, wrote in The Economic Times on February 11, “Just like the checklist view of corporate governance did not lead to better companies, the checklist view of CSR will not create better corporate citizens.”Both Pai and Sabharwal are right, but their views are anchored in the old paradigm of capitalism. That paradigm was over the day Lehman crashed. Nobody wants companies that give primacy to the shareholder when the going is good, but rush for taxpayer bailouts when the tide turns. The world wants its companies as real things talking to them, rather than be soul-less legal entities.In the Anglo-Saxon world, which gave us capitalism, the thinking about how business connects to society has changed. Call it what you will—CSR, Conscious Capitalism, Double bottom-line, or Shared Value—smart CEOs know that Milton Friedman’s credo (the social responsibility of a business is to increase its profits) is pretty much dead today.Nobody illustrates the new thinking better than Paul Polman, CEO, Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company. In our special Forbes India Anniversary Edition in May last year, Polman wrote, “Since the 1980s we have all been worshipping at the altar of shareholder value. This is a doctrine which says that the principal purpose of business is to maximise returns to its investors. Although important, it cannot be the only purpose.”In a separate article published in the Harvard Business Review, Polman estimates that in 2011 alone, climate change (droughts, floods, tsunami and earthquakes) and political crises because of non-sustainable growth cost Unilever over 200 million euros. He talked about studies, which said that the total profits of the consumer goods industry could be wiped out in about 30 years, if no action is taken.In November 2010, Polman announced that Unilever was making social change a core part of its business model. He laid out an audacious new mission—the Sustainable Living Plan—under which by 2020 Unilever would double its revenue, while cutting its environmental impact in half. Managers in Unilever, from the CEO downward, have sustainability goals as part of their compensation.Polman was honest enough to admit that he doesn’t have all the answers on how to tackle this issue, but by addressing it in such a public way and announcing a strategy he has at least managed to put a human face on it. “When people talk about a new code of ethics for business this is what we mean. For us it is a new form of business: One that focuses on the long term; one that sees business as part of society, not separate from it; one where companies seek to address the big social and environmental issues that confront humanity; one where the needs of citizens and communities carry the same weight as the demands of shareholders,” wrote Polman in his signed column in Forbes India.Many Indian companies understand this. “Business is not conducted in a vacuum. We have to think of ourselves as responsible members of the society,” says Shikha Sharma, CEO, Axis Bank. Once this is clear the only thing left is to figure out the approach.Don’t let anyone tell you that there is one Holy Grail approach to doing good. There isn’t. A company could either choose to back a few causes or it could back many. As long as the preparation is appropriate, both are possible.At ICICI Bank, the board and the entire top team, led by CEO & MD Chanda Kochhar has been involved in a 10-year review of its CSR strategy for the past few months. A new ‘business plan’—just like the one the team would do for its regular business, incorporating the lessons that they’ve learnt—will now be presented to the board on March 31.What the review revealed though is instructive. It found that their earlier strategy of going through intermediaries—either partnering NGOs or the government—wasn’t delivering clear benefits. “Most NGOs were unwilling to be accountable for the monies we gave them,” says K Ramkumar, executive director and head of operations and human resources at ICICI Bank.What’s more, the impact was too scattered for them to find visible impact of spends. The story was no different when the ICICI Foundation chose to partner the government to build capabilities to raise the level of teaching in a local school before moving on to other projects. Yet once they stepped in to improve the curriculum and the quality of teaching, it almost seemed like “a case of abdication” by the state government. They would simply walk away, leaving it in the hands of the foundation for perpetuity. Besides, every time the government changed, or a supportive official was transferred, the new lot was simply not interested in picking up the threads. That has prompted ICICI Bank to reboot its CSR strategy. The crux of its new strategy will be to directly deliver benefits, instead of relying on an intermediary.While the details are still being firmed up, to keep things simple, the bank has decided to pick two main areas where it believes it already has the internal competencies: Skill development and financial inclusion, says Kochhar.

Many other companies are following a similar approach, that is, look for a distinct fit with their core business. For instance, Tata Motors started a safe driving programme. ITC went in and realigned its supply chain to help farmers. HUL works with children in schools and mothers through health clinics to educate them about hygiene behaviour. Their aim is to change the hygiene behaviour of 1 billion consumers in Asia, Africa and Latin America by educating them about the benefits of hand washing at key times. Wipro has chosen education as its area of focus.But even with this approach it is necessary to concentrate efforts. In 2011-12, a large public sector bank embarked on a big programme to distribute 13,600 water filters to as many schools. There is very little impact one such water filter will have in a school with hundreds of kids. It is as good as nothing. “Most corporate activity is very dilute and dispersed. It would make much more sense if it were targeted at a smaller geographic area,” says Sanjay Bapat, founder, CSRidentity.com.Hunkering down to support a big cause over the years may make practical sense, but not everyone seems to believe in sticking to the knitting. Some firms like Axis Bank have chosen to work across the CSR spectrum. C Babu Joseph, executive trustee and CEO, Axis Foundation, says that the bank believes that in India a variety of causes need to be funded. “If we stick to a few we will not be able to help others who may need it.” So they have funded education, livelihood, water conservation (as a means to ensure food security), and even an organisation that helps highway accident victims. “If we had a limited focus, we would have a limited impact and we would not be able to help more number of NGOs,” he says.Axis Foundation is quite clear in that it lays out a roadmap of CSR activity over a three to five year time frame. So in the past, it was education, but over the next three years or so, the Axis Foundation is concentrating on livelihood. “Today our big audacious goal is to generate 1 million sustainable livelihoods because right now livelihood enhancement is our focus area in CSR,” says Joseph. Over 80 percent of the foundation’s efforts are focussed on livelihoods now, the remaining goes to education and health.Before it engages with an NGO, the Axis Foundation tells them that the foundation will invest in that cause for a period of three to five years, and at an appropriate time the NGO must look for new donors. “We help them in that process, but we make it clear that we will move away one day,” says Joseph.Wipro does something similar for its flagship programme WATIS (Wipro Applying Thought in Schools). Over the last decade Wipro has touched 2,000 schools and 8 lakh students through WATIS.WATIS works like a venture capital setup. A team of two full-time professionals runs this programme and works with a network of partners. Wipro provides funding, mentoring, and its brand power to help open up doors for the organisations. Funding is always tied to specific projects or longer-term programmes. It does not invest directly into the organisation. Today, it works with 30 partners—both for-profit and not-for-profit. It typically works with a partner organisation for three-five years till it finds that the organisation has reached scale and maturity.There are no quick fixes when it comes to solving social issues. “To make a real difference in society, you often need to invest for a generation. A problem like malnutrition or adolescent marriage needs sustained attention for a minimum of five years,” says Dola Mohapatra, national director, ChildFund India, an international NGO working in India for 60 years. It has to be said though that Axis Bank and Wipro are doing something new and this needs to be understood better. The average tenure of CEOs and senior management is much lower today. There is no guarantee that once people change, the same cause will continue to receive attention. So it is better that even the NGOs get to know other corporations who will fund their cause. Till date, the Axis Foundation has worked with 63 NGOs. It is currently working with 23. “We believe that many NGOs have become better and more efficient organisations because of our association,” says Joseph.It is in making NGOs more organised that corporations can really help. Most NGOs are run poorly. They often don’t measure what has worked. They can’t hire top talent and remain a rag-tag army out to change the world. Companies can help change that because they know how measuring, reporting and reviewing results can dramatically improve the quality of any effort.Till now CSR has been an appendage simply because most corporations spend the money and don’t bother to find out the results of their intervention. They had little to tell their NGO partners who themselves did not have the ability to become bigger.Shortly after she took over, Vidya Shah, who heads the Edelweiss Foundation, found that Edelweiss had committed 1 percent of its pre-tax profits to philanthropy, right from the start. Yet the giving to charity was done in an unstructured way; largely based on the relationship with the head of the NGO. “We realised that we could add a lot of value as Edelweiss because we had the experience of working with young entrepreneurs,” says Shah. She now picks up expertise on areas such as strategy, HR, financial sustainability and systems and MIS (management information system) from the firm’s business vertical for their CSR strategy.

(This story appears in the 22 March, 2013 issue of Forbes India. To visit our Archives, click here.)

For instance, the firm has helped build an MIS platform for an NGO that managed remand homes across seven states. This helps the NGO capture data on the condition of every home while presenting the findings to the state, rather than rely on anecdotal evidence. It took two executives from Edelweiss’ in-house business solutions a year to build this low-cost platform.Now companies realise that unless they work with the NGOs to improve monitoring and reporting, they will not be able to report success or failure and get wider support from their boards. “Every large corporate should have a CSR committee. Work has to be progressively done and monitored at the board level,” says MG Ramachandran, former chairman of Indian Oil, and now independent director on the board of ICICI Bank, where he heads the CSR committee.That’s beginning to change. One of the most important ways in which Wipro helps its partners is by creating an ecosystem and connecting partners to each other. For example, every year it organises a partner forum where all organisations in its network come together for a two-day offsite where they learn and network with each other. Many times Premji too attends these sessions. “We know that no amount of money we spend is enough for tackling a domain as large as education, but more than money we leverage our brand in making these partnerships work,” says Anurag Behar, chief sustainability officer, Wipro.Premji is very clear that CSR should be seen as priority inside Wipro. So it is always one of his direct reports who has the responsibility for managing this function. He makes time for every important CSR event, and any opportunity that he gets to talk to an external audience—be it through his speeches at external events or newspaper write-ups—he chooses to talk on the quality of education in India. Every quarter he does a review of the CSR programme just as he does with his other business units.Axis Foundation has always been very clear about reviewing its programmes. They do a baseline survey of the existing state of affair before they begin work in a particular area. Since the ‘before’ is known, the impact can be measured very clearly. “We have a quarterly review of all our projects. We present this to our board. If we feel that at the end of a year no visible impact is being felt, in spite of our best efforts, then we curtail our engagement with that project. This is rare and we usually persist,” says Joseph.The effect of seeing a social programme yield verifiable results brings another advantage. Employees in a company want to be associated with something that is making an impact.Take for instance how employees of Cognizant relate to CSR. Studies have shown that volunteering is a great way to build loyalty among the new generation of knowledge workers. In 2011, Deloitte conducted online interviews with 1,500 ‘millennials’ (ages 21 to 35) who work at companies with 1,000 or more employees that offer employee volunteer activities or programmes. The survey shows that millennials who frequently participate in their company’s employee volunteer activities are two times more likely to rate their corporate culture “very positive” as compared to those who rarely or never volunteer (56 percent vs 28 percent).This is the kind of learning that Cognizant has put into practice through a corporate volunteering programme, Outreach. Since the programme was set up, 20,000 employees have volunteered and have spent a cumulative 2 lakh volunteering hours. Cognizant Outreach supports schools in the vicinity of the company campuses.The programme works on a bottoms-up model, employees find schools and causes they want to support and present ideas to the Outreach council. Cognizant provides financial and administration support and sets aside a small budget. Archana Raghuram who heads the programme says that “we do not take up purely funding causes, so if it is only donating money for making a classroom, we don’t do it, employees have to volunteer for it as well.”Employees take classes, provide career counselling, as well as teach computer science and English to students in these schools. In India, the programme has touched about 100 schools. The reason the programme works is because it has the attention from the highest levels. It was started at the behest of CEO Francisco D’Souza and directly reports to the president of the company, Gordon Coburn. Every quarter, the programme head submits a progress report to the CFO.Now, this is the critical piece. For CSR projects to work, it has to evolve into a top management priority. At ICICI Bank, the new focus is on making some of its senior-most executives accountable for results in CSR to the board, rather than leave it to some lowly executive in a CSR department. Having people with the clout and influence to drive the agenda across the firm is a vital part of any CSR strategy.Taken in the right spirit, CSR has the capacity of making firms humane. It can be the soul inside the profit-making machine that is the modern corporation. Thought of in those terms, 2 percent may be a small price to pay.(Additional reporting by Prince Mathews Thomas)",discussion,2013 floods in India,India,June 1,July 10,"Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Odisha, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir",94 cm,"Rs 10,000 crore","3,000",10 million people affected,"The floods were caused by heavy rainfall in the monsoon season.

Natural resources are stretched, climate change is altering the planet’s weather patterns and the rising human population will eventually become unsustainable. The time to act is now. Thankfully international governments are taking notice, but these issues are already having a profound impact on the world. Here, Friday takes a look at the problems facing the world and asks what can be done to solve them.

Rising sea levels

Over the past century the average global sea level has risen by between ten and 20 centimetres, and that rate is increasing. The cause is global warming. Burning fossil fuels and other human and natural activities release heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. The oceans absorb about 80 per cent of this additional heat. Heated water expands and fuels the melting of glaciers and polar ice caps, meaning there is more water in the oceans. When sea levels rise rapidly, even a small increase can have devastating effects on coastal ecosystems and human populations. Hundreds of millions of people live in areas that will become increasingly vulnerable to flooding. Higher sea levels have forced people to abandon their homes and relocate. Eventually, low-lying islands could be submerged completely.

Earlier this year a survey of glaciologists revealed that many feared they had seriously underestimated the potential for melting ice sheets to contribute to a catastrophic increase in sea levels in the coming decades. Some scientists estimate an increase of one metre or more by 2100.



But with uncertainty about its magnitude, it is difficult to create a solution for the problem. Increased investment in flood defences would protect coastal regions in the short term, but ultimately only a fundamental reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions would stop the ocean levels from rising, preventing the floods.

Pollution

The UAE is no stranger to pollution. Last year the eastern shores were hit by a slick of oil caused by the dumping of crude and sludge by tankers and other vessels in violation of local and international laws. The pollution killed a large number of fish.

In 2010 the UAE was named one of the world’s largest producers of waste. That year, Abu Dhabi’s average annual per capita household waste stood at 730 kilograms, while Dubai followed closely at 725 kilograms, according to a report by Al Ghurair University. The figures were almost 30 per cent more than the averages of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member states.

Pesticides, herbicides, chemical fertilisers, detergents, oil, sewage, plastics and other solids are choking the oceans. Many of these pollutants collect on the ocean floor where they are consumed by small marine organisms and are introduced into the global food chain.

Nitrogen-rich fertilisers wash into oceans and lakes and spawn massive blooms of algae that rob the water of oxygen and create dead zones for plant and animal life. In some areas ocean currents compact decomposing plastic items and other rubbish into gigantic, swirling rubbish islands. One in the North Pacific, known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, is estimated to be the size of Texas.

However, pollutants in the atmosphere are the main factor contributing to global warming. Carbon dioxide, mainly through burning fossil fuels, locks in heat. Methane is another potent greenhouse gas, and actually traps heat in the earth’s atmosphere at a higher rate than carbon dioxide. It is produced by a number of human sources including coal mining, livestock farming and landfills.

Recycling efforts, carbon-capture technology and investment in alternative energy sources will all need to be employed to reduce the catastrophic effects pollutants are having on the planet.

Food shortages

Last year was a disastrous year for global food production. Heat waves, floods and droughts led to harvest failures in many food-producing regions of the world including the USA and Ukraine. Levels of production were so badly hit that reserves are at a worryingly low level. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that today global food reserves would only last 74 days if food production was curtailed. The real worry now is that another year of adverse weather will further reduce the amount of food available.

Abdul Reza Abbassian, a senior grain analyst with the FAO, says, “We’ve not been producing as much as we are consuming. That is why stocks are being run down. Supplies are now very tight across the world and reserves are at a very low level.”

The shortages are driving up prices of staples such as wheat and rice, and Oxfam has warned that prices could double in the next 20 years, regularly sparking the kind of food riots seen in 2008 in Haiti and in parts of Africa.

Some scientists are hopeful that the answer will be provided by introducing more drought-resistant, high-yield genetically modified (GM) crops. They are also developing other novel ways to boost production. Last year Dutch scientists successfully created strips of muscle tissue in a laboratory using stem cells. The technique could become a more efficient way of ‘growing’ meat.

Water stress

The world is running out of clean drinking water. Resources are overexploited by growing populations. Pollution, climate change and demand from agriculture

create stress on our limited resources.

Last year the InterAction Council (IAC), a group of 40 prominent former government leaders, together with the United Nations University’s Institute for Water, Environment and Health released a report detailing the emerging threat of water scarcity and urged the United Nations Security Council to take immediate action.

Around 3,800 cubic kilometres of fresh water is extracted from aquatic ecosystems around the world every year. With about one billion more mouths to feed by 2025, global agriculture alone will require another 1,000 cubic kilometres (1 trillion cubic metres) of water per year – almost equal to the annual flow of 20 Niles or 100 Colorado Rivers.

The report warned that conflict over water resources could break out in Sub-Saharan Africa, West Asia and North Africa. It also predicted that demand for water in China and India will exceed supply within 20 years.

The IAC called for global reform of attitudes and policies towards water use and recommended improved conservation, efficiency and an increase in investment in sustainable water supplies and sanitation.

In the future, countries with surplus water could also begin supplying nations suffering droughts through a trade system.

The UN predicts that by 2020 there will be 50 million environmental refugees; people displaced from their homelands by environmental factors such as food shortage, drought and flooding. The tide of human misery is already on the rise. There has already been a drastic increase in migrants moving to Southern Europe from Africa, in part due to food shortages.

People are also being forced out of their homes because, according to Oxford University’s Norman Myers, they, “can no longer gain a secure livelihood in their homelands because of drought, soil erosion, desertification, deforestation and other environmental problems, together with the associated problems of population pressures and poverty”.

Environmental factors are also driving profound demographic shifts. In countries affected by climate change there has been an exodus from the rural areas to the city because people are unable to make a living from the land. In Bangladesh storms, floods and crop damage drive 400,000 people a year from the villages to the capital, Dhaka.

Sadly their relief may only be temporary, as Dhaka is located just a few metres above sea level and is at high risk of rising sea levels.

Energy shortages

Rapid economic and population growth are putting stress on energy supplies in many parts of the world. Countries including South Africa and Tajikistan are plagued by power cuts and there have been riots in several places because of disruptions to electricity supply. Rich states are no longer strangers to periodic blackouts either. In the developing world, 1.6 billion people – about a quarter of the human race – have no access to electricity.

Meanwhile, demand for electricity is rising faster than supply. The International Energy Agency (IEA) says the world’s energy needs could be 50 per cent higher in 2030 than they are today.

Fossil fuels, which we have relied on to foster growth through the industrial and modern age, will one day run out and a cleaner, more sustainable alternative needs to be found. Mohammad Al Baradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, is calling for governments to unite to find a solution.

“The need for coordinated political action on energy has never been more acute. Yet there is no global energy institution in which the countries of the world can agree on joint solutions to the potentially enormous problems we see emerging,” he says.

Species extinction

The plight of endangered species such as the giant panda and the Sumatran tiger attracts worldwide attention. But these animals are just the tip of an extinction iceberg that threatens thousands of plant and animal species.

A 2009 study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Biodiversity Conservation Group found that 17,291 species are at serious risk of extinction. This includes 21 per cent of all known mammals, 30 per cent of amphibians, 70 per cent of plants and 35 per cent of invertebrates.

Experts have signalled that the world is in the grips of its “sixth great extinction” of species, driven by the destruction of natural habitats, poaching, the spread of alien germs, disease and climate change.

Technology is being used to help preserve some of these species. Captive breeding projects can go some way towards bolstering diminishing wild populations.



Biological storage facilities such as the UK-based Frozen Ark project and the Kew Seed Repository now store vital organic material, which could be used to bring extinct species back to life in the future.

Disease

In 1918 a global flu pandemic infected about 500 million people and killed about 100 million. Another pandemic is long overdue. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “influenza and other emerging epidemic diseases present a major threat to life, economies and security in an increasingly globalised world”.

A new wave of infection will spread faster than previous pandemics because the world is becoming increasingly overpopulated and more interconnected. Pandemics associated with emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are now occurring in historically unprecedented numbers.

Since 2001, WHO has identified more than 1,100 epidemics of international importance. More than 70 per cent of new and emerging diseases originate in animals. The Sars outbreak of 2003 vividly demonstrates how much the world has changed in terms of its vulnerability to economic and social disruptions when outbreaks occur.



When it happens, the first influenza epidemic of the 21st century could have potentially catastrophic consequences for human life, health and the world economy.

The timing and severity cannot be predicted, but thanks to international cooperation, there is hope it can be managed through quicker detection and mapping. Research and development of vaccines and rapid tools for diagnosis will serve to protect people more effectively than ever before.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
540,1618,bangalore,2013,https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/philippines/makati-city-implements-plastic-bag-ban-1.1199719,20 Jun 2013,Makati City implements plastic bag ban,"Manila: Some 49 monitoring teams found erring establishments that did not comply on the first day of the ban of the use of all non-biodegradable packaging materials in Makati City, the financial district, sources said, adding that Makati is participating in a national campaign against the use of plastic which has been blamed for excessive flash floods during the rainy season.

“Many erring establishments received tickets on the first day of compliance test,” said Danny Villas, Makati City’s environment officer.

Members of the monitoring team, composed of four per team, plied Makati City’s high and low-end canteens, convenience stores, department stores, eateries, fast food chains, public markets, shopping malls, and supermarkets to check on their compliance to the city’s Plastic Regulation Order which bans the use of plastic and polystyrene as packaging materials, said Villas, adding the order also bans the use, sale and distribution of non-biodegradable products.

Resistance came from sidewalk vendors including customers in supermarkets who were not prepared for the local ordinance’s implementation, said Villas.

“We made sure that our monitoring teams are fully prepared to recognise violations of the ban during their inspection (of establishments) and to take appropriate action in accordance with the provisions of the executive order and Makati City’s Solid Waste Management Code,” said Makati City Mayor Jejomar Erwin Binay, adding that members of the monitoring team who belong to Makati City’s department of environmental services were all briefed on Tuesday on guidelines in the distribution and issuance of apprehension tickets to erring establishments,

According to the ordinance, individual violators are fined P1,000 (Dh83.33) or imprisoned for five to 30 days, or both; establishments are fined P5,000 (Dh 416.66), the company owner imprisoned from 30 days to a year, and the company’s business permit cancelled.

The local code also calls on establishments to provide for free or for a fee, paper bags, cloth bags, and baskets made of biodegradable materials in lieu of plastic bags.

Establishments and village halls are also required to place a marked “plastic bag recovery bin” at their premises’ entrances and exits. They will serve as drop-off points for the collection of plastic bags from residents.

Last December, Mayor Binay issued an executive order that extended to June 20 the deadline of a city code that gave establishments since 2003 a nine-year grace period to comply with the use of environment-friendly packaging materials. The extension was to give establishments time to consume their inventories of plastics and other non-biodegradable materials, said Binay.

Makati City has a population of half a million, which soars to 3.7 million with the number of workers in banks, companies, embassies, shopping malls, and restaurants based in the financial district.

Makati is the ninth of Metro Manila’s 17 districts that has issued the plastic ban, raising to seven million the number of people affected by it. Metro Manila has a population of 13 million.

Authorities have blamed plastic products for flashfloods in Metro Manila, during the rainy season which begins in June. Some 20 typhoons hit the Philippines annually.
