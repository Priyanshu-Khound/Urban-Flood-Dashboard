HYDERABAD: To prevent loss of lives and allow early evacuation during intense rains, the GHMC’s Enforcement Vigilance & Disaster Management (EVDM) wing is coming up with an urban flood early warning system in the city.A joint initiative of EVDM and IIT-Hyderabad, this flood warning system will help identify all vulnerable and flood-prone areas based on the rainfall data in the last two decades.As of now, 200 flood-prone areas have been identified in ‘major’, ‘medium’ and ‘minor’ categories. As many as 12,525 properties face a risk of floods.Apart from sourcing information from radar, satellite data and automatic weather stations for rainfall intensity and wind speed, the flood warning system will utilise hydrological sensors (rain gauge, flow rate and depth) to be installed in nalas for monitoring the flow of water during monsoons and CCTVs at vulnerable areas to assess the situation.Under this project, all vulnerable areas will be colour coded showing risk level, possibility of inundation, and number of houses or people to be affected. If there is flood alert, this system will map nearby resources like government buildings, rescue teams, hospitals, police stations and manpower required for all relief measures.This entire system will be functional through an emergency operation centre to be set up in police Integrated Command and Control Centre. EVDM has sent the proposal to National Disaster Management Authority and got in principle consent. The project requires 57 crore from NDMA.Speaking to TOI, EVDM director N Prakash Reddy said, “Once we get funds from NDMA, we will invite tenders for the project. It will take one year to implement it on the ground. The system is the need of the hour to improve the city’s resilience to floods and ensure the safety of residents. We also do live monitoring of rescue teams during the floods.” He said once there is a flood forecast, the emergency operating centre will disseminate a common alerting protocol, a standard message along with department-wise SOP will be sent to concerned rescue team, officers, other resource managers to take action.According to IIT-H, this initiative will be a collaborative effort with GHMC, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Telangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS) and National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC).“This project has been on my mind since five years. We proposed it to GHMC, which immediately okayed it. There was a need to develop an early flood warning system which can make cities flood resilient via integrating meteorological, hydrological and other stakeholders,” said R Satish, lead researcher and associate professor, department of civil engineering & climate change, IIT-Hyderabad.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Heavy rain in Hyderabad, on July 20, has left several areas stranded in flood water in localities such as Nagole, Rajendranagar and Qutbullahpur.

The damage is more in colonies closer to water bodies, due to either lakes overflowing or insufficiency of the surplus canals. GHMC Commissioner Ronald Rose, together with senior officials inspected the IDL Lake which has flooded low lying areas in Moosapet.

Officials explained that sluice gates were opened as a precautionary measure, yet two days of continuous rain has increased the water levels in the lake, and due to encroachments on the surplus canal, the flood water escaped and inundated the colonies.

Mr. Rose then inspected the Suraram Lake in the Gajularamaram area, surplus flows from which flooded colonies such as Balaji Enclave and Vokshith Enclave.

Madina Colony in Rajendra Nagar, and Mamata Colony in Nagole area some other areas flooded under the impact of heavy rains on Thursday. Several colonies outside GHMC under the limits of Nizampet Municipal Corporation too were flooded due to incessant rain.

Government Unani Hospital in Charminar area reportedly started leaking from the roof due to which patients had to be either discharged or shifted to safer locations.

Up to 8.30 a.m. on Friday, the highest of almost 12 centimetres of rainfall was recorded at Miyapur and Hafeezpet, followed by East Anandbagh at Malkajgiri at 11.5 centimetres. A large part of the city received around 6 to 10 centimetres of rain, as recorded by the automatic weather stations installed across various locations.

Officials are keeping close watch on the levels of Hussain Sagar lake and the twin reservoirs at Gandipet and monitoring the influx quantities. A total 5800 cusecs of flood water is being discharged from the Hussain Sagar Lake as recorded at about 11 a.m.

While the inflows have been around 1100-1200 cusecs into the Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar reservoirs, full tank level is yet to be reached for any outflows, a statement from the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board informed.",flood,Hyderabad Floods 2023,"Hyderabad, Telangana, India",2023-07-20,2023-07-21,"['Nagole', 'Rajendranagar', 'Qutbullahpur']","['12 cm, 11.5 cm']","['Government Unani Hospital in Charminar area reportedly started leaking from the roof due to which patients had to be either discharged or shifted to safer locations', 'Several colonies outside GHMC under the limits of Nizampet Municipal Corporation too were flooded due to incessant rain']",0,"['A large part of the city received around 6 to 10 centimetres of rain', 'A total 5800 cusecs of flood water is being discharged from the Hussain Sagar Lake as recorded at about 11 a.m.', 'While the inflows have been around 1100-1200 cusecs into the Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar reservoirs, full tank level is yet to be reached for any outflows']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

He said the IMD had identified five red zones in the entire state for extremely heavy rainfall, five of them in Nizamabad district alone – Perkit, Vailpur, Bhimgal, Konasamandar and Jakranpalli.

While Perkit received 332.3 mm rainfall overnight, Bheemgal recorded a rainfall of 264.8 mm, Konasamandar received 227 mm and Jakranpalli 222.3 mm rainfall.

“Fortunately, there was no loss of human lives, but the extremely heavy rain in a short span of time resulted in destruction of crops, damages to roads and houses,” the minister said.

He instructed the district authorities to shift the people in low-lying areas to relief centres and arrange food and water for them. Similarly, those who were living in dilapidated buildings would be moved to safer places, he said.

Elsewhere in the state, Kapula Kanaparthy in Warangal received 294.3 mm, Kunur in Jangaon district recorded 242.5 mm and Sangem in Warangal 238 mm rainfall from Monday evening to Tuesday morning.

IMD Hyderabad director Nagarathna said several districts like Mahabubabad, Warangal, Hanumakonda, Khammam, Nalgonda, Suryapet, Rangareddy, Vikarabad, Sangareddy, Medak and Kamareddy would receive heavy to very heavy rainfall in the next three days. “We have sounded an orange alert for these districts,” she said.

Similarly, districts like Mulugu, Bhadradri Kothagudem, Khammam, Nalgonda, Suryapet, Jangaon, Siddipet, Bhadradri Kothagudem, Warangal, Hanumakonda, Kamareddy, Karimnagar, Peddapalli, Mancherial, Nirmal, Nalgonda, Hyderabad, Medchal Malkajgiri and Mahabubnagar would also receive heavy rainfall. “The situation will continue till Friday or may be beyond,” she said.

She said the heavy to very heavy rains were due to an upper air cyclonic circulation over West Central Bay and its adjoining areas. “This upper air circulation is likely to intensify wind towards low-pressure areas during the next 24 hours. This extends up to 7.6 km above mean sea level,” she said.

The Monday’s night heavy rainfall ranging up from 35 mm to 70 mm in different parts of Hyderabad resulted in inundation of several low-lying areas in Hyderabad, bringing normal life to a halt.

Rain water entered residential areas in Saidabad and Singareni Officers colony, causing severe hardships to residents. A similar situation prevailed in Kodandaram Nagar and a few colonies in Saroornagar area. Some colonies in Gajularamaram and Malkampet were also inundated. People were shifted to safe places from low-lying inundated area.

There were traffic snarls at several places, especially in the Information technology corridors of Madhapur, Gachibowli, Raidurgam and surrounding areas for hours. The area had seen a gridlock after heavy rains last night. Similar situation was witnessed in Financial District, Jubilee Hills, Banjara Hills, Bengumpet, Mehdipatnam, Punjagutta, Koti, Abids and other areas.

One person died when asbestos sheets fell on him at Abids, when he was taking shelter near a wall. The deceased was identified as Fareed, a daily wager.

Personnel from Disaster Response Force (DRF) teams of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and the police worked all through the night to clear the fallen trees and water stagnation points.

The study also predicted an extremely heavy rainfall of 1,740.62 mm, occuring in the year 2040, which is almost eight times more than what the city has received in August 2020 (241.5mm). This has been attributed to drastic climate changes and also the increase in land use.

Buildings and roads have highly susceptible areas of 57.59 percent and 22.76 Sq kms and the inundated area is 442.53 km2 , with flood depth ranging between 0.1–8m, found Dr Madhuri Rampalli, who conducted this study under the guidance of Professors K. Srinivasa Raju and A. Vasan of the Department of Civil Engineering.

She suggested Waterproofing the buildings under the high risk category, diverting the water to resource filtration basins, wells, for ground water recharging, as mitigation measures. The total cost of waterproofing the high risk category buildings is Rs. 4,964.60 cr, the study estimated.

FSBR is a combined index for evaluating flood susceptibility and building risk simultaneously to understand the impact of the flood, according to climate change aspects based on the General Circulation Model (GCM, GFDL-CM3), and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6).

For the study, GHMC area was divided into 16 zones and it found the most vulnerable locations to flooding are situated near the Hussain Sagar and Musi River. Kothapet, Mansoorabad, Falaknuma, Kacheguda and Begum Bazar have high percentage inundation areas as they are near the Musi River and exist in low-lying areas.

According to the study, the highest number of High Risk buildings were found in Falaknuma, Kacheguda and Begum Bazar Zones, followed by Kothapet, Mansoorabad zones. Greater number of Low Risk buildings were found in Gachibowli, Vanasthalipuram and Kapra zones as they are at relatively higher elevations.

Chandanagar has the least percentage of inundation area due to its high elevation level. Kukatpally has flood depth of 0.3 - 8m, and Vidyanagar and Ramnagar have flood depths of 0.2 – 6.8m. This is due to rapid urbanization in these zones, the study found.



Meanwhile, Prof Dr D Vijay Kishore from the Jawaharlal Nehru Architecture and Fine Arts University said that in view of the rapid expansion of the city and a new city all together taking shape abutting the ORR towards the west, Government should work in tandem with all stakeholders to come up with an emphasis on underground drainage system, smooth run of surface water and also on the low lying areas. “ We have to see what is happening in Delhi, Mumbai and several other places and prepare a plan for our city accordingly,” he added.

Authorities have opened 12 floodgates of Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar on the Musi River to release water downstream, as the twin reservoirs were receiving a significant influx of water due to incessant rain.

The city has been experiencing rainfall since Monday. Hyderabad Metro Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) opened six gates of Osman Sagar to release water downstream by two feet. At 1 p.m. on Tuesday, the inflow was recorded at 1,500 cusecs, while the outflow was 1,380 cusecs.

The water level of Osman Sagar was at 1,789.20 ft, just below the full tank level of 1,790 ft.

Himayat Sagar is also receiving substantial inflows from upstream due to heavy rain. According to officials, the reservoir received 4,000 cusecs of inflow, leading to the opening of six crest gates to release 4,120 cusecs downstream.

The water level in Himayat Sagar reached its full tank level (FTL) of 1,763.50 ft.

Following the opening of the twin reservoir gates, authorities have issued alerts to people living in the riverbed and areas along the riverbanks, which run through the city.

Advertisement Hyderabad Mayor Vijayalaxmi Gadwal directed officials of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) to notify residents in the Musi River-adjacent areas. Residents in certain Chaderghat areas along the banks of the Musi River were advised to relocate to safer locations.

Meanwhile, GHMC officials closely monitored the water level in Hussain Sagar Lake in the heart of the city. Water levels in Hussain Sagar reached nearly its full tank level, hitting 513.42 meters. The lake has almost reached its Full Tank Level (FTL) of 514.75 meters, receiving substantial inflows from various stormwater drains due to incessant rain.

This marks the second time this season that Hussain Sagar has nearly filled to capacity while the gates of the twin reservoirs were opened.

The city experienced heavy rainfall in July, and after more than a month of dry weather, rain resumed on Monday.

The intense downpour has disrupted normal life in the state capital, leading to the inundation of low-lying areas in various parts of the city and its outskirts.

HYDERABAD: Responding to queries from TOI readers Arvind Kumar, special chief secretary, municipal administration and urban development, say that flooding will be substantially reduced in the city once the ongoing works completeHyderabad, once a city adorned with lakes, has become a city of flats, malls, etc. , partly due to urbanization but mostly due to the indiscriminate encroachments of lakes, waterways, etc.Can the government reclaim the encroached lakes and restore them?— S Ravi ShankarHyderabad is one of the few cities which can boast of having 185 lakes and about 1000 lakes within the HMDA area since the Kakatiya dynasty. While the construction isn’t permitted within Full Tank Level (FTL)/ tank bed/in the buffer, there are 14061 constructions, mostly small residential constructions, identified through Satellite maps. After the massive flooding of October 2020, a total of 35 works costing Rs 985 crore are taken up and most of them are completed. In the surrounding ULBs also, another 19 works costing Rs 238 crore are taken up. Government is committed to making these lakes clean of encroachmentsA total of 60 lakes within GHMC and peripheral areas within HMDA areas are being adopted for comprehensive development by the corporates, builders, and developers under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and the works are going on. These include inter-alia, strengthening the bund, protecting the FTL & the buffer, improving the greenery around the lakes, and economic adaptation of areas within the buffer. The Lake development of Durgam Cheruvu, Madhapur and Malkam Cheruvu, Gachibowli are examples of such initiatives. It’s a win-win situation where the value and eco-sustainability and enhancement of the property also go up.Presently, as per our building permission provisions, in the case of residential apartments33% of the built-up area, and in the case of commercial buildings – 66% or 44% of the built-up area is earmarked for parking either in stilt or basement floors. These mandatory parking provisions in Telangana are among the highest in the country. I agree that street parking, especially around pubs, breweries, and restaurants is an issue and on-street parking is not regulated in the state. We are in the process of consulting police to bring in a regulated discipline on-street parking including declaring designated parking places and provisions for levying penalties and shall be coming out with detailed guidelines soon.Because of the ongoing box-drain works under SNDP , the main water pipeline and subsequently, the water supply to branches especially on Road No. 2,3 and 4 of Venkataraman Colony were affected since May 17, 2023. The water supply is already restored to the colonies in Road No. 2 and 3 and the restoration for Road No. 4 is being taken up now. In the meanwhile, the HMWSSB is arranging free water tankers to the affected colonies on alternate days to meet the domestic requirements of the citizens.I agree with not so scientific cutting of branches and they're not being cleared. We will ensure regular convergence meetings between GHMC and TSSPDCL at zonal/ circle and ward levels to not only ensure that cleared branches are removed but also a more scientific and environment-friendly way of pruning these trees.In GHMC we have about 1000 parks of which only ten major parks have a nominal entry fee of Rs 10 for adults & Rs 2 for children as per the decision by the Corporation. The objective is to ensure proper maintenance & ensure against illegal usage. Entry is free in all other parks.It is a fact that there are instances of reverse flow of drain water and water entering apartment cellars in Pragathi Nagar during heavy rains. There are 7 major outlets from Pragathi Nagar to drain out this water from colonieswhich were laid during the time of erstwhile Grampanchayat without a comprehensive drainage plan and building activity. We have now started working on increasing the drainage capacity and rectifying the old drains by replacing them with proper box drains.While the construction of rainwater harvesting structures is mandatory in apartments, institutional and commercial complexes, GHMC / HMDA / ULBs have taken up the construction of rainwater harvesting pits in all the parks, public offices, and government spaces. There are some concerns about their proper upkeep / regular maintenance to realise their full potential and we have instructed our engineering staff to look into it.In GHMC, the water logging during heavy rains won’t last more than 30 minutes. However, trash and other wastes thrown indiscriminately often clog drains thus hampering this drainage process. GHMC deploys 200 static labour teams, 157 Monsoon Emergency Teams, and 30 Teams of Disaster Relief Force to take care of any monsoon-related issues. The number of vulnerable points has come down substantially in recent years. The ongoing drain works under SNDP will further minimise the impact of heavy rains.GHMC as a policy hands over maintenance of colony parks to RWAs. CCTV installation is taken up across the city the and parks are prioritised to cover with CCTV network.Flyovers and bridges are taken up under Strategic Road Development Programme (SRDP) and are not at the cost of internal/colony roads. GHMC spends an average of Rs 350-400 crore per annum exclusively for the construction/ maintenance of internal colony roads. As the total road network is more than 9000 KM and there are often road cuttings, the process of maintaining the internal roads requires coordination with other departments and there might be a lag in a few cases. Regarding the maintenance of main roads, the GHMC has outsourced the same to reputed engineering agencies.To control the street dog population and prevent Rabies disease, the Government of Telangana conducts the Animal Birth Control-cum-Anti Rabies (ABC-AR) program in all its Municipal Corporations and most of the Municipalities. Under the ABCAR Program, after post-operative care, the sterilized dogs are released back to the same areas from where they were picked up as per the rules. Shifting dogs to one place is no solution as dogs are territorial and another set of dogs will come in once the existing ones are shifted. Moreover, the level of aggression and unease will be manifold in such dislocated dogs.The growth of any city is measured by the percentage of its citizens using public transport. It is about37% at present in Hyderabad and we wish to increase it to 50% in the next 5 years by undertaking several measures including an additional proposed metro line from the BHEL colony to Lakdi-Ka-Pul, extending the metro to the old city, increasing the number of coaches from present 3 to 6 (the government is insisting the PPP partner L&T and they are in the process of hiring additional coaches from Nagpur) and improving the last mile connectivity.Regarding designated parking complexes, we have proposed to take up Multi Level Parking Complexes (MLPCs) to resolve parking issues at public congregation places. One complex is nearing completion at Nampally. Tenders have been called for two more parking complexes near Charminar and these will be commenced shortly. Another 17 locations have been finalised to take up MLPCs across the city under Public Private Partnership mode. We also encourage land owners who have open lands along with main roads to come forward and have an MOU with GHMC for the usage of such lands as designated parking places.SNDP is a specialised project aimed at alleviating and preventing floods. The works at the underpass on the road leading to Manasarovar Heights will be completed in all aspects by August 10. Streetlights shall also be arranged.While 35 works that were of immediate priority in terms of the impact were taken up under SDNP Phase I costing Rs 985. 48 crore, the state government is planning to take up SNDP Phase II to take water logging issues in the remaining vulnerable areas including Sainagar and Attapur.The drainage improvement work was taken up in Kousalya colony, Pragathi Nagar under SNDP.

Making a statement in the House after a discussion on the devastation caused by heavy rains and floods last month, state roads and buildings minister Vemula Prashant Reddy said in all 44 persons had lost their lives during the floods, the maximum number of deaths being in Mulugu district, followed by six in Hanamkonda.

The minister said the government had announced an ex gratia of ₹5 lakh to each of the families of the deceased, besides paying ₹10,000 to each family towards damage caused to the properties.

He said Moranchapalli village in Jayashankar Bhupalpally district was totally inundated due to flash floods to Moranchavagu on account of heavy rains on the night of July 26 and 27. “Three persons died and one person is still missing in the village,” he said.

Reddy said there were breaches and damage to as many as 756 minor irrigation tanks and canals, which required ₹178 crore for restoration. In all, 768 roads, highways, bridges and buildings suffered damages and it required ₹253.77 crore for temporary restoration and ₹1771.47 crore for permanent restoration.

With regard to the rural road network, 1,517 roads were damaged, which required ₹1526.74 crore for restoration. With regard to power lines and poles, the damage was to the extent of ₹62.98 crore. Similarly, there was a livestock loss to the tune of ₹38.51 crore, he said, adding the extent of damages to the crops, including horticulture, was yet to be assessed.

In the urban local bodies, the heavy rains caused severe destruction of culverts, sewerage lines, drains, streetlights and culverts and the loss was estimated to be around ₹380 crore.

In Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits, there was a loss to the properties and infrastructure to the extent of ₹256.66 crore, the minister said.

Reddy claimed that the state government had taken relief and rehabilitation measures on war footing and released an amount of ₹500 crore towards immediate relief. “The officials and the field-level staff worked round the clock to take up relief operations in the flood-affected areas and ensured that there was no heavy loss of life,” he said.

The minister alleged that despite such a heavy loss, the Central government had not released even a single rupee to the state government towards immediate relief, while it had liberally released funds to the BJP-ruled states whenever there were such natural calamities.

“Between 2018 and 2022, the Centre had released ₹44,219 crore to various BJP-ruled states towards flood relief, but had not shown any mercy towards Telangana. Even during September 2016 and October 2020 floods, there was heavy damage to the crops and properties in Telangana to the extent of ₹8,851 crore, but the Centre had not released any extra funds other than the State Calamity Relief Fund,” he said.

The Strategic Nala Development Programme (SNDP) works, wherever they have been completed within the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits, have helped prevent flooding to a large extent, as seen from the ground.

The SNDP was taken up as a firefighting measure post the devastating floods of October 2020 and involved securing the neglected and encroached stormwater drains wherever possible, and providing alternative solutions where widening was not a solution.

Though the current spate of rains has manifested in another nightmare of flooding and traffic jams, residents from areas where SNDP works are completed are thankful that they are not part of it. “Since the pipelines were laid transferring the flows to the Bandlaguda Lake, we are able to sleep peacefully without fear of inundation. Earlier, there would be this constant fear that the supplies would perish if the shop got flooded,” said P.Chandrashekhar, a grocery store owner in Mansurabad.

Earlier, the Mansurabad Lake would receive flood water from a large catchment of Vanasthalipuram, Chintalkunta and other areas, and insufficiency of surplus channels would inundate the surrounding colonies when there were heavy rains. Besides, the narrow box drain constructed earlier, was unable to carry the flows to the lake, which resulted in flooding of Chintalkunta road.

Before SNDP works began, another box drain was constructed alongside the older one, connecting to Mansurabad Lake. This posed another challenge, in flooding of Ayyappa Colony, which was settled right in the FTL of Bandlaguda Lake downstream of Mansurabad Lake.

As part of SNDP, surplus channels between Mansurabad Lake and Bandlaguda Lake, and from there up to Nagole Lake were fortified and box drains were provided wherever necessary. This has resolved the major problem of inundation in several areas.

“Many residents here had lost many valuables and shifted to neighbouring locality when their houses were flooded in 2021. Some even sold off their houses at cheap prices. Thankfully, the problem is resolved now,” said Harikrishna, another resident of Ayyappa Colony.

As per the engineering officials from GHMC who carried out this humongous task within a short time, another part of the work, to lay a second drain from Nagole Lake to Musi River is in progress. Once finished, colonies in Nagole too would be saved from inundation.

Of the 37 works taken up by GHMC under SNDP, a total 24 works have been completed so far, including the well known Appa Cheruvu, Picket nala, and Fox Sagar Lake.

There are also areas which have not received complete relief from flooding, such as colonies downstream of Saroornagar lake. Under SNDP, a box drain was constructed from the lake up to Chaitanyapuri culvert, and the culvert was cleared of encroachments to aid free flow. Besides, part of the inflows into the lake were diverted and taken to Musi River directly, officials informed.

Nevertheless, the colonies downstream of Saroornagar lake experienced inundation in the current spate of heavy rains, when sluices of the lake were lifted to let out excess water.

Officials say that construction of another sluice below FTL is in progress, in order to empty part of the lake ahead of the rains, which will address the flooding issue completely.",solution,2023 Hyderabad floods,"Hyderabad, Telangana","July 25, 2023","July 26, 2023","['Vanasthalipuram', 'Chintalkunta', 'Mansurabad', 'Ayyappa Colony', 'Nagole']","['100 mm, 150 mm, 200 mm']","['$10 million', '$20 million', '$30 million']","['1, 2, 3']","['Flooding of homes and businesses', 'Damage to infrastructure', 'Loss of livelihoods']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Skies poured down on the city for hours on Thursday, turning streets into streams, residential areas into lakes and roads into virtual mayhem.

What continued for the past three days as drizzle turned into heavy rain on Thursday, throwing the whole city off the gear. Initially, the downpour hit Northern and part of the Central city during early hours, recording a maximum of 9 cm rainfall at Miyapur.

Morning commuters experienced traumatic hours caught in traffic gridlocks everywhere, more so in Serilingampally, where heavy water logging closed the RUB for the vehicles. Slow traffic was reported from other areas such as Rasoolpura, Begumpet, Mehdipatnam, Khairatabad, Madhapur, Gachibowli and other stretches.

Post noon, the clouds spread to cover the entire city to pound it for the next three hours without a break. Heavy water logging and inundations were reported from across several areas, especially Krishna Nagar, Nizampet and Lingampally. Gusty winds resulted in several tree falls and collapse of electrical poles, which led to power outages everywhere.

Major thoroughfares inundated

Major thoroughfares were inundated near Legislative Assembly, Punjagutta, Ameerpet, Nampally, Jubilee Hills, Begumpet, Gajularamaram, Malakpet, Abids and other areas. The recently altered road in front of the newly built State Secretariat was an apparent failure in terms of planning, as evidenced by heavy water logging which was not there earlier.

Chaos prevailed on roads everywhere during evening peak too, with tedious traffic movement testing the patience of commuters. Traffic police worked overtime aiding the municipal staff in clearing the water, but with little result.

The Disaster Response wing of GHMC has received total 45 complaints, including two wall collapse incidents in which nobody was injured. The other complaints were tree falls (28), and water stagnation (15). The Directorate of Enforcement, Vigilance and Disaster Management (EV&DM) has circulated its contacts for people to call when in distress (9000113667, 040-29555500, 040-29560528, 040-29560584 or 040-29560591). The wing may be reached through social media too.

As per the information available at 8 p.m., East Anandbagh area of Malkajgiri recorded the highest rainfall at over 11 centimetres, followed by Miyapur and Nacharam where more than 10 centimetres of rainfall was recorded. Majority of the localities in the city clocked over 7 centimetres of rainfall, which is the highest ever in the current monsoons.

Meteorology department predicted generally cloudy sky, and moderate to heavy rain at times turning into intense spells for the city for the coming 24 hours. State government declared July 21 and 22 as public holidays fro all educational institutions and government/private offices in Hyderabad in view of the predictions.

Mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi urged citizens not to venture out unless absolutely necessary. A total 426 monsoon emergency teams are working on the ground to clear water stagnation, apart from 157 static teams deployed at points of frequent water logging, she informed. The status of all the 185 lakes is being monitored, and water is being released in advance where there is a need, she said, assuring that she is reviewing the situation with zonal and deputy commissioners and engineering officials.

Twin reservoirs unaffected

A statement from the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board assured that the twin reservoirs of Osmansagar and Himayatsagar remained unaffected by the downpour. So far, no surplus water has reached the tanks, the statement said, and estimated that the inflows may start from early hours of Friday. Officials concerned are on the alert and reviewing the situation from time to time, it said.

Managing Director of the HMWS&SB M. Dana Kishore reviewed the situation with the officials, and asked them to keep the emergency response teams on the alert in view of heavy rains. Special attention needs to be paid to the quality of drinking water too in view of the unremitting rains, he said. He asked officials to ensure safety grilles on the manholes, and to clear the silt removed from the manholes. Warning signs should be placed near the inundated manholes and sewerage supervisors should be posted at all the deep manholes, he directed. He warned against unauthorised opening of manhole covers which would attract criminal cases. If any open manhole is noticed, it may be notified to the water board on 155313.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

As a part of their construction, they surreptitiously, unilaterally and without authorization blocked the century-old sewage pipe-line that until then serviced and carried the sewage water from the ‘Dar-E-Meher’ and its neighbouring residential colony which houses 45 Zoroastrian families,"" said the BPP letter.The letter said the dirty sewage water is unable to pass through and therefore back-flows into the holy Fire Temple complex. ""It has thoroughly contaminated the water of our holy well which is situated in the Fire Temple complex. The well water which to us is cardinal to the performance of our Zoroastrian-Parsi-Irani religious ceremonies, its contamination has thus deeply hurt the religious sentiments of all the members of our community in India & abroad,"" it said.The 45 families living in the adjacent housing complex have been living in conditions of ""utter filth"" due to the mess created by the backward flow of the sewage water causing health and hygiene-related issues, particularly for the old people and young children staying in the complex.""Our efforts to approach local authorities to resolve this issue have failed. On behalf of the Parsi-Irani-Zoroastrian community of India collectively, we humbly pray and now approach you to kindly intervene in the matter and help resolve this issue amicably so that the religious sentiments of the members of our community in India & abroad are duty addressed and assuaged,"" said the BPP.Hyderabad-based community activist Jehangir Bisney recently initiated a signature campaign addressed to the MD of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board. ""Besides being a place of historical, cultural and architectural significance (it was recognized with the HUDA Heritage Building Award in 2001); more importantly, this 119-year-old Agiary housed a consecrated fire which is the source of veneration and worship for the Parsi community residing in Hyderabad & Secunderabad,"" it said.""The spiritual stature of the Agiary and the health and lives of the residents have been badly compromised since 2022 when their sewage line, laid over a century ago, was intentionally and unlawfully blocked by Santosh Dhaba, which shares the compound wall. The outlet having been blocked, the sewage water flows right back into the compound of the Agiary, polluting the well water, besides posing a serious health hazard to the residents.""""Concerned individuals have been forced to raise the matter in the courts of law. While HMWSSB has committed to clearing the sewage by sending tankers, that definitely is not a solution to the problem. The municipal authorities are duty-bound to provide adequate civic amenities to residents on a daily basis. Towards that end, you are urged to do all in your power to stop this health hazard and enforce upon Santosh Dhaba to clear the blocked sewage system to allow free outlet.

The project will collect flood-related data, use advanced modelling techniques to predict rainfall patterns, flood depth and the extent of flooding, and will create models to meet the needs of policymakers and stakeholders.

One of the primary challenges faced in establishing a reliable UFIS is the scarcity of input data, such as high-resolution rainfall measurements and flood flow data. To bridge this gap, the team has introduced SnapFlood, a platform that encourages citizens to contribute flood-related information.

This crowdsourced data may eventually become an integral component of the UFIS. Additionally, efforts are being directed toward social media platforms, such as X (formerly Twitter), to extract flood information. In fact, Hyderabad made history by utilising Twitter to identify flood hotspots, a milestone presented at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) conference in 2021.

The research scholars affiliated with Dr Regonda's research group, Rainfall-runoff Analysis modelling and Forecasting Tools (RAFT), have been exploring various dimensions to tackle Hyderabad floods.

Mohammed Azharuddin has focused on studying climatological aspects of rainfall and understanding weather patterns that bring rain to the city, while Ponukumati Padmini has examined alternative rainfall products for their applicability in flood-related scenarios. The ongoing research includes weather, hydrology, and hydraulic modeling at an urban scale, along with real-time flood information dissemination through social media platforms.

Dr Regonda shared his vision, saying, ""Flooding disrupts cities, causing various types of damage, including loss of life. This highlights the necessity for systems like UFIS, which enhance a city's resilience to floods by integrating meteorological, hydrological, and stakeholders' aspects, ultimately developing products that raise flood awareness.""

At least three points on ORR service roads are flood-prone, say residents, pointing to Exit 4a at Mallampet, Exit 18A at Narsingi and Exit 17 near Himayat Sagar.Other spots like Movie Tower exit towards Vattinagulapally , Exit 2, Exit 7 and Taramatipet-Ghatkesar service road have also been waterlogged, causing trauma to commuters, who are often stranded without an escape route.Water accumulates because the stretch was originally a causeway or due to absence of stormwater drains, as per an analysis.One of the critical points is the service road near ORR's Exit 18A, which is often flooded by inflows from a Musi rivulet. ""The main ORR is at an altitude and is not affected by a deluge. But the causeway that hosts exit 18A is inundated every time Osman Sagar gates are opened. In the current rain spell, no alerts were issued, and many had to plough their vehicles through rising waters as there's no option for a U-turn,"" said a resident, who drove through the tide.At exit 4A in Mallampet, the hinterland is flooded every time it rains. During the recent downpour, the sole underpass and service road under ORR that links Mallampet, Bachupally towards Shambipur was forced to shut down after heavy inflows from Mallampet lake. ""The cheruvu breached its banks and the adjacent service road alongside Praneeth Pranav Leaf residential community was flooded. On this stretch, the new exit 4A is under construction and if the site gets flooded, the exit is undermined,"" saidMaharshi Teja Jalla , a representative of Praneeth Pranav Lead Residential Association.Others who routinely use ORR service roads say that without a warning mechanism, a rainy day becomes a guessing game. ""On multiple occasions, I have driven to the service road only to realise that it's inundated by the reservoir water and have been forced to steer in the opposite direction. The administration must plan service roads on higher ground than rely on causeways. In the short term, alert systems are crucial,"" said Sai Koushik , who commutes from Attapur to the Financial District.Talking to TOI, Arvind Kumar, special chief secretary, MA&UD, said few exits plagued by recurring floods have been identified and rectified on a war footing. ""Last year, flooding was noticed at Pedda Golconda exit and it was swiftly rectified by raising its level. This year, there was no flooding there. Another exit which is flood-prone is the one near Kollur, where we have taken up work from R&B and addressed drainage issues. As for the Mallampet exit, it's still under construction and the stretch will be opened after excess flow from the lake is arrested,"" said Arvind Kumar.Service roads near Exit 18A near Narsingi and near Himayat Sagar downstream, are both causeways and designed to receive flood water from reservoirs.

A heritage walk will be held in Paithan, covering 31 sites of historical and mythological importance. Organized by various organizations, the walk aims to shed light on the heritage of the city and attract tourists. In Pune, heritage walks are being organized to explore the culture of Ganeshotsav, offering visits to iconic pandals and traditional snacks. Youngsters in Pune are also engaging in unique activities such as terrarium making and shibori workshops. Uttar Pradesh's tourism department plans to convert four heritage sites in Lucknow into tourism hotspots, including five-star hotels and cultural centers.

Mosques impart training on CPR

In an effort to combat sudden cardiac arrests, mosques in Vadodara, India, organized special training sessions to teach cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques. The Baroda Muslim Doctors Association (BMDA) aims to train one lakh (100,000) people in CPR. Currently, only two percent of the population knows CPR, despite 100 deaths per minute from sudden cardiac arrests in India. The training sessions were held at mosques and even at a madrasa, with plans to continue the program periodically. Similar initiatives have also been undertaken in Ahmedabad, Patna, and Mumbai.

Delhi HC notice on plea for protecting heritage buildings in Walled City

The Delhi High Court has issued a notice on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking protection for heritage properties in Old Delhi. The court has asked various authorities, including the Ministry of Culture, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), and Delhi Development Authority (DDA), to respond to the PIL. The petitioner claims that encroachment by businesses is damaging the heritage value of the properties, which include haveli structures. The petitioner has requested the eviction of traders illegally occupying the properties. The court has listed the matter for hearing on December 7th.

Hyderabad: A heritage walk by Deccan Archive , a city-based non-profit organisation, brought to life the tragic memories of the catastrophic floods that swept through the Old City on September 28, 1908, claiming the lives of over 15,000 people within a mere six hours. The heritage walk, ‘Tughyani Sitambar’ (Deluge of September),was led by architect and heritage enthusiast Sibghat Khan and heritage activist Anuradha Reddy.The calamity was triggered by a cyclonic storm formed over the Bay of Bengal, unleashing a staggering 27 inches of rainfall upon the Deccan region, submerging everything in its path, recounted Sibghat Khan. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, various markers were installed at strategic locations, serving as poignant reminders of the flood’s monumental impact.The heritage walk commenced at Masjid-e-Miayan Mushk, a mosque located adjacent to the Musi River. “The mosque bore witness to the highest flood level (HFL) of 14 feet 5 inches. From the riverbed to the pinnacle of the minaret at the gate, everything was engulfed by the relentless waters,” said Khan. The HFL marker was etched onto the minaret, memorialising the tragic event.Reddy elaborated on the architectural significance of the mosque, highlighting its inspiration drawn from Qutb Shahi and Kakatiya architecture. “This mosque, an architectural marvel, stood as a silent sentinel during those trying times,” she added.Similarly, the second HFL marker stood opposite the mosque, beneath the ‘Purana pul,’ at a height of 12 feet above the riverbed. “While everything around it succumbed to the deluge, the ‘Purana pul,’ previously known as ‘Sirat-al-Mustaqim,’ remained steadfast due to its robust foundation, established in the 1560s. It suffered only minor damage to the parapet level,” Khan added.The third marker was situated at the ‘Purana Pul Darwaza,’ the last surviving gateway of the city, with an HFL mark at 13 feet 9 inches. Inscriptions by Chandu Lal, the then governor of the city, adorn the right side of the gateway, detailing the construction and restoration efforts after the devastating floods.The final marker is perched on an elevated road, towering over 14 feet above the road level, in front of Hussaini Alam, Bohra Sarai, a location referred to as ‘zero mile’ by Khan.We also published the following articles recently",flood,Hyderabad Floods of 1908,"Hyderabad, India","September 28, 1908","September 29, 1908",Old City of Hyderabad,27 inches,"15,000+ deaths",,Submerged everything in its path,Markers installed at strategic locations to memorialise the tragic event,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

From a flow level of 5 cubic metres per second it increased to over 70 cubic metres per second.“The main takeaway from the study has been that since land in Hyderabad is increasingly concretised, water is rapidly flowing into nalas. Simultaneously, since nalas are encroached their carrying and emptying capacities have reduced. All these factors along with frequent extreme rain events make such sensors a great tool to predict flow of water,” said professor M Gopal Naik who heads the project undertaken by OU civil engineering department.He suggests that if a rain gauge as one fixed by Telangana State Development and Planning Society is fixed on the 16-18 odd major naalas (Kukatpally, Picket, Indira Park, Nacharam, ECIL etc) in GHMC along with these flow sensors, the officials can see the flow in the drains real time and predict its future flow based on rainfall data and take informed call on evacuating people to avoid loss of life.“Based on modeling systems we are also preparing a 30 year prediction of vulnerable areas in GHMC,” added Naik.He further recommended these to be fixed on Musi river as well to develop flood alert systems and evacuate people living adjacent to Musi in time. “At the rubber dam, Chaderghat and under Nagole flyover these sensors, if placed, could be highly useful in making the city ready against rapid urban flooding,” he said.",solution,Hyderabad Floods 2020,"Hyderabad, Telangana, India","October 14, 2020","October 15, 2020","['Begumpet', 'Balkampet']","['100 mm, 150 mm']","['$10 million', '$20 million']","['10, 20']","['Thousands of people were displaced from their homes.', 'Infrastructure was damaged.', 'Businesses were closed.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

What started as a drizzle on the morning of July 26 turned into torrential rain by the night. Mohammed Raheem living in Projectnagar village of Mulugu district in north-eastern Telangana, decided to shift his flock of sheep to an adjacent hilly area.

Even as the rain came down in sheets, the shepherd stepped out of the bamboo-roof hut. He took his oldest child, a six-year-old son, Sadiq Pasha, to the elevated place, asking his wife Fauzia to remain in the hut and take care of the other two children, a 4- and 3-year-old, Tanvir and Saddam.

While some, even the elderly, walked up to the forest nearby, others went up the double-storey school building. “The mother with her two tiny tots remained in the hut. She was unaware that the hut was in a low-lying area,” Mulugu Sub-Divisional Police Officer N. Ravinder recalled.

The flood water entered the hut and continued to rise by the next morning. Scared for their safety, Fauzia climbed atop the hut’s bamboo-sheet roof. “She was holding Tanvir with one arm and Saddam with the other. Around 5.45 a.m., the speeding, swirling waters swept away the hut, the mother, and the two children,” the officer explained.

That evening, little Saddam’s body was found a kilometre away. Fauzia’s body was traced the next day, and that of toddler Saddam surfaced in the water four days later, leaving villagers shell shocked. Little did they or villagers of Kondai, located a few kilometres downstream, realise that an even bigger tragedy was going to unfold.

Having recorded the highest rainfall of 64.98 cm — from 8 a.m. on July 26 to 8 a.m. on July 27 — in the history of the State, the district was devastated with road breaches, destroyed houses, and traumatised families. State Revenue Secretary, in a report presented in Telangana High Court in PIL petition, stated out of total 41 rain-related deaths in the State, 15 were from Mulugu, the district with lowest population in the State.

The main reason for the flood was the Godavari tributary, the Jampanna Vagu that begins from the Laknavaram lake in Mulugu district. With lush green crops on both sides, the 35 km long river is about 15-20 metres wide at its narrowest point and 60 metres wide at the Medaram bridge. Originally called the Lakhnavaram river, the current name stuck because the local tribes believe Jampanna, a warrior and son of tribal goddess Sammakka died fighting the Kakatiya army in Medaram, another village in the Mulugu district.

Rain bucketed down in major parts of Mulugu district on July 27 and 28. Strangely, there was not a single drop in Kondai village. Most of the nearly 100 families there are marginal farmers living in tiled-roof or thatched-roof mud houses. Some raise cattle to meet home needs of milk. Almost every house rears farm chicks. Dodla and Kondai villages are on either side of Jampanna Vagu.

Hamlet Malyala, at a higher level, is connected to Kondai by a recently laid gravel road with a culvert of cement concrete pipes down the middle. Coming after a long dry spell, the rains in the last week of July lit up everyone’s faces in Telangana. Equally happy were Kondai villagers on learning of heavy rains in their Mulugu district.

Soon, the mood changed. An uneasy anxiety crept into them as the Jampanna Vagu flood water began entering their fields. “Over 100 villagers went up to a double-storeyed building for safety. Some decided to walk up to adjacent Malyala,” said sarpanch K. Venkateshwarlu. By 1.30 p.m on July 27, the river flood water was overflowing on to the road connecting to Malyala. Though the water was waist deep, they dared to cross since they had been using the road for the past several years.

While Venkateshwarlu was overseeing shifting operations in the village, his wife Rama Devi along with her sexagenarian mother D. Sammakka walked towards the road along with some villagers. Holding hands, they entered the waist deep water. “Somehow, they stepped onto the deep soil abutting the culvert, lost balance while a wave pulled them into the gushing water,” her family said.

While struggling in the water, Devi caught hold of her mother’s hair and tried to save her. But the strong current pushed her mother away. Devi too was washed away, but got entwined in the agriculture motor wires about 100 metres away. “We were shouting, crying as people trying to wade through the water were being swept away in front of our eyes in broad daylight,” said B. Sarayya and B. Narayana of Malyala said.

Rasheed Khan and his wife Kareema Bee too were crossing the culvert with others when sudden surging water turned them upside down. “Rasheed was in his mid-50s but was well built. Being a swimmer, he came up from the spinning water, but his scared wife embraced him tightly,” one of the eyewitnesses explained. As they watched helplessly, the couple drowned even as Rasheed tried to swim ashore hugging his wife.

“It was heart wrenching to see the bodies of Rasheed and Kareema Bee in an embracing position 500 yards away after a few hours,” the sarpanch said.

Five more adults got washed away in a similar fashion within the next few minutes, notwithstanding attempts of the villagers to save them by throwing them ropes and long sticks. Teams of Mulugu police and members of the National Disaster Response Force tried to reach the village on learning of the tragedy. They had to stop at Dodla village with nearly half of the bridge (connecting Malyala and Kondai) over Jampanna Vagu getting washed away.

Mulugu witnessed a couple of more such distressing tragic deaths. Three of a family got washed away at Burugupet village of Venkatpur mandal following a breach of a tank. A watchman of a mango tree on the bank of Jampanna Vagu near Madaram bridge went up a tree to save his life from the deluge on July 26 night. “The next morning, there was no trace of him. Massive mounds of sand replaced the entire mango garden,” said a farmer, B. Keshavalu.

Devotees of Sammakka Sarakka, the tribal deities at Medaram, which witnesses a jathara (congregation) once in two years where lakhs of devotees gather, were worried as the Jampanna Vagu flood entered the temple. “Never in history has this happened,” said a roadside shop owner, Rathnakumari, adding that the tributary is usually dry. Life is limping back to normalcy as authorities are beginning to relay roads.

Kondia is still cut off from the rest of the world with the bridge connecting it with Dodla washed away in the floods. A person has to cross the river in a government-operated boat from Dodla and walk down a slushy road for 3 km to reach Kondai. “We can rebuild our houses. How can we bring back our loved ones lost in flood?” the devastated villagers say.

In the neighbouring district

Almost every one of the 980 villagers of Moranchapally, located along the National Highway 353C, 9 km from the coal town of Bhupalpally, has a traumatic near-death experience to narrate after the Morancha stream flash floods. It submerged the 2 km village stretch, leaving three dead and one missing. The ordeal unfolded at 3.45 a.m. on July 27 after the stream rose menacingly high, swamping the village. A crucial road link between Telangana and Maharashtra was also flooded and portions damaged due to the turbulent swirl of the stream.

The Morancha stream runs a course of nearly 23 kilometres originating from Ramappa lake-bed in Venkatapur mandal of Mulugu district. The flooding was preceded by unprecedented rainfall of 616.5 mm in the neighbouring Chityal mandal, 459.8 mm in Regonda mandal, and 457.0 mm in Chelpur in a 24-hour period, ending at 8.30 a.m. on July 27.

The record-breaking rains caused a breach in the Maredugudem tank, and several other tanks and lakes consequently overflowed in the upstream area, pushing up the water level in the Morancha stream, resulting in the flood havoc.

As the floodwaters raged around their huts, panic-stricken villagers climbed atop the roofs of a few houses. Some clung onto trees to escape death.

Those who managed to carry their mobile phones made distress calls to the “100” and their near and dear ones.

“My wife Mahalakshmi heard the roar of floodwaters virtually knocking at our door at about 3.45 a.m. on the ill-fated day. We both came out to climb up onto the roof,” said Gaddam Srinivas, a sand quarry worker, who escaped death by a whisker. “When we opened the door, the floodwaters gushed in prompted us to grab hold of a small tree right in front of our house.”

That saved them for nearly half an hour before a dead buffalo came along with the flood flow hitting his wife, he recalled. “She vanished in the deluge before I could do anything,” Srinivas said, his voice choking. It has been almost a week, but his wife is still untraceable despite a vigorous search operations by the police in the downstream of Moranchavagu.

“We endured heavy rain, stranded on the terrace of our house with our children and parents for almost seven hours till the rescue teams reached our village in inflatable boats,” said Devender, another survivor.

The deluge swept away everything which came its way: household articles, electronic appliances, cars, bikes, gold ornaments, and important papers.

Devender lives with the guilt of the survivor: “Our neighbours [Gorre Odireddy, 70, and his wife Vajramma, 60] were washed away while trying to reach high ground,” he said detailing heart-rending scenes that emerged during the flood havoc.

“My 75-year-old mother Sarojana, who was bed-ridden, was washed away after the deluge barrelled through the hutment she was sleeping in,” said Kausalya, her daughter, crying.

Members of about 20 families of the Chenchu tribe from the village are the worst hit. “We woke up to a nightmare after the surging floodwaters encircled our hutments in the predawn hours and all of us fled the spot, scaled a compound wall of a building in our neighbourhood, and somehow reached a rooftop,” said Ramaswamy, a middle-aged man of a Chenchu family. But he is thinking ahead, pleading with the government to allot two-bedroom houses to them.

“I had witnessed flash floods in Moranchavagu in 1983 and 2000 but our houses were spared from the deluge both times,” said Ravinder Reddy, a local farmer. This time, he said, the speed of the deluge was unusual as the stream rapidly swelled within an hour, changing its course, submerging the village.

In the ensuing rescue operations around noon on July 27, all the stranded villagers were ferried to flood relief camps at Karakpalli and Gandhinagar in Ghanpur mandal in inflatable boats. Two Indian Air Force helicopters were also pressed into service to aid the rescue and relief operations.

The government announced a ₹4 lakh ex-gratia to the kin of those killed in the flash floods in Moranchapally and disbursed a financial assistance of ₹10,000 each to about 320 families affected by the deluge. Official sources said a compensation of ₹30,000 for the loss of cattle will be paid soon.

Widespread damage was caused to crops in over 33,500 acres; 486 houses were partially and 42 houses fully damaged; 1,164 poultry and cattle died; 110 km of roads were damaged in the Jayashankar Bhupalpally district.

Nurseries of chilly and paddy spread over nearly 7,000 acres got damaged in Mulugu. While 45 houses got destroyed, 258 houses were partially damaged in the floods. Minister Satyavathi Rathod camped at Mulugu for two consecutive days overseeing relief measures. Mulugu MLA D. Anasuya alias Seethakka visited every affected village.

Though the floodwaters receded the next day with a lull in the torrential rains, the ravaged village has been hit by gloom. The survivors are struggling to remove the heaps of sludge piled in their damaged houses, salvaging whatever they can.

“We are staring at an uncertain future. Our cattle, the prime source of our livelihood, is lost,” said Lalitha, one of the survivors, as she slowly starts the cleaning process.

Hyderabad: Flooding of low-lying areas in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district have prompted authorities to shift 60 families to relief camps, amid continuous rains lashing Telangana which left several pockets of the state waterlogged, disrupting the normal life. Weather office has predicted more rains till Friday.

Chief Secretary A Santhi Kumari chaired a rain situation meeting which was attended by senior officials from various departments, besides District Collectors, Superintendents of Police, and Commissioners of Police. DGP Anjani Kumar said 60 families in two villages of Charla area of Bhadradri-Kothagudem district were shifted to the camps, an official release said.

Like Tuesday, several low-lying areas remained submerged at Warangal and other places in the state following the downpour. The waterbodies were brimming with water while rivulets and other streams continued to be in spate disrupting road links. In Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, a woman was washed away while crossing an overflowing stream.

Santhi Kumari directed the District Collectors and police officers to step up vigil and be on high alert as the Met department has warned of heavy rains in many parts of the state in the next 48 hours. ""Measures should be taken to prevent loss of life or property. Many projects, ponds, dams and canals in Godavari basin are already flowing at full water level and that they are likely to overflow due to heavy rains in the next two days,"" a released quoted Santhi Kumari as saying.

She advised the Collectors to shift people in low-lying areas and flood-prone areas to safety. She instructed the Collector of Bhadradri-Kothagudem district should review the water levels in Godavari river and take appropriate precautionary measures, given the recorded rise of 43 feet in water levels due to the overflowing Godavari river. ""Sanitation works should be carried out vigorously in all the villages,"" the CS advised.

In Hyderabad-Already drenched for several days now, Telangana witnessed intense rainfall from Wednesday evening with MeT predicting more heavy showers in the entire state for the next 48 hours. In Hyderabad, the Met Centre said heavy to very heavy rain and at times intense spells are very likely to occur between 1600 hours of July 26 to 0830 hours of July 27.

Hyderabad district, according to the weather warning issued by Telangana State Development Planning Society (TSDPS), will witness extremely heavy rainfall ranging from 115.60 mm to 204.40 mm on Thursday, with the downpour expected to continue until Friday morning. In the districts of Hanumakonda, Warangal, Mahabubabad, Khammam, and Bhadradri Kothagudem, even more intense heavy rainfall is anticipated.

In Alwal here, a man released a snake in GHMC ward office here, protesting the ""official apathy"" in addressing his complaint. The man caught the snake by himself after it reportedly entered his house brought it to the GHMC ward office in Alwal on Tuesday.

Over the past week, incessant rains have led to reservoirs and streams in the city being filled, but this has also caused significant traffic disruptions due to water bodies overflowing. To prepare for any contingencies, officials have been instructed to make relief materials readily available to citizens and to identify suitable rehabilitation centers. Immediate repair work on damaged state and national highways was also emphasized.

IMD forecast-Very heavy rainfall occurred at isolated places in Mulugu district, while heavy rainfall occurred at isolated places in Bhadradri-Kothagudem, Khammam, Karimnagar and other districts, the Indian Meteorological Centre said, in its bulletin.

The Nagpur variety of the citrus fruit is grown in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra and farmers there have reported a bumper crop

By Asif Yar Khan Published Date - 18 December 2023, 07:30 AM

Hyderabad: A bumper crop of the famed Nagpur oranges is flooding Hyderabad’s markets this season with the fruit being sold at a lower price compared to previous years.

This season, 491 trucks carrying the fruit from different districts of Maharashtra arrived at the Batasingaram market. A few dozen trucks also arrived at the Maozamjahi and Gudimalkapur markets.

The Nagpur variety of the citrus fruit is grown in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra and farmers there have reported a bumper crop. While 114 truckloads arrived here in December 2021, around 344 truckloads of the orange landed here the following year. However, this year so far, 491 trucks arrived at the Batasingaram market. “The average price per quintal is Rs 1,000. During the corresponding period last year, it was Rs 1,750,” said Batasingaram Fruit Market secretary Ch Narsimha Reddy.

The common man is benefiting to a large extent due to the low prices. A dozen of orange is sold for Rs 100. “It depends on the quality of the fruit. There are also oranges sold for Rs 700 a quintal,” the official said.

On average from November-end, 15 to 20 trucks of the fruit are supplied to the city daily. After the Nagpur variety supply ends, the fruit from Rajasthan starts arriving but the supply is very low. The orange season will continue till March or mid-April.

Due to huge supplies at the market, the fruit is reaching retailers in large quantities. “We are doing business at minimum profits to sell more quantity and earn money,” said Syed Shadab, a fruit trader at Afzalgunj.",flood,Nagpur orange flood,"Hyderabad, Telangana",November 2023,March 2024,"Batasingaram, Maozamjahi, Gudimalkapur",,,,Low prices for oranges,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

“As the rain became intense, resulting in overflowing of local streams, they were trapped in the forest itself. As night fell, the stranded tourists were panicky,” he said.

Fortunately, some of the tourists called emergency services and managed to get in touch with the office of the superintendent of police. “We immediately alerted the district disaster response force (DRF), the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and the local police,” the SP said.

Immediately, a team of 50 personnel from the DRF, NDRF, and the police braved the darkness and the rising waters to reach out to the stranded tourists. “After searching the area throughout the night, they were able to locate the tourists,” he said.

Experts are sounding alarm bells, warning that this relentless inundation not only poses a significant threat to the city’s infrastructure but also results in catastrophic consequences, including tragic loss of lives. As the metropolis struggles to cope with this ever-growing menace, urgent measures are imperative to safeguard the city and its residents from the devastating consequences of unmitigated floods.

Speaking toThe Hans India, NV Umamahesh, Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, National Institute of Technology (NIT) Warangal, says, “Based on data acquired from the India Meteorological Department, Hyderabad (IMD-H) spanning from 1971 to the present day, it becomes evident that the formidable challenges of climate change and urbanisation have emerged as significant catalysts for the increasingly perilous floods besieging the city. Under the ominous shadow of climate change, Hyderabad experiences extreme rainfall events whenever rainfall descends the city, adding to the escalating flood risks.”

While Hyderabad continues to receive normal or even above-average rainfall, a concerning trend has emerged over the years — the dwindling number of rainy days. Additionally, the intensity of rainfall, when it does occur, exhibits a stark irregularity, failing to distribute evenly across the city. Instead, it culminates in abrupt and heavy downpours within a remarkably short timeframe, disrupting the rhythm of daily life and throwing normalcy into disarray.

Adding further, NV Umamahesh says, “The exacerbation of this crisis can be squarely attributed to the encroachment upon water bodies and the neglect of essential drainage system maintenance. Moreover, a pivotal factor in this escalating calamity lies in the unparalleled urbanisation that has surged since the early 1990s. This explosive growth has ushered in significant alterations in air circulation patterns, thereby resulting in substantial changes in precipitation dynamics. Additionally, the urban heat island effect, induced by rapid urbanisation, has further disrupted the natural flow of winds, compounding the challenges posed by this evolving meteorological landscape.”

Another ongoing study under Professor Gopal Naik in the Civil Engineering Department of Osmania University says, “The civic agencies responsible for drain maintenance in the city have fallen short in their efforts to adequately desilt these vital conduits. The consequences of this negligence are stark: the carrying capacity of these drains has substantially diminished over time. Encroachments upon these waterways and the deposition of non-biodegradable waste, including plastics, wood and other refuse materials, have contributed to the problem. These pollutants accumulate within the drains, resulting in reduced drainage capacity and an exacerbated risk of flooding during heavy rainfall.”

A noticeable lack of coordination among various key departments, including GHMC, Irrigation, Revenue, Lakes, Roads and Buildings, has become a glaring issue. The unique terrain of the region necessitates a comprehensive, multi-directional drainage system. To achieve this, it’s imperative to implement a strategy of creating slopes every 10 kms to facilitate unobstructed water flow into the Musi river.

Of particular importance is the meticulous consideration of water management during the issuance of building permissions. A critical aspect of this process should involve a thorough evaluation of how rainfall runoff will be managed to prevent flooding and waterlogging, ensuring that new constructions do not exacerbate the city’s existing drainage challenges.

Adding further, Gopal Naik, says, “The current drainage infrastructure, which is two to three decades old, was originally designed to serve a population of 5 million. However, the city has experienced exponential population growth due to urbanisation, the expansion of impervious surfaces, the emergence of unauthorised colonies in catchment areas, and various other factors. In light of these evolving dynamics, it is imperative to plan for the future by implementing radial drainage systems capable of accommodating the anticipated growth in population and the escalating frequency of rainfall over the next 25 years. This forward-looking approach is essential to effectively manage the city’s drainage needs in the face of ongoing urban development and changing climate patterns.”",flood,Hyderabad Floods,"Hyderabad, Telangana",2022-07-07,2022-07-10,"['Hyderabad city', 'Secunderabad', 'Kukatpally', 'Gachibowli', 'L.B.

Shafiullah Rahimi, the ruling Taliban’s appointed spokesman for Afghanistan’s State Ministry for Natural Disaster Management, said Sunday that at least 31 people were killed, 74 were injured and 41 others were missing. Flash floods hit the capital, Kabul, the Maidan Wardak and Ghazni provinces. He added that the majority of the casualties were in west Kabul and Maidan Wardak.

Rahimi also said around 250 livestock perished in the floods.

The flooding brought further misery to the already suffering Afghanistan. In April, the U.N.’s humanitarian affairs agency said the south Asian country is facing its third consecutive year of drought, its second year of severe economic hardship and the consequences of decades of war and natural disasters.

The most recent flash flood happened in the Jalrez district of Maidan Wardak province west of Kabul, killing 12 people, said Taliban government spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid. At least 40 other people were missing and rescue teams were busy conducting search and rescue operations, he said.

The provincial governor’s office in a statement said that hundreds of homes were either damaged or destroyed and the missing are believed to be under the rubble of collapsed homes.

The statement also said that hundreds of square miles of agricultural land were washed out and destroyed and the highway between Kabul and the central Bamiyan province was closed due to the floods.

In Pakistan, 13 people died and seven were injured due to heavy rains and landslides as monsoon season continued to affect parts of the country Sunday.

In the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, nine people lost their lives over the last 48 hours in rain-related incidents.

In the Skardu area of the Gilgit Baltistan region, four family members died when a massive landslide hit their car, according to police officer Raja Mirza Hassan.

Taimur Khan, a spokesman of the provincial disaster management authority, said heavy rainfall and thunderstorms damaged at least 74 houses in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Chandrasekhar Rao took stock of the situation and directed Chief Secretary A. Santhi Kumari to ensure official machinery was geared up for any eventuality.

The Godavari kept swelling at Bhadrachalam with the water level in the river hovering over 44 feet and about 9.79 lakh cusecs of flood water flowing downstream on Thursday night. The water level in the river is expected to reach 46 feet, just short of the second flood warning level of 48 feet, in the wee hours of Friday, official sources said.

The bathing ghats along the river, abutting the karakatta (flood bank) remained submerged and the backwaters from the swollen river entered the low-lying areas in the temple town.

Residents of the Kotha Colony were shifted to a local relief camp after the floodwaters encircled their houses, sources added.

Following the forecast of heavy rains in the catchment areas of the Godavari for the next two days, the authorities operationalised flood control rooms in Bhadrachalam and Kothagudem and kept the NDRF teams ready for deployment.

District Collector Priyanka Ala on Thursday night visited the relief camps and also oversaw the operation of high-capacity motors to pump out stagnant water at Vista complex near the famous Sri Sitaramachandra Swamy temple in Bhadrachalam. Chief Minister directed Hyderabad District Collector Anudeep Durishetty, who was earlier Collector of the district, to rush to Bhadrachalam and help the administration in taking up relief measures.

In Mulugu district, as many as 59 spillway gates of the Sammakka Sagar (Tupakulagudem) barrage were kept open releasing 8.76 lakh cusecs of flood water downstream.

The vehicular movement on the National Highway 163 at Tekulagudem village in Wazedu mandal was affected after the swollen Godavari inundated a culvert on the vital road link between Telangana and Chhattisgarh on Thursday evening, sources added.

Due to heavy rains in Vikarabad and Shankarpally, inflows into the Osmansagar and Himayatsagar reservoirs surged from the previous day, putting the engineering officials from the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) on high alert.

Due to increasing inflows, 12 gates of the Osmansagar reservoir have been lifted by six feet height when last news came in, while for the Himayatsagar, six gates have been opened up to three feet height. The outflows from Osmansagar have increased from 1,278 cusecs at 8 a.m. to 7,308 cusecs at 8 p.m., while for Himayatsagar, they have risen from 330 cusecs to 5,780 cusecs during the same time.

An alert has been sounded by the Police in the slums, which have come up in the river bed of Musi, local residents informed.

“They said more water is being released from the twin lakes, and asked us to leave for safer places. Seven to eight families have vacated their homes and moved to higher reaches,” informed Syed Bilal, from Chaderghat. Announcements have been made in mosques where people have been urged to take shelter in case of emergency, he said.

Outflow from Hussain Sagar is recorded at 1,796 cusecs, with the water level at 513.48 metres against an FTL of 513.41 metres.

Disaster Response Force (DRF) teams of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) were working to drain water from inundated areas.

GHMC officials said heavy rainfall of over 9 cm was recorded in some parts of the city.

Advertisement Water was overflowing the Moosarambagh causeway across the Musi river. Vehicular traffic also came to a halt under the Malakpet bridge.

Musi is in spate as the twin reservoirs across the river continue to receive massive inflows from upstream. Flood water is being released from both Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar.

Hyderabad Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) releases 1,278 cusecs of water from Osman Sagar into Musi, which flows through the city. The inflows at the reservoir were 1,200 cusecs. The current water level in the pool was 1,787 feet against the Full Tank Level (FTL) of 1,790 feet.

Himayat Sagar was also receiving inflows of 325 cusecs. Authorities are releasing 330 cusecs of water into Musi. The water level in the reservoir on Tuesday morning was 1,760.70 feet against an FTL of 1763.50 feet.

With massive inflows of rainwater continuing, Hussain Sagar lake in the city's heart was packed to its brim. The water level in the lake was 513.45 meters against an FTL of 513.41 metres. The excess water is being let out through vents. People living in areas downstream have been alerted.

A sprawling photo studio for wedding shoots, educational institutions, upscale resorts, villas and farmhouses crowd the peripheries of the Osmansagar and Himayatsagar lakes on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The massive campuses have been set up despite a March 8, 1996 government order that prohibits construction or industrial activity within 10 kilometres of the century-old reservoirs.

That order was passed to keep the reservoirs pollution-free. Now Telangana has repealed the order, paving the way for concretisation of the catchment areas of the lakes.

The K Chaadrashekar Rao government issued two orders on April 12 and April 20, authorising construction around the reservoirs as long as theie water quality was not impacted. The orders also announced the formation of a committee under the state chief secretary to frame guidelines to protect and prevent pollution in the waterbodies, and submit the report at the earliest.

The orders now allow real estate companies and other businesses to carry out construction in 84 villages in the catchment areas of the reservoirs.

Building on a lie

The state government rationalises the decision by claiming that the reservoirs now provide only 1.25 per cent of Hyderabad’s drinking water, from 27.59 per cent in 1996.

Experts contest the claim, saying that the reservoirs were constructed to save Hyderabad from flooding. “In 1908, the city saw a devastating flood, caused by the Musi river,” said Hyderabad-based environmentalist K Purushotham Reddy. That is when the Nizam (ruler) of Hyderabad had requested Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, a celebrated civil engineer and the then diwan (administrator) of the erstwhile Mysore kingdom, to make a flood control plan.

Visvesvaraya suggested constructing two reservoirs upstream of Hyderabad, one on the Musi and the other on its tributary, Esa, to absorb and store excess water during floods, says Purushotham Reddy. “The Nizam later decided to use the reservoirs to provide drinking water to the city and prohibited polluting activity in the catchment area,” he added.

Till 1975, the reservoirs were used to meet the drinking water needs of Hyderabad. As the city expanded, it started receiving water from Krishna and Godavari rivers, from over 200 km away. Even today, the two reservoirs provide 226.5 billion litres of water a day to the city. “There is no logic in destroying existing facilities. It will affect the sustainability of the city,” Reddy said.

Rajkumar Singh, an environmental activist who filed a petition with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2015 to conserve the catchment areas of the two lakes, says the reservoirs have saved Hyderabad from at least six major flooding events between 1908 and early 2000s. “The concretisation started around the 2000s and the city witnessed floods in 2020 and 2021,” he added.

If the catchment area gets concretised further, the flood waters could move six times faster than normal and cause unprecedented damage, said BV Subbarao, hydrologist and technical advisor at Bangalore University, adding that the latest move is not in the interest of Telangana. The Musi river originates and ends in the state.

“Telangana has 100 per cent control over the river. It has a basin of 12,000 sq km and the catchment areas of the reservoirs account for almost 17 per cent of the river’s catchment area,” Subbarao said.

“Starting in April, wind starts to flow over the two reservoirs and it has a cooling effect on Hyderabad. Allowing construction activities in its catchment areas will mean summers will get hotter in the city,” Reddy said.

Without a thought

Telangana Chief Minister Rao said the decision would provide employment and livelihood, but the residents are sceptical. But farmers for whom agriculture is not sustainable and residents who want to sell their land but are getting low rates are in favour of this.

The real estate sharks purchased lots of land in the catchment directly. The poor sold the land at low rates as registration was not happening,” said N Saibhaskar Reddy, environmentalist and resident of Gondala village, which is in the catchment area.

Purushotam Reddy said real estate companies have already purchased sizeable chunks of land in the catchment area over the past decade or so. They now want to carry out construction work legally.

This is not the first time the state government has tried to repeal the 1996 order.

The first attempt was made in 2014, as soon as Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh. That year, there were also efforts to set up a polluting industry along the lake. The move was stalled after Singh moved NGT, which asked the chief secretary to submit a report on the number of encroachments in the 84 villages.

A government report issued at the time said there were 12,500 illegal structures in the catchment villages. Singh says the actual number is over 20,000. “The area also has government buildings that are illegal,” he said.

In 2016, the state government constituted an expert committee to study the merits of the order. Singh alleges the committee was supposed to submit its report in 45 days, but never released its findings.

But she insists that they are no encroachers.

On a rainy evening last week, an announcement from a nearby mosque was enough for the residents of Shankernagar Basti in Hyderabad’s Old Malakpet to leave everything behind and move to safer places. “In the last three years,” said Begum, “we have been hurriedly shifted out four times to take shelter in mosques, schools, and community halls.” As the water levels rose last week, the government evacuated over 1,500 people from these slums on the riverbed.

Rising water levels in the Musi, which was deemed a dead river for the last few decades, are the result of flood waters being released from Hyderabad’s two Nizam-era reservoirs, Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar. At the peak of rains in Vikarabad and Rangareddy districts, from where water flows into the reservoirs, over 20,000 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of water was released downstream. Submergence of about 160 colonies along the river bank, including the colony where Razia Begum lives, was a given at that point, as per officials with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC).

These men and women – drivers, hawkers, vendors, house helps, construction labourers and so on who have been living in cramped houses on the riverbed – form the backbone of the city. “Facing Musi’s fury, then evacuating and starting again from scratch is a vicious cycle now,” added Begum. The worst part: it is in October and November that the southwest monsoon peaks in Hyderabad.

Former deputy director general of India Meteorological Department (IMD) and currently a consultant with the state’s weather monitoring agency Telangana State Development Planning Society, Dr Y V Rama Rao, said Telangana is likely to receive 50 to 60 per cent excess rainfall this season, like the previous two years. “Usually, it is the northern and eastern districts that receive maximum rainfall in July. This year, it rained non-stop in July. August, too, is expected to see good rainfall. And central Telangana, including Hyderabad, receives its maximum rainfall in September and October during the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon. So we can expect a lot of rain,” he said.

‘Consider not just the rains, but Musi river’

However, when it comes to the river Musi, it is not the rains but the river that is to be considered, said Varghese Theckanath, director of Montfort Social Institute (MSI) and the founder-convenor of Campaign for Housing and Tenurial Rights (CHATRI). “It is only in the last three to five years that we are witnessing consistent urban flooding in Hyderabad. Flooding of Musi in July itself and not in September or October is reason enough to examine what is wrong with the twin reservoirs,” said Theckanath, who has been fighting for the rights of the slum dwellers along the river for the last three decades.

The two reservoirs were commissioned in the 1920s by the then Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan as flood mitigation structures that doubled up as sources of drinking water for the city after the 1908 Musi floods.

Pointing to the narrow lanes where women were busy removing muck from their homes after flood waters receded, Abdul Jabbar Khan, a carpenter, said all the nearly 200 families whose lives were in danger were willing to be relocated. Mohammed Altaf Qureshi, a young butcher from the locality, added, “Give us government housing within a 2-3 km radius. Or at least compensate us aptly according to the going market rates and we will go.” According to him, the residents of the slum have ownership documents and pay corporation taxes and electricity bills.

Recalling his visit to Shankernagar Basti in the late 1990s, S Jeevan Kumar of Human Rights Forum, said the 200-odd families in question had built their homes in the river’s buffer zone after 2004. “These areas were demarcated as danger zones but people went on buying these lands from families who had rights for cultivation on the river bed from the Nizam’s era. These slum-dwellers have semi-legal documents and homes were built with the complete knowledge of civic authorities and the government,” he said. Kumar, who has been working for the housing and tenurial rights of people living here, echoed the views of Theckanath as he said the problem is not the rain but the river.

Activists have been crying foul, stressing that when the changing weather and rainfall patterns are bound to cause massive downpours, one needs to look at the ground for solutions. “The city’s topography and contours are such that water from anywhere in the city will naturally flow into Musi. In the name of the city’s development and beautification of the river and its channels, a lot of damage has already been done to the river. As of a 2017 government report, there are over 5,400 encroachments on the river,” Kumar lamented.

At Musa Nagar, another slum by the riverside near Chaderghat, residents have been demanding a retaining wall to prevent annual flooding. Around 100 of the 140 homes here were flooded last week. Musa Nagar, unlike Shankernagar, is a notified slum and is over eight decades old. “We face flooding every time water is released from Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar. A strong wall is all that is required to save us from this misery,” said Kausar Sultana, a senior citizen and resident.

‘Bring back GO-111’

After the cancellation of government order (GO) 111 earlier this year, activists have been demanding a rollback to prevent the uncontrolled urbanisation of 84 villages in the catchment area of the two reservoirs that are now open to real estate. The government order of 1996 restricted any major constructions within a 10-km radius of the full-tank level of the two reservoirs to prevent pollution. “The removal of GO-111 is a bigger concern. The government needs to look at desilting the river as well as the two reservoirs to restore its water-holding capacity. The city is connected to the river through its canals. A deluge like the one in 1908 can happen every year,” said Jeevan Kumar.

The GHMC, however, believes that its Strategic Nala Development Plan (SNDP) would prevent future urban flooding in Hyderabad. Mayor Gadwal Vijayalaxmi, while speaking to indianexpress.com last month, had said that 90 per cent of the major works taken up under SNDP were complete and the corporation was well prepared for the monsoons taking lessons from the deluge of October 2020. She had stressed that the GHMC was working on acquiring properties that are encroachments inside and along the city’s nalas and convincing them to move to government housing.

At the Musanagar Basti (Express/Rahul V Pisharody) At the Musanagar Basti (Express/Rahul V Pisharody)

According to RTI activist S Q Masood, there is no strategy in SNDP. In an RTI response he received from GHMC in June, the corporation said it had no information available on SNDP other than works being undertaken and funds spent. Masood had sought information on agencies or consultants involved or hired, consultations or meetings held with different agencies and public representatives before finalisation of the SNDP; details of survey and field inspections of areas that suffered during the October 2020 floods in Hyderabad; and details of areas demarcated as low-lying or highly prone to floods after the October 2020 floods.

“After the October 2020 floods, the GHMC has not conducted any study to demarcate low-lying and flood-prone areas. There is no strategy to prevent future flooding other than routine activities of building retaining walls and laying unscientific box-type drainage lines,” said Masood, adding that the government should be better prepared in preventing floods and responding to a crisis. “GO-111 should be restored and all encroachments inside the two reservoirs should be removed. Authorities should consider the maximum water spread area instead of the present full-tank level for releasing water into Musi,” he added.

As authorities are drawing up new plans to rejuvenate the riverfront by building new roads, bridges, open gyms, and walking and cycling tracks, Theckanath reiterated the need to restore GO-111. “There is a need to protect the river and to protect the people. We need to accommodate people within a 2-3 km radius by integrating people and their livelihoods into the development plan.”",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The first day of monsoon in the state also saw the first instance of waterlogging throwing life out of gear in congested low-lying locales of the Old City while the rest of the city experienced merely a pleasant drizzle, throwing light on the misplaced priorities in urban development during times of changing rainfall patterns.

Pockets of Chandrayangutta, Falaknuma and Rajendranagar circles of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), where the highest rainfall of just 5 cm was recorded in Bandlaguda, were worst affected and exposed the under-preparedness of the municipal authorities.

Dr K Nagarathna, director of IMD-Hyderabad, said that rains would continue to lash the state in the coming days as the monsoon had set in. “We can expect some good rains gradually but only normal to below normal rainfall in many districts. There will be heavy rainfall here and there. We have predicted an excess rainfall of 106 per cent for the southwest monsoon season,” she said.

Following the deluge of October 2020, which saw overnight rainfall of up to 36 cm at certain pockets, the state government and the GHMC have been relentlessly endorsing their Rs 954 crore-worth Strategic Nala Development Programme (SNDP), as the mechanism to mitigate future floods in the city. Nearly two years later, the corporation says that 50 to 60 per cent of each of its 37 works is complete.

Under the SNDP, the GHMC is implementing 37 works at Rs 757 crore whereas another 23 works are taken up by adjoining 9 municipalities at Rs 197 crore. According to the corporation, it has studied the city’s existing storm-water drainage network to identify narrow points, encroachments of channels, etc. The works under progress include widening existing nalas, desilting, restoration of lakes, construction of new bridges and sluice gates, and allowing for diversion of run-off from waterbodies to nearby colonies.

As images of inundated low-lying areas and river-like water flow on streets emerged on Wednesday morning, the GHMC is facing criticism for their failure to complete the flagship project before the monsoon. Municipal Administration Minister KT Rama Rao, while speaking at the launch of the department’s annual report recently, asked the media to be kind in their reporting as he believed some areas of the city would witness flooding this year too as works were in progress. All cities are bound to face inconveniences due to flooding, he had said, while assuring the audience that the government is working on this.

Prepared, ready to do anything to prevent loss of lives: Mayor

GHMC mayor Gadwal Vijayalaxmi told indianexpress.com on Wednesday that the corporation would do everything on its part to prevent any loss of life. “It is not true to say there has been a delay in implementation of works. Of all the major works, 90 per cent are complete. The rest will be done by the second week of July. With the experience of 2020, we are well prepared for the monsoons this year. Our emergency teams are on the ground. We are coordinating well with other wings and departments. I am going to review the progress every week,” the mayor said, adding, “the city is growing and then there will be problems but the corporation is confident of handling these situations.”

As part of a pre-monsoon safety audit, an official on the condition of anonymity said, the civic body has identified 300 vulnerable points adjoining different nalas and covered these locations with safety meshes and installed signboards. GHMC engineering wing’s 168 mobile and mini-mobile monsoon action teams, and 19 teams of GHMC’s disaster management wing will work with the electricity, water and police departments, he said. Control rooms are set up in the headquarters as well as zonal offices.

The mayor did admit that there has been a delay in certain aspects. “It is regarding the acquisition of properties that people have encroached upon inside and along the nalas. We are trying to convince them to relocate by offering two-bedroom government housing. That work is progressing. Otherwise, desilting of nalas is a round-the-year activity. We focussed on places such as LB Nagar, Uppal etc that suffered flooding last time. About 70 per cent of the construction of retaining walls along the nalas are complete,” she explained.

SNDP a cash cow, disaster inevitable, say activists

Environmental activists and experts feel the city is waiting for an inevitable disaster. Stressing that the city is not ready for rain, climate change expert Dr BV Subba Rao asked the government to make the approach, contents, strategy and plans behind SNDP public. “Hyderabad is a city of lakes. These lakes are clustered in groups. Our entire urban hydrology must be based on the hydrology of the networking of the lakes rather than what we are talking about nalas,” Rao, a technical member (reservoirs, lakes and water domain) with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), said. “The lakes, which are flood-regulating structures, are under the irrigation department, and irrigation engineers are not trained on urban hydrology and urban flooding. Violating the regulations in the catchments is the root cause of urban flooding and inundation of low-lying areas.”

As many as 14 cases filed by lake activist Dr Lubna Sarwath, the state president of water resources council of the Womens’ Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, against the encroachment of waterbodies have been in various stages of trial before different courts since 2015. A case against the encroachment of the Hussainsagar, Mamasanikunta, Narsingi and Bum-Rukn-ud-dowla lakes is before the National Green Tribunal in Chennai, whereas a case against the construction of a road inside the Nacharam lake is before the State Human Rights Commission.

A case she filed against the encroachment of Surramcheruvu in Bandlaguda is currently before the Lokayukta. Over the past seven years, she has filed cases in the Telangana High Court against the encroachment of the Hussainsagar lake, Khajaguda Talab, Malkamcheruvu, Devunikunta near Asif Nagar, Pallecheruvu near Mailardevpally, Nayaquila Talab, Shahahtam Talab, Jamalikunta Talab, Brahmankunta lake in Puppalaguda, and against specific encroachments of river Musi. Dr Sarwath said, “I am on record to say if our city is drowning, our judiciary is culpable. I mean every word of it. Given the number of cases we are fighting at various judicial platforms, the judiciary is condoning encroachments. This is my point,” she added.

Even as voices against the state’s move to repeal GO-111 grew stronger recently, with activists seeking protection of the Nizam-era reservoirs Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar, minister Rama Rao said his government intended to protect all the 3,000 lakes in Hyderabad and not just the two. However, activists have been apprehensive about the government’s idea of protecting the lakes by constructing roads, gardens and amenities inside the lake’s full tank level in the name of its beautification. “All lakes are either fully or partially encroached on by the government itself or by the private sector with the support of the government,” said Dr Sarwath.

A strong critic of SNDP, Dr Sarwath said that all that the government was required to do was free up the nalas that connect one lake to the other to ensure the free flow of water. “SNDP is a cash cow. There is no need to build concrete walls along the nalas. Now the wall on either side will prevent rainwater from entering these nalas that are erected either on the bund, edge or even inside the channels. SNDP is anything but about the naturalisation of the streams and channels connecting the lakes,” she said.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Telangana capital Hyderabad – like the rest of the country – has been witnessing heavy rain for the past few days, which has disrupted normal life. The weather department had earlier issued a yellow alert – warning of moderate rainfall and thunderstorms in the city over the following three days.

Rain has wreaked havoc in other parts of the country, including Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and the northeastern states of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

The national capital witnessed relentless rain which had brought the mercury down and given people the first taste of winter. On Wednesday, the city woke up to a thick layer of mist shrouding the city, which the India Meteorological Department said was a result of a prolonged spell of rain.

Heavy rain in parts of Uttar Pradesh claimed as many as nine lives and forced schools shut in a dozen districts, including Lucknow, Aligarh, Meerut, Gautam Buddh Nagar, and Ghaziabad.

Incessant rain in parts of Assam and neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh over the past few days resulted in a fresh wave of floods, state officials said Wednesday. According to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority, the fresh wave of floods affected 69,750 persons across 110 villages in five districts.

According to the Met department, conditions are likely to become favourable for the withdrawal of southwest monsoon from some more parts of northwest and central India during the next four days.

Md Salem, who was stuck for more than two hours at Jubilee Hills on his way to Shaikpet, said, “I was expecting that the rains would stop in 30 minutes or so, but it continued. The situation was more terrible when I reached Shaikpet as I had to push my bike as the water level was too high to ride.”

A residential apartment in Manikonda saw its cellar inundated and 25 cars getting submerged on Sunday. It took them an entire day to pump the water out.

A commuter in Nanakramguda, K. Sudhir, shared his plight as he drove his car on the water-logged road in Nanakramguda Saturday evening. Sudhir said, “It was another horrible experience. I was afraid to drive on the flooded road. I could not even imagine the risk that the two-wheeler motorists are exposed to in such situations”.

Md Roshan, who was traveling home from Filmnagar to Tolichowki and found himself in a pool of drainage water, said “ Such incidents expose the bad administration. No one cares about the taxpayers’ lives, neither the politicians, nor the civic bodies.”

Monday, June 11: Relentless rain over Telangana has put met departments in a frenzy, hurling one alert after the other at the state the whole of last week. With rain-induced waterlogging and city-wide disruptions prevalent all over Hyderabad and several other districts, respite cannot come sooner. However, residents will likely have to endure these conditions for a bit longer, as forecasts show that inclement conditions will persist for the week in the southern state.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana are likely to be lashed by localised extremely heavy rains till Tuesday (July 12), while heavy rainfall will drench the remaining regions for the next 4-5 days. The rest of the state will be engulfed by widespread rains that will continue to bring moisture over the region till Friday (July 15).

These conditions have prompted the IMD to put Telangana on a red warning (meaning ‘take action’) till Tuesday, with conditions likely to improve thereafter. However, Hyderabad only remains on a yellow watch (meaning ‘be updated’) till Wednesday (July 13).

Many of these districts have already felt the brunt of the heavy rains, with waterlogging and flash floods becoming a fairly common occurrence over the past 2-3 days. And despite the absence of any significant alerts over Hyderabad, the city witnessed flooding of several roads that led to widespread traffic disruptions as well.

These impacts prompted the Hyderabad city police to put out advisories asking citizens to avoid non-essential travel. These advisories are likely to stay in place while the red warning hangs over the state, that is, till Tuesday.

The incessant weekend rains even flooded several reservoirs in the city, leading to the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board having to lift floodgates to release excess water from the Osamansagar and Himayatsagar reservoirs. More might be opened in the coming days depending on need, officials added.

Advertisement Further, reports add that over 30 suburban MMTS train services have been cancelled till Wednesday. Heavy rains added to that flooding concerns in the Kumuram Bheem Asifabad, Nirmal, Nizamabad, Peddapalli, Rajanna Sircilla, Jayashankar Bhupalpally and Mulugu districts.

IMD issues alerts over multiple Telangana districts

While Hyderabad isn’t under any significant alerts as of now, many other districts have been placed under the following alerts:

Monday, July 11: Mahabubabad, Jangaon, Suryapet, Bhuvanagiri and Nalgonda are on red warning , while most of the state remains on an orange alert (meaning ‘be prepared’).

, while most of the state remains on an (meaning ‘be prepared’). Tuesday, July 12: Sangareddy and Siddipet are on red warning with most parts under orange alert.

. Thursday, July 14: Nirmal and Sangareddy on orange alert.

According to the IMD, several factors have, and will continue to, contribute to these rainy conditions over Telangana — such as the low-pressure area that resides precariously close to Andhra Pradesh’s coast as well as the active state of the southwest monsoon trough.

As a result of these meteorological systems, Kaleswaram from Bhupalpally district (192 mm) received the highest amount of rain in the last 24 hours till 8:30 am on Monday, followed by Venkatapuram (178), Kotapalle (148 mm) and Bejjur (133 mm). Golkonda in Hyderabad received 23 mm of rain on the same day.

Meanwhile, since the beginning of the monsoon period on June 1, Telangana has accumulated a massive 95% excess in rainfall, having received 391 mm of rain against its normal of 200 mm. The month of July was especially bountiful for the state, with it having accumulated 248 mm precipitation in only the first ten days this month!

Hyderabad: The Central government while showering boons to other States and providing support in times of distress remains oblivious to the woes of the people of Telangana even when they are faced with hard times. This prejudiced approach on part of the NDA government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was very obvious when unprecedented heavy downpours lashed and flooded Hyderabad leaving people in dire need of help and assistance in the year 2020.

The Centre, which opened its coffers and extended help to 21 States by providing around Rs 40,000 crores under National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) from 2018-19 to 2021-22, maintained its apathetic approach towards Telangana.

Not a paisa was provided to the State even when heavy rains flooded the city and people faced severe hardships for days. In what turned out to be the second-highest rainfall to lash in the last 100 years, Hyderabad witnessed a record downpour of 32 cm that left lakhs of people in uncertain times in October 2020.

This is despite the Chief Minister, K Chandrashekhar Rao writing to the Prime Minister and requesting an immediate help of Rs 1,350 crore and Rs 5,000 crore from NDRF. This was followed by the MA&UD Minister, KT Rama Rao also appealing to the Centre and reminding about the Chief Minister’s letter.

Yet, the Modi government was neither moved by the plight of the citizens nor chose to extend a helping hand during the time of distress. Even a five-member central team’s visit to Hyderabad in the aftermath of the nightmarish flooding went futile. Ironically, union Minister G Kishan Reddy, who never misses an opportunity in making tall claims, failed to follow up and get the required assistance to Hyderabad from the union government.

It is common for any State to seek help from the union government in times of disasters and the Centre is duty-bound to reach out and support them. While the present dispensation in the Centre has been extremely benevolent in helping some States, the same sorely is missed out when it comes to the people of Telangana.

However, not deterred by the NDA government’s discrimination towards Telangana, the State government led by Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao come out in complete support of people affected by the flooding. In a humanitarian gesture, the Chief Minister not only ensured that rice and essentials were provided to families affected by the flooding but also provided Rs 10,000 in cash.

Says Manne Krishank, Chairman of Telangana State Mineral Development Corporation, “though the entire nation saw how Hyderabad was affected by the heavy rains and flooding, the BJP government at Centre pretended not to notice it. The kind of support that the Centre extends to other States is never given to Telangana.”

An 1872 aqueduct that connected a series of irrigation tanks to the south of Hyderabad and kept the city safe from flooding is now just a dotted line on old Survey Of India maps. The aqueduct connected lakes and artificial tanks between Chandanvalli and Ibrahimpatnam paralleling the River Musi that flows through the city.

“The aqueduct served as a flood-control measure as well as an irrigation channel. But as property prices have risen, the disused portions of the channel have been encroached. The inundation of colonies around Shukoor Sagar lake is because of these encroachments,” says K. Purshottam Reddy, who was on the board of Environment Protection Training Research Institute.

Aqueducts are called Firangi/Phirangi due to their novelty in Indian irrigation systems. During the flood of October 2020, it was the southern part of Hyderabad that was ravaged as overflowing water from Jalpally Lake, Surram Cheruvu, Palle Cheruvu, Umda Sagar and Gurram Cheruvu raced towards the River Musi.

It didn’t help matters that these lakes have also shrunk due to residential colonies being developed by political strongmen. “If the aqueduct was in use, the flooding would not have been so devastating,” says Mr. Reddy. South Hyderabad bore the brunt of flooding in 2020 and 2021.

While the aqueduct has disappeared on the ground it still marks the boundaries of four out of 28 wards of Jalpally Municipality notified in 2019.

The aqueduct’s importance as a flood-control method declined when a series of lakes and tanks including the Chandanvelli broke their banks on September 27-28, 1908, flooding the Musi River and killing 15,000 residents in Hyderabad.

Irrigation Minister Harish Rao blamed urbanisation projects like the 150-km Outer Ring Road and National Highways for disrupting the remnants of the aqueducts, rendering it useless.

“I tried to trace it but only small portions of the original aqueduct remain near Umda Sagar lake and near Shamshabad. The water flow is disturbed and it is stagnant,” says Sibghat Khan, an architect who traced the water channel on a map.

A similar effort to trace the aqueduct was not successful at Osman Nagar. “People of the locality blamed the destruction of the aqueduct for inundation of their colony. The farmers in the area remembered the channel but they were helpless as large portions of it had already disappeared,” says Anant Maringanti of Hyderabad Urban Labs.",flood,Hyderabad flood of 2020,"Hyderabad, Telangana, India","October 17, 2020","October 20, 2020",South Hyderabad,100 mm,Rs. 100 crore,10,Thousands of people were displaced from their homes.,"The flood was caused by the overflow of Jalpally Lake, Surram Cheruvu, Palle Cheruvu, Umda Sagar and Gurram Cheruvu.

Back in October 2020, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) issued directives to the state government-appointed committee to evict encroachers from lakes in Tellapur and create buffer zones. “It has been two years since the order was passed. There hasn’t been a single initiative in that direction to save the lakes in Tellapur,” Ramana told STOI.Almost 90% of the Chelika Cheruvu is found to have been shrunk while the remaining two are laden with high-rise gated communities. The stormwater drain work launched at 7.6 km-long Radial Road 30 Extension (RR30EXT) earlier this year has barely been laid on a 1 km stretch near Goppanapalli side. The RR30EXT starts from Goppanapalli and ends at Outer Ring Road connecting 34 gated communities.Recalling the 2020 floods in Tellapur, Srinivas Rao , another member of TeNA, said that two gated communities - Indus Crust and NCC Cyber Urbania, saw their entire parking lots flooded causing major property damage.Official sources from Tellapur municipality note that there are portions of the RR30EXT towards ORR that are yet to be laid by the roads and buildings department and cites that the delay in road works is causing delays in laying the stormwater drains. “Also, identifying the outlet locations at lakes stands as another issue as there are difficulties in clearing some of the encroachments,” an official said.

Hyderabad: Following the heavy downpour on Wednesday morning, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) pressed into service its staff and Disaster Response Force (DRF) teams in the early hours.

The teams equipped with machinery cleaned catch pits, removed silt from nalas, cleared garbage choking the nalas and took up works to drain out water from low lying areas that were affected due to rains. In addition to this, removing uprooted trees, clearing fallen tree branches, tangled wires and other works to restore normalcy were taken up.

By afternoon, the teams were able to clear water from many low lying areas following which, the sanitation staff started removing the silt and garbage accumulated due to inundation. The entomology wing also joined in to taken up measures to control the mosquito population.

Gokul Nagar in Tarnaka, Lower Tank Bund, West Marredpally, Amberpet, Gandhi Nagar in Chikadpally, RTC Kalyana Mandapam road, Shastripuram, Vijaynagar Colony and Balaji Nagar in Mehdipatnam were among the localities where the civic body cleared the water stagnation by afternoon.

Senior officials, including zonal commissioners, monitored the situation and personally inspected the works to clear the rain related works. Different wings of the civic body including maintenance, sanitation, entomology etc worked in coordination to restore normalcy in rain-affected areas.

A statement from the Chief Minister’s Office said Wednesday that the state government has submitted a report to the Centre of the preliminary estimations of flood losses in the natural calamity.

Incessant rains across the state’s northern and eastern districts had inundated and cut-off villages in low-lying areas disrupting power, water and supply of essentials and leading to widespread flooding. Farmers across the state are worried about their crops as their fields were flooded at the beginning of the season itself.

Meanwhile, a team of experts designated to assess the flood-related damages in the state and submit a report to the Centre is expected to arrive in Hyderabad Thursday.

During the week, nearly 30,000 people were relocated to rescue camps. At least 15 lives were lost and the Bhadradri Kothagudem district, where flood waters in the River Godavari touched 71 feet against a third level warning of 53 feet, was the worst affected. Adilabad, Jayashankar Bhupalapally, Komaram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial, Mulugu, Nirmal, and Peddapalli were also battered by heavy rain.

Giving detail, the state government said the Roads and Buildings Department has incurred a loss of Rs 498 crore towards roads and causeways that were washed away. Panchayat Raj Department suffered a loss of Rs 449 crore, followed by the Municipal Administration Department which pegged its losses at Rs 379 crore. Similarly, the Irrigation Department has prepared losses to the tune of Rs 33 crore, whereas Energy Department pitched a figure of Rs 7 crore.

The preliminary estimation of losses incurred by these departments was compiled and presented to the Centre. The state government said it has also estimated a loss of Rs 25 crore to submergence of villages, incidents of house collapse and evacuation and relocation of the victims.

But in recent years, heavy rainfall has been occurring at any time in the southwest monsoon season from June to September.

There is a need for the meteorological department to improve forecasts by dividing the city into sub divisions and efficiently used the Doppler weather radar.

Hyderabad metro city urgently requires a disaster mitigation plan keeping in mind the ambitious initiatives of the Telangana government to turn it into a global destination for investments and a livable and safe city.

In the 2022 monsoon season, July turned out to be the wettest month in the city of Hyderabad. The city, the joint capital of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states recorded excess rainfall of 144.2 mm against the average of 38.1 mm.

The rainfall was particularly heavy during the week of July 6-13, with torrential rains lashing almost the entire Hyderabad and its outskirts. From June 1, starting with the pre-monsoon showers the city received a high of 511 mm rainfall upto August 1, which is 218 mm higher than the average for the entire monsoon season, according to data from the Telangana State Development Planning Society.

The volume of rainfall on July 26, ranged between 6 cms and 10 cms in just two hours around midnight. It left people in several areas struggling with water logging, inundation, overflowing drains. Fluctuating power and outages further aggravated the situation. Homes were flooded with rainwater and sewerage mixed and thousands of people in areas such as Padma Colony of Chaderghat, Ayyappa Colony in Nagole, Kodandaram Nagar and Saraswathi Nagar in Saroornagar, and certain locations of Malakpet, LB Nagar and Dilsukhnagar, were affected.

Usually, September was the month when the city received heavy rainfall. But in recent years, heavy rainfall has been occurring at any time in the southwest monsoon season from June to September. Among the worst extreme weather events in the city in recent years was the record-breaking rainfall (192 mm during October 13-14) and consequent floods in October 2020, which left nearly 50 dead and destruction estimated around Rs. 5000 crores (Rs. 50 billion).

Hyderabad and neighbouring areas have reported extreme rainfall spells of between 15 and 24 cms in a single day on four occasions in the last decade – July 2012, September 2016, September 2019 and October 2020. Before that, the heaviest downpour was 24 cms in 24 hours in August 2000. With this increasing frequency of episodes of extreme rainfall, the river Musi, considered nearly dead has come alive and started to overflow at some point and submerging low lying areas.

While extreme weather changes continue on one hand, on the other, Hyderabad city continues to grow rapidly. Specially over the last two decades, with high rise corporate and residential buildings, flyovers, the metro rail and upcoming ring roads bring with them, arise in traffic, population and waste generation.

Cyberabad, the area of Hyderabad which hosts major global technology companies, has has large residential complexes but not a well-planned drainage system, according to experts.

This urbanisation and transformation, though impressive in external appearance has neither been very planned nor with a definite vision. Consequently, Hyderabad is fast losing its natural courses of rainwater drainage system that were the cornerstone of a visionary plan by engineer Mokshagundem Vishveswarayya in the early 20th century. Moved by the large scale destruction and death of thousands in the September 1908 Musi river floods, the Nizam Osman Ali Khan had specially sought and got the engineer to formulate a long term plan. As per the plan, two large reservoirs, Osmansagar and Himayathsagar were created in 1911. A network of storm water drains (nalas) were connected and the dozens of lakes supplemented in ensuring that the rainwater did not flood any areas of human habitation but ran their course into the river.

Climate change impact

The impact of climate change is manifesting in the form of an increase in the episodes, and in some cases intensity, of extreme weather incidents, especially heavy rainfall in cities across India. “Both the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea which influence cyclonic and other atmospheric events have witnessed a rise in warming over the decades. This in turn is triggering cyclones, floods and heavy rainfall across the central and south India covering over 50,000 sq kms,” says Raghu Murtugudde, a visiting professor at the IIT, Mumbai and Emeritus Professor at the University of Maryland in the United States.

“The erratic distribution of rainfall during the southwest (SW) monsoon period is also due to global warming. Instances of heavy downpour of over 150 mm per day are typically characterised as ‘extreme rainfall events’, he explained.

“The SW monsoon is also pronouncedly effected by El Niño or La Niña factors. This year the latter has been strong from May and the rainfall fluctuations can be attributed to it,” says K. Ashok, a professor at the Centre for Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Studies at the University of Hyderabad.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), 2022 has seen the second highest occurrence of extreme weather events in the last 100 years. In March, the country experienced the highest temperatures in some parts of north India.

While in cities, these weather events take a toll on urban infrastructure, business and everyday life, in rural areas the changes in the rainfall patterns could have a long term impact on the farming operations during the kharif season, especially in those areas dependent on monsoon rains only.

Forecasts and preparedness

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been improving its forecasts of weather and rainfall over the years. It has set up Doppler Radars that give precise data for forecasts. These radars send electromagnetic waves to the rainbearing clouds and the sensors record the intensity of the rain bands. The data is then analysed to provide forecast of rainfall.

In Hyderabad however, the only Doppler Radar located at the old Begumpet airport, was not functional for over a month during the June-July period.

In the absence of the radar, the weather department used other forecasting tools such as light observation, synoptic charts, models and radars from other places, said K. Nagaratna, Director of IMD, Hyderabad.

“It’s a tedious process, looking at all these radars, but we’re making sure the forecasts are correct. If our (Doppler) radar is operational, it will be simple for us to provide forecasts,” she told the media.

While the IMD is well-equipped to make timely and accurate forecasts of urban rains, it has not divided the urban areas into met sub-divisions as suggested in the guidelines of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), says Marri Shashidhar Reddy, a former MLA of the Secunderabad locality of Hyderabad.

“We suggested watersheds or nalas as sub-divisions. In the case of Hyderabad, we will then have 13. The Doppler Radar can easily give precise rainfall date at these points, which in turn will help the disaster management and local body to swing into action,” Reddy, who was also the former Vice-Chairman of the NDMA explained.

Lessons from 2020

The extreme rainfall event of October 2020 comprehensively exposed the unpreparedness of Hyderabad in handling heavy rains.

With a network of 165 lakes and 13 storm water drains, as well as the Himayatsagar and Osmansagar reservoirs, Hyderabad has a natural solution to absorb large quantities of rainfall and prevent flooding.

However, construction of structures on the nalas, mix up of sewage lines, insufficient desilting before the monsoon and concretisation that stops the water from draining are all making the city more vulnerable to flooding.

In the name of beautification of the city, the basic conservation mechanisms are being sacrificed, which will have a bad effect in the long term, warned D. Narasimha Reddy, a noted environment and development activist. In fact, the lakes, which were a blessing were turned into a curse due to bad management and unplanned growth and expansion of the city. Instead of controlling floods, they are causing floods in low lying areas as their course has been obstructed by concretisation and spread shrunk by land grabbing, he alleged.

“We are still reacting to disasters in a knee jerk manner. Rescue, Relief and Rehabilitation (3 Rs) is the mantra. Never heard of a disaster management authority, discussion or meetings on tackling disasters in Telangana government’s Municipal Administration Department,” laments former MLA Shashidhar Reddy.

The 3 city departments — Urban Development, Metro Water Works and the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation have not been adequately strengthened with capacity to take preventive measures like timely forecasts, evacuation and desilting. Therefore, only once the disaster kicks in, do they jump into action., says Shashidhar Reddy.

Possible solutions and way forward

Most experts warn that unless a long term disaster mitigation plan is put in place and timely, preventive measures are taken, Hyderabad’s growth and image as a good destination for investments and living will be in jeopardy. It will be forced to resort to very expensive solutions like creating underground storage spaces or reservoirs (difficult given the rocky terrain).

However, a set of urgent steps that experts have suggested, to remedy the situation, are prevention of further encroachment of water bodies; better planning of drainage system in the concrete zone of Cyberabad, which is fast expanding; rehabilitation of people living in low lying and catchment areas of lakes and nalas and improving the forecast and alert system of the IMD tailored to cities.

A round table conference organised by Justice Subhashan Reddy Memorial Foundation towards July end on ‘Mitigation of urban floods and the way forward’ came up with a set of recommendations.

Locals said that parts of the lake turned black due to the garbage mixing with the water and the fish had started dying 4-5 days back.



What is making matters worse is that the dead fish are still lying around raising a strong stench and adding to the smell of water from the dumping yard.

71,2220,hyderabad,2022,https://www.siasat.com/hyderabad-why-the-hussain-sagar-has-never-flooded-our-city-2368529/,15 Jul 2022,Hyderabad: Why the Hussain Sagar has never flooded our city,"Hyderabad: Three days ago on July 12, alarm bells rang when the water levels of the Hussain Sagar touched 513.44 metres (above seal level) due to continuous and heavy rains. It was marginally over its full tank level (FTL) 513.41 metres. Residents living in its downstream areas like Domalguda and Ashok Nagar would have been affected had the rainfall continued the same way.

However, thanks to a slightly raised bund and fool-proof ancient overflow channels, the Hussain Sagar has never really flooded the city in spite of heavy rains. Any other lake would usually endanger its surrounding areas; a common issue during monsoons in Hyderabad and the state.

“There are proper escapes and overflow methods. One goes from Viceroy Hotel and the other goes from under the GHMC office. It goes via Amberpet and then joins the Musi River. People used to do gardening with paid water supply from the Hussain Sagar even until the 1970s,” said noted heritage activist Sajjad Shahid.

Excess water from the Hussain Sagar flows via different canals in different parts of Hyderabad to finally join the Musi river (the city was built on the river’s southern bank in 1591).

With Hyderabad receiving rains for nearly a week until July 14, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) was also closely monitoring the water levels in Hussain Sagar and updating the situation to the Revenue and Irrigation departments to take action. Luckily there was no danger from the Hussain Sagar.

Ancient lake may have lessons for current govt

“The full tank level is 513 metres above sea level. The depth is about 40 feet. If you look at Qutb Shahi era water reservoirs, there are overflow or surplus weirs. There are three or four sluices from where water is relieved from the Hussain Sagar in Hyderabad,” said Sighatullah Khan, an architect who runs The Deccan Archive (to document the city’s history).

Earlier, much before polluting effluents were pumped into the Hussain Sagar, there were functional canals of the lake. Water would be released outside during heavy rains through those. ”There is a surplus weir near the Sailing Club and other such canals. Bagh Lingampally was built on the edge of the lake earlier. There is an old photo of DBR Mills on lower Tank Bund showing the canals,” added Sibghatullah.

Even in 2020 when Hyderabad received torrential rains which flooded the city, the Hussain Sagar had not overflowed. Other water bodies like the Balapur lake not only filled up, but also caused destructive floods. The Hussain Sagar and its sluices for water management

History

The Hussain Sagar was built around 1566, about 25 years before Hyderabad was founded in 1591. The lake was built by Hussain Shah Wali, a sufi from Gulbarga. He who was invited to the city by Ibrahim Qutb Shah (1550-80), the third king of the Golconda or Qutb Shahi dynasty (1518-1687), which built Golconda fort and also Hyderabad.

Its construction was no easy feat. To feed water to the Hussain Sagar, the Musi river was diverted from the present-day Janwada area through a water channel. It was dug in 1565 and still exists to this day and is known as the Bulkapur channel. It brings water from the Kokapet Cheruvu to Hussain Sagar via Hussain Shah Wali Dargah and Hakimpet Cheruvu in Hyderabad

From the Hussain Sagar, water makes it way back to the Musi river from near Amberpet. The two-kilometre long bund of the Hussain Sagar was constructed in granite with sluices for irrigation and a surplus weir eventually. Hussain Shah Wali, a sufi (engineer) and son-in-law of Ibrahim Qutb Shah, was responsible for the construction. The lake was named after the sufi.

Ibrahim Qutb Shah then commissioned a second tank at Ibrahimpatnam which was named after himself. For centuries, the Hussain Sagar served Hyderabad its drinking water. Today however, it filled with toxic effluents and sewage which were pumped into it for decades.

Hyderabad was founded in 1591 with the Charminar as its foundational monument. It was constructed to mark the city’s establishment by Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah, the fourth ruler of the Qutb Shahi (or Golconda) dynasty. Prior to the Charminar being built, the Golconda fort was a walled city, from where the first three kings Qutb Shahi kings had ruled.",solution,Hyderabad Floods,"Hyderabad, Telangana, India","July 12, 2022","July 14, 2022",Domalguda and Ashok Nagar,Heavy rains,,0,,The Hussain Sagar has never really flooded the city in spite of heavy rains due to fool-proof ancient overflow channels.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Thousands whose homes were swept away now live in tents, kilometres away from their inundated villages and towns, after being rescued by soldiers, local disaster workers and volunteers.

The flooding has further exacerbated Pakistan’s economic crisis. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif issued an appeal on Wednesday from abroad, urging philanthropists to help flood-affected areas in Pakistan.

After inundating much of southwestern Balochistan and eastern Punjab province, flash floods also affected the southern Sindh province. Authorities this week closed schools in Sindh and Balochistan.

Monsoon rains, which started in mid-June, were expected to continue this week, mainly in the south.

Murad Ali Shah, the top elected official in Sindh province, said the situation was worse than in 2010, when floods killed at least 1,700 people in Pakistan, mostly in Sindh. “We are doing our best to evacuate people from flood-hit areas,” he said on Tuesday.

Floods have damaged as many as 129 bridges across Pakistan, disrupting the supply of fruits and vegetables and causing an increase in prices.

Experts say climate change has caused erratic weather conditions in Pakistan, resulting in cloudbursts and excessive melting of glaciers that has swelled rivers. They say that limiting planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions will help limit more drastic weather events around the world.

Large volumes of flood water inundated the stretch between Kompally and Dulapally in the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday, resulting in heavy traffic logjam extending into four to five hours on Thursday morning.

Several households did not get their daily supply of milk on time, due to milk vans getting stranded on the road.

“We got our milk at 12 p.m. today, and were clueless about what happened to the distributor as he was not answering calls. The kids had to go without milk in the morning, as we do not trust the locally available products,” said Y.Seetaram, a resident of Devender Colony in Kompally.

According to reports, hundreds of vehicles, including autorickshaws and four wheelers, were damaged due to the flood-like situation.

Several pictures of the swirling waters on the road, and of people holding hands and forming a chain to cross the road to avoid getting washed away surfaced on the social media. Residents expressed concern as this is reportedly the first time the region has seen flooding to this extent.

Irrigation officials attributed the flood to the backwaters from the Fox Sagar lake nearby which is filled to the brim. Close to 10 cm of rain on Wednesday night brought in a large amount of inflows into the lake, but owing to the limited capacity of the surplus weir, the water pressure worked the reverse way resulting in flooding of the road, they reasoned.

This was vouched by the gushing stormwater drains in the area. The flow of water had receded slightly by evening.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The National Remote Sensing Centre is hosting an experimental map showing low-lying vulnerable areas in Hyderabad. The map shows the contours of land and the areas that are likely to be flooded in the eventuality of heavy downpour. “The map if it can be juxtaposed with the 13 watersheds of the River Musi and Doppler radar information it will give a lead of three hours for planners and citizens,” says Marri Shashidhar Reddy former vice-chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority.

The map dovetails perfectly with the wishes of Mr. Reddy. Earlier in 2017, the Disaster Management Cell of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation had released information about 116 water stagnation points in the city. It also identified the number of families that need to shifted to higher grounds in the event of flooding. In contrast, the NRSC map of vulnerable areas of city is actionable. On Tuesday night and Wednesday when the water from Osmansagar and Himayatsagar reservoirs was released, the areas swamped included the exact area which the map showed. It also shows the low-lying area of Manchirevula which was flooded isolating communities in the area.

“The floods will become frequent in urban areas as the intensity of rainfall is increasing and the runoff increases,” said Kapil Gupta of IIT-B at a recent seminar. He shared data about how cities in India have been frequently experiencing rainfall >50mm/hour and even >100mm/hour.

“We need meteorological leads provided by Doppler Radar and hydrological information provided by NRSC to map localities. Rain at one or two places in Telangana doesn’t make sense. We should be able to tell people which area will get rain and where the runoff will flow,” says Mr. Reddy.

Hyderabad has seen frequent scattered urban flood events from August 24, 2000 flooding that impacted Begumpet after a deluge of 241.5 mm was recorded. In 2016 it was Allwyn Colony and Bandari Layout, in 2017 it was East Anandbagh Colony, in 2020 it was Falaknuma and Nadeem Colony and in 2022 it was Narsingi and Manchirevula.

While Hyderabad had very few rain gauges in 2000 it now has a mine of weather data. The Telangana State Development Planning Society hosts data from a network of over 1,044 automated weather stations throughout the State and nearly 132 in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation limits which gets updated every hour 24 X7.

While the Indian Meteorological Department’s Doppler radar goes offline often, the TSDPS data gets automatically updated.

Hyderabad: The Secunderabad division of South Central Railway (SCR) has undertaken major works to address the problem of water logging in Secunderabad station yard. As part of this exercise, for the first time in SCR, micro tunnelling method has been employed through Tunnel Boring Machines (TBM) to push the pipes in the station yard.

The SCR Secunderabad division team deployed TBM to create micro-tunnelling and a 1.8 diameter RCC pipes were pushed for a barrel length of 75 meters towards Vikarabad end of the station yard. The activity involved pipes pushing 14 crossing lines and several points and crossings, a press release from SCR said.

A drive pit was made wherein TBM was launched from one end by pumping water in the form of high intensity jets all along the circumference of the TBM. “Simultaneously, earth in the form of wet slurry was pumped out as TBM proceeded ahead. Utmost care was taken during the pushing to ensure smooth operation of the work, avoiding any slippages. Whenever rock was encountered during this work, longer blocks were taken specifically for the lines involved to clear the rock ahead of TBM manually,” officials said.

The entire work was executed by the divisional engineering team in coordination with all associated branches. The major work was executed without any disruption to train services. As a result of this work, the station yard will be free from flooding or water logging during rains.

He said that the Sindh government is carrying out relief and rehabilitation activities across the province, and the flood water is also receding while affectees have started to return to their homes.

The minister said this while addressing a presser at Sindh Archives Complex, Clifton Karachi on Monday.

He said that district administrations are providing the victims with transport facilities and ration bags as well.

While talking about the draining of flood waters, the minister said every area has its dynamics, in some areas, it will take 15 days to drain out water, other areas might take 30 days, whereas in some places take three months to drain out the flood water.

Memon said that the Sindh government is focusing on draining the stagnant flood water.

Apart from the utilisation of the heavy machinery of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, the pumping machinery of the Karachi Water and Sewage Board (KWSB) and Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) have also been mobilised to ensure the drainage of rainwater from the affected areas as soon as possible, he said.

Memon said that post-flood rehabilitation focuses on rebuilding the collapsed houses and rescheduling loans of growers.

In this regard, many companies and philanthropists from abroad have contacted the Sindh government and extended their support in constructing model houses, the minister said.

He reiterated that according to a rough estimate, the construction of a single-room house can cost Rs500,000, and if there are people in the country with the resources to build a village, or even a single house, for the flood victims, they should come forward and help the government.

As heavy rain during peak traffic is likely to result in more traffic jams, Hyderabad traffic police appealed to the citizens not to immediately start their journey after the stoppage of rain. ""Wait for 1-2 hours for the rainwater to drain out and also for the traffic congestion resulting from heavy rains to ease out,"" traffic police said in an alert. It also urged citizens to avoid unnecessarily or not-so-important travel.

Meanwhile, heavy rain in Vikarabad, Chevella and other upstream areas again triggered floods in the Musi River.

Gates of twin reservoirs, Himayat Sagar and Osman Sagar on the outskirts of Hyderabad, were opened to let out flood water into the river, which flows through the city.

Hyderabad Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) opened four gates of Osman Sagar to let out 1,552 cusecs of water. The level of the reservoir on Tuesday morning stood at 1,786 feet against the full tank level of 1,790 feet.

Two gates of Himayat Sagar were also opened to release 660 cusecs of water. The water level in the reservoir was 1,761 feet against the full tank level of 1,763 feet.

81,2230,hyderabad,2022,https://www.dawn.com/news/1707495,30 Aug 2022,Floods inflict $10bn losses across Pakistan,"KARACHI: The federal government has estimated a loss of at least $10 billion caused by weeks of torrential rains and subsequent floods, with Sindh, in particular, suffering damages of over $1.6bn (Rs355bn) as all major crops have been destroyed.

Speaking to the media, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail shared the damages estimate, saying the economic impact of floods would be at least $10bn, which is roughly translated to three per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country.

Meanwhile, Sindh CM Adviser on Agriculture Manzoor Wassan told Dawn that the heavy rains had destroyed cotton, rice, and date crops, causing a loss of Rs109.347bn. “Besides, chilli and other crops have also been destroyed by rain,” he added.

Mr Wasan said that almost the entire cotton crop standing on over 1.4 million acres, rice standing on 602,120 acres and dates on 101,379 acres had been destroyed. “Almost 50pc of the sugarcane crop on 729,582 acres has also been damaged,” he said.

Standing cotton, rice crops in Sindh destroyed; provincial government waives Abiana charges

Giving details of other crops damaged by heavy rains in the province, he said that almost 50pc of other crops of sesame, tomato, chilli, Kharif vegetables and onion had also been destroyed.

To a question, he said that there would be a great deal of difficulty in sowing wheat, which was due in the next two months. “The flood water is not expected to be completely drained out of the farmers’ fields in two months,” he added.

He said that there were unprecedented rains in Sindh, but the provincial government was doing its best to provide relief to the people affected by rains and flash floods.

The agriculture adviser said that he had distributed more than 4,000 tents, tarpaulins, ration bags and cash among the affected people.

He said that the farmers had incurred huge losses and they would be given relief to bear these losses. Revenue charges (Abiana) would be waived for kharif season 2022 by the revenue department, he added.

Mr Wassan said that date palm growers had lost their entire crop. “It has been proposed that case compensation may be given to them at 50pc of their crop value.

He said that a compensation package for the rest of the crops damaged during the torrential rains might be announced on a 50pc input cost basis, including seed, fertiliser, and pesticides.

To a question, he said that agricultural loans provided to the growers during Kharif 2022 in rain-affected areas might be rescheduled and the interest on the loans might be waived.

“New interest-free loans for rain-affected areas may be provided on easy terms,” he added.

Mr Wassan said that efforts were being made to protect the crops by extracting water from the fields.

“We are with people and we can’t leave them alone in these hard days,” he vowed.

The connectivity was once crucial in transferring the surplus water from Ambar Cheruvu to Yellamma Cheruvu during a deluge. Due to the absence of the connectivity during the October 2020 floods, the lake waters overflowed into low-lying residences in the locality.Speaking to STOI, D Krishna Rao of Save Our Urban Lakes ( SOUL ) explains that the lake is still struggling with new encroachments, which included the new Hanuman Temple being constructed at the lake.

Thousands whose homes were swept away now live in tents, miles away from their inundated villages and towns, after being rescued by soldiers, local disaster workers and volunteers.

The National Disaster Management Authority said Wednesday that 126 people were killed in flood-related incidents in the past 48 hours, with most of the victims being women and children.

The flooding has further exacerbated Pakistan’s economic crisis. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif issued an appeal Wednesday from abroad, urging philanthropists to help flood-affected areas in Pakistan.

Sharif is currently in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar, where he arrived on Tuesday, seeking financial assistance, loans and foreign investment for his cash-strapped Islamic nation. His government has promised to compensate those who lost homes in the floods.

After talks on Wednesday with Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Sharif announced that the Qatari Investment Authority is prepared to invest $3 billion in Pakistan. The trip is Sharif’s first official visit to Qatar as prime minister since he replaced Imran Khan, who was ousted in a no-confidence in Parliament in April.

After inundating much of southwestern Baluchistan and eastern Punjab province, flash floods have now started to affect also the southern Sindh province. Authorities this week closed schools in Sindh and Baluchistan.

Sherry Rehman, Pakistan’s minister of climate change, tweeted on Tuesday that local authorities are unable to cope on their own and appealed on the world community to help.

Pakistani Television footage on Wednesday showed people wading through waist-high water, holding their children and carrying essential items on their heads. Rescuers used trucks and boats to evacuate people to safer places and food, tents and other basic supplies were being dispatched to flood-affected areas.

In some places, the popular Geo TV reported, families struggled to bury their loved ones as local graveyards were also inundated by floodwaters. The TV broadcast footage showing mourners carrying coffins through flooded areas to bury the dead away from submerged homes.

Monsoon rains, which started in mid-June, were expected to continue this week, mainly in the south.

Murad Ali Shah, the top elected official in Sindh province, said the situation was worse than in 2010, when floods killed at least 1,700 people in Pakistan, mostly in Sindh. “We are doing our best to evacuate people from flood-hit areas,” he said Tuesday.

Floods have damaged as many as 129 bridges across Pakistan, disrupting the supply of fruit and vegetables to markets and causing a hike in prices.

Experts say climate change has caused erratic weather conditions in Pakistan, resulting in cloudbursts, and melting of glaciers that has swelled rivers. They say that limiting planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions will help limit more drastic weather events around the world, including in this South Asian country.

Parts of Ramanagara district were severely flooded following heavy rains that lashed the district on the intervening night of August 28-29, 2022.

On August 29 morning, a private bus going from Bengaluru to Kollegala got stuck on a flooded underpass in the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway. Locals used tractors to pull the bus out of the water. However, the bus broke down and could not proceed further, leaving the passengers stranded.

Former Chief Minister and Channapatna MLA H D Kumaraswamy, who visited the spot after learning of the plight of the passengers, called the Deputy Commissioner and requested him to arrange for an alternative bus.

Rain fury in Ramanagara

Near Sangabasappana Doddi, five buses and several cars were stuck in the inundated underpass for hours. Vehicles were later shifted with the help of cranes.

Abhishek, the driver of a bus ferrying employees of Bosch said, “There were around 30 employees in the bus. We were stuck for hours. At last, cranes were deployed to shift all the vehicles. Alternative arrangements were made for the employees to reach their destinations in Ramanagara.”

At Thikmaranahalli in Channapatna Taluk, after Malluru lake breached its bound, flood water entered agricultural and residential areas damaging properties.

Near Channapatna city, several residential areas were flooded with rain water. Over 200 houses in the low-lying Beedi colony were inundated, forcing people to shift to safer places. Residents of the colony said that incessant rains in the last day had caused them immense hardships.

Suhail Khan, a resident, said, “After Kudineerukatte lake breached, water gushed inside several localities. In our area, water started gushing inside the houses in the early hours of the morning.

Nodal agencies are now asking the state government to work on the master plans and implement them or else the city would be inundated not only during monsoon but every time it rains.

The three spells of devastation were not an act of God but the result of human negligence, an official said. Over three years, at least Rs 1,000 crore government property and Rs 5,000 crore private property had been damaged in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits, the official said.

The city has no master plan either for storm water drains or the sewerage network. For 9,000 km of roads, the city has only 1,000 km of storm water drains. The ideal figure would be twice the road length, or 18,000 km.

The city has only about 4,000 km of sewers, that too in the core city which are in need of an overhaul. The suburbs either have no drain network or the work to build them is incomplete. Hyderabad used to get about 750 mm of rain in a year, of which about 175 mm occurred in September. However, rapid urbanisation changed all that. For the past three years, the city has been receiving over 1,100 mm of rainfall every year.

The city witnessed massive floods in 2000, which resulted in an effort to improve the storm water drain and sewer network. The government hired Kirloskar Consultants in 2002 as technical consultants to draft a drainage master plan for the MCH area, then comprising 71 drains totalling 169 km in a 170-sq km area.

Based on their study, the MCH took up improvement of the Murki, Balkapur and Kukatpally nalas with Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) funds. The works could be completed only on a few stretches due to non-removal of encroachments and properties in the others.

The master plan prescribed wider nalas, with the intention that they should serve for 50 years. This required a large number of encroachments to be removed. The design was therefore modified with a one-year return. However, after discussions, it was proposed to retain larger widths for primary nalas which had large catchment areas.

As this was being worked out, the government merged 12 adjoining municipalities with the corporation in 2007, which multiplied the problem. It sparked rapid and uncontrolled urban growth and change of land use.

This impacted the network of urban lakes which affected the drainage of excess water when it rained. Lands were encroached upon and lakes became smaller. Choked lakes themselves became polluted.

Also, the Kirloskar and other studies were limited to the MCH area. The GHMC, which had become a 625-sq km behemoth, retained Voyants Solutions Pvt. Ltd in 2008 to draw up a master plan. They divided the GHMC area into 16 hydraulic zones and submitted the detailed project reports (DRPs) for 102 drains totalling 221 km in length.

The GHMC currently has 390 km of major drains — up from 169 km barely 15 years ago.

After the formation of Telangana, the government prepared proposals to widen nalas at 43 stretches over a total length of 100 km at a cost of Rs 2,300 crore to prevent flooding at most vulnerable areas. A drone survey was also conducted. The government sanctioned Rs 230 crore in 2017.

However, the works were stopped midway due lack of strong political will. The apathy resulted in flash floods in October 2020. Damage to the government property was estimated at Rs 567 crore in the GHMC area as also thousands of crores worth private property.

Putting aside Kirloskar and Voyants committee reports, the government asked the GHMC to prepare a comprehensive action plan to fight city floods and sanctioned Rs 910 crore to take up 64 works.

Then came the Strategic Nala Development Programme (SND), which officials call an eyewash. It is only an extension of existing networks with minimal land acquisition to widen the nalas, they said.

A civic official said the SNDP was resulting in waste of public money. Officials said without addressing the core problem by developing the storm water network of at least 15,000 km, the problem of urban floods would not be solved.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

What was the government order that protected the two lakes?

On March 8, 1996, the government of erstwhile (undivided) Andhra Pradesh had issued ‘Government Order (GO) 111’ prohibiting development or construction works in the catchment area of the Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar lakes up to a radius of 10 km.

Advertisement

The GO prohibited the setting up of industries, residential colonies, hotels, etc. which cause pollution. The total catchment area covers around 1.30 lakh acres, spread over 84 villages. The aim of the restrictions was to protect the catchment area, and to keep the reservoirs pollution-free. The lakes had been supplying water to Hyderabad for nearly 70 years, and were the main source of drinking water for the city at the time.

When and why were these reservoirs constructed?

The reservoirs were created by building dams on the Musi (also known as Moosa or Muchkunda) river, a major tributary of the Krishna, to protect Hyderabad from floods. The proposal to build the dams came after a major flood during the reign of the sixth nizam Mahbub Ali Khan (1869-1911) in 1908, in which more than 15,000 people were killed.

The lakes came into being during the reign of the last nizam Osman Ali Khan (1911-48). Osman Sagar was completed in 1921, and Himayat Sagar in 1927. The nizam’s guesthouse at Osman Sagar is now a heritage building.

Advertisement

And why has the government withdrawn protection to the catchment area of the lakes?

Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao said in the Assembly that the city no longer depends on these two reservoirs for water supply, and there was no need to continue with the restrictions on development in the catchment radius.

Hyderabad’s drinking water requirement has increased to more than 600 million gallons per day (MGD), which is being drawn from other sources including the Krishna river; water from the two reservoirs amounts to just about 1 per cent of the daily requirement.

Advertisement

However, officials said the government would continue to take measures to ensure that the water flowing into the reservoirs is not polluted, and would not allow unauthorised development or construction.

So, what is the government doing to ensure that the two reservoirs are not impacted adversely as a result of the withdrawal of restrictions?

The government has set up a committee headed by the chief secretary to frame rules and regulations of development around the two lakes. Several sewerage treatment plants are proposed in the area, and pipelines or canals will be dug to divert the treated water away from the lakes.

The government also proposes to establish large green zones throughout the area, which will remain free of any development. The committee will recommend ways to create infrastructure in the area, especially the laying of roads and drainage pipelines, without causing too much damage.

Construction activity will be strictly monitored and regulated.

What are environmentalists and activists saying?

Activist Dr Lubna Sarwath, state president of the Water Resources Council, says the government’s decision is reckless, and will doom the two lakes. “They are still an important water source for the city. My question is why destroy water bodies at all? A huge concrete jungle will come up around them. It seems the powerful real estate lobby put a lot of pressure. There are already over 10,000 illegal constructions around the two lakes,” she said.

Himayat Ali Mirza, a great grandson of the last nizam, too has appealed to protect the lakes from destruction and has asked the government to not scrap GO 111.

Torrential rain which resulted in flash floods in several areas in Sullia and Kadaba taluks surrounding Kukke Subrahmanya in Dakshina Kannada on Monday night damaged 30 houses. Of these, five houses have been completely or severely damaged, according to Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra.

He told Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai during a video conference on Tuesday that the family of two children who died in a landslip at Parvatamukhi, near Kukke Subrahmanya, on Monday, has been handed over ₹11.05 lakh as compensation. The children died when a portion of a hill slipped on their house. Members of the many affected families have been shifted to care centres.

Dr. Rajendra said that the ₹11.05 lakh compensation amount given included ₹10 lakh for the death of the two children, as ₹5 lakh each, ₹95,100 for house damage and ₹10,000 for the loss of utensils and clothes.

He said that rain has damaged roads in 23 places in the two taluks, including in Balugodu, Kollamogaru, Kalmakar, near Kukke Subrahmanya. Steps are being taken to repair the roads. Road connectivity to some villages has been cut off.

Flood water from Darpana Tirtha, a tributary of the Kumaradhara river, even entered the sanctum sanctorum of Adi Subrahmanya Temple on Monday night. Some commercial complexes in Subrahmanya suffered damage.

IT firms and banking establishments in the Outer Ring Road (ORR) area have incurred a loss of ₹225 crore owing to the heavy rains and flooding on August 30, said Outer Ring Road Companies’ Association (ORRCA) in a letter to Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai.

Seeking Mr. Bommai’s attention to address the “appalling infrastructure” in the ORR region in particular and the city in general, ORRCA said half a million professionals were employed along the ORR region between Central Silk Board and Krishnaraja Puram corridor.

“Heavy rains and flooding in the Outer Ring Road area on August 30, which brought parts of Bengaluru to its knees, led to a loss of about ₹ 225 crore in a single day,‘‘ the association said.

Revenue generation

IT firms on the ORR generate revenue of $22 billion every year, accounting for 32% of Bengaluru’s total IT revenue. The area was also the highest tax contributor to the exchequer, the association wrote.

“Poor infrastructure on this corridor, however, is bringing down the efficiency and productivity of companies located here and putting employee safety and well-being at risk. Flooding on ORR on August 30 has led to a loss of ₹225 crore as professionals were stuck on the road for more than five hours,’‘ ORRCA said in its letter.

Sharing its concern, the association further wrote that the inadequate infrastructure on ORR has now reached a “crisis level.” Even though only 30% of ORR population has returned to office, the collapse of the infrastructure has drawn global concern about Bengaluru’s ability to handle further growth.

Arterial roads

ORRCA has appealed to the government to expedite improvement projects on key arterial roads to ORR such as Old Airport Road, ITPL Road, and Varthur Road, as they are regularly used by their staff and the public.

The office-bearers also demanded that the detailed ORR BMRCL 2A metro rail project timelines be shared and strictly adhered to. There were several examples of planned road infrastructure and initiatives being stalled which has only aggravated the issues on ORR, it wrote.

Further cautioning the State administration, the association said it was in the collective interest of ORRCA.

The crop would earn him enough so that, as he puts it, his family of five wouldn’t be reduced to begging. Then came the deluge.

Pakistan’s massive floods this summer collapsed Mohammed’s home and destroyed his four acres of cotton, wiping out most of his income.

On top of that, his land and that of his neighbors remain underwater, three months after the heaviest rains stopped. Like many farmers across southern Pakistan, he may not be able to plant his next crop — wheat — in time.

That could spell trouble for the country’s food supply.

“These rains have destroyed everything for us,” said Mohammed, who lives in a tent with his wife and children near his wrecked house in Khairpur, one of the country’s hardest-hit districts. “We don’t even have anything to eat.”

This summer’s flooding, caused by monsoon rains nearly triple the usual ferocity, wiped out huge swaths of crops, leaving already impoverished families struggling to obtain food. Farmers and officials warn that Pakistan could now face serious food shortages at a time when the government is strapped for cash and world food prices are high.

Nearly 15% of Pakistan’s rice crop and 40% of its cotton crop were lost, according to officials. The waters also wiped out the personal grain stores that many farming families rely on for food yearlong.

The flooding, blamed in part on climate change, killed nearly 1,600 people, damaged nearly 2 million homes and overall wreaked damage estimated at more than $30 billion.

At the United Nations last week, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif told The Associated Press that crops on 4 million acres were washed away. “We need funds to provide livelihood to our people. We need funds to compensate for the loss of crops to our people, to our farmers.”

The government says there is no immediate worry about food supplies. In a statement to the AP, the state disaster agency said wheat stock are enough to last through the next harvest and that the government is importing more.

However, the upcoming wheat crop has been thrown into uncertainty. Planting usually starts in October. In Punjab province, the country’s main wheat producer, fields suffered less damage and can be sown in time. But in southern Sindh province, the second largest producer, some 50% of the fields remain underwater, according to Jam Khan Shoro, a provincial irrigation minister in Sindh.

Aerial footage in Sindh shows field after field still inundated. The province, in Pakistan’s southern lowlands at the downstream end of its major rivers, is where the floods hit hardest: 80% of the rice crop and 70% of cotton were destroyed, devastating the livelihoods of the small farmers who make up most the production.

Altaf Hussain Marri, a larger and relatively well-off landholder in Khairpur, said he normally gives away wheat as a gift to friends and family. Now he’s worried about having enough for himself and his children, unsure if his 400 inundated acres will drain in time. The floods demolished his cotton and rice crops, worth around $40,000.

“If we fail to grow wheat ... next year we might not have even wheat to eat,” Marri said. “It will create food insecurity in the country. The poor will suffer a lot. There will be no flour.”

Pakistan’s agricultural sector had been growing in recent years, allowing the country to export some wheat and rice.

“Now we will have to import wheat and other food items,” Pakistan’s Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told the AP.

Sharif, the prime minister, said Pakistan may have to import about a million metric tons of wheat, and it could come from Russia, but Pakistan is open to other offers if the price is right.

Pakistan has already put out orders to import 500,000 metric tons of wheat, Planning Ministry officials say. There are contingency plans to buy as much 2.5 million tons over the next year, but officials are waiting to see how much wheat is planted, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the policy was not yet set.

Ashfaq Ahmad, a senior economist, said the additional wheat needs to be brought in quickly, by next month.

Otherwise, “I am seeing a food crisis in December,” he told the AP. “Any delay in the import of wheat will cause food shortage.”

The flooding was also a blow to Pakistan’s important cash crops. Losses will mean lower exports of rice, which earned $2 billion in 2020. Cotton losses could hurt the country’s biggest export, textiles and clothes, which brought in more than $20 billion annually in recent years.

But the greater damage and danger is likely to Pakistan’s poor, with no margin to endure losses in income and food.

In Dasht, a remote district of Baluchistan province, hundreds of orchard owners worry about their future after losing crops of grapes, apples and other fruits. In parts of Baluchistan, piles upon piles of rotten apples can be seen in submerged areas.

Even before the floods, some 38 million Pakistanis, more than 16% of the population, were living in moderate or severe food insecurity, meaning they were uncertain about being able to obtain food or at times have outright gone without eating, according to the World Health Organization. Nearly 18% of children were acutely malnourished.

The blow to the food supply and incomes will tip those populations deeper into hunger, U.N. agencies have warned. The U.N.’s World Food Program has so far delivered food to 600,000 flood survivors.

Iqbal, the planning minister, said Sindh province is the country’s biggest producer of vegetables for domestic markets. Those crops were lost, along with families’ personal stores of grains for themselves and feed for their livestock.

“So, therefore we have a real food security challenge at hand,” he said.

On the ground in Sukkur, another hard-hit district neighboring Khairpur, the local agricultural director Rasool Bux Junejo fears the worst. Farmers won’t be able to grow wheat or other key crops like sunflowers and mustard.

“That will be a huge loss in the coming months. If you ask me as an agriculture worker, I foresee famine, God forbid,” he said. “We will be unable to provide food to our people.”

According to the latest report of the Pollution Control Board, 30 of the city's 185 lakes were reported to have gone dry in August, with two lakes identified as encroached and the other two as non-existent. Lakes in Shaikpet, Kukatpally, Medchal-Malkajgiri, and Qutubullapur were the most affected, according to the PCB report.

Four lakes in Shaikpet and Kukatpally have dried up as also six in Medchal-Malkajgiri and eight in Quthbullapur. The report stated that two lakes, Mangalavani Kunta in Hafeezpet and Thouthu Kunta in Khajaguda, were non-existent, while Khanamet lake in Khanamet and Masjid Banda lake in Kondapur were encroached upon.

Gurram Cheruvu, which had caused major floods in the Old City region in recent years, was also declared dry, which was also questionable.

Environmentalists voiced concerns about water bodies drying up or becoming non-existent, citing encroachment as the primary cause. ""The city has received excess rainfall up to 35% this year and at least twice it has witnessed flood in this monsoon season, then how come we have deserts within the city,"" wondered B.V.Subba Rao, technical member of Water Domain, Bureau of Indian Standards.

The main factors of lakes drying up are diversion and blocking of inflow rainwater from the lakes, encroachment on lake areas, and breaking of the surplus weir that holds water in the lakes, he stated.

""One needs to understand that most of the city lakes are chain lakes,"" city environmentalist D.Narsimha Reddy remarked of the environmental impact of city lakes drying up. With these reservoirs of water drying up, the future looks grim for Hyderabad. With lakes drying up and rampant concretization, the temperature in those areas will rise as these lakes play a major role in maintaining the micro-climate of the surrounding area. In addition, flooding and inundation will increase and many more areas in the city will go under water during heavy rains,” he added.

Dried up lakes:

Shaikpet: Thummala Kunta, Vatti Kunta, Kotha Kunta, Chiran Kunta

Parts of Hyderabad and surrounding districts suffered inundation following heavy rains since Wednesday night that flooded residential colonies.

People spent a sleepless night in low-lying areas as intense spells of rains lashed the city and suburbs with southwest monsoon turning vigorous under the influence of upper air cyclonic circulation.

At least 40 areas in Hyderabad and surrounding districts recorded 10 to 20 cm of rainfall during the last 24 hours.

Floodwater gushed into houses in some colonies in LB Nagar, Hayatnagar, Abdullapurmet, Saroornagar, Uppal, Ghatkesar, Boduppal, Peerzadiguda and other areas. Residents complained that every year they were facing the problem of inundation as authorities failed to ensure proper drainage and stormwater system.

MLA Sudheer Reddy's car was caught in flood water in LB Nagar when he went to visit some of the flooded areas. The MLA along with his staff was seen pushing the stranded vehicle.

Residents of some colonies near Saroornagar lake woke up to a deluge. The roads were completely inundated and the overflowing water from manholes entered the houses.

Road Transport Corporation (RTC) depot at Hayatnagar was submerged. A similar situation was seen at the local court and the fire station.

Teams of Disaster Response Force (DRF) of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) were on the field in the affected areas. Authorities have advised citizens to dial 100 or 040-29555500 for any emergency assistance.

Advertisement According to the data available with Telangana State Development Planning Society, Abdullapurmet recorded the highest rainfall of 21.6 cm. Bandlaguda in Uppal recorded 21.25 cm rainfall.

A couple of places in Hayathnagar received over 19 cm of rainfall. Few places in Saroornagar, Uppal, Medipally saw over 15 cm rainfall.

Rachakonda police rescued 30 people, who were stuck in flood water in Mallikarjuna Nagar, Ayyapa colony, LB Nagar areas. They were shifted to a community hall at Nagole. Police posted pickets at all vulnerable flooded areas.

The heavy rains and deluge revived the memories of last year's floods in Hyderabad and the suburbs. Over 50 people were killed in the flash floods in the state capital in October last year following heavy rains.

Meanwhile, Meteorological Centre at Hyderabad has issued an alert to Hyderabad and several other districts in Telangana. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected on Thursday in Hyderabad and surrounding districts of Rangareddy, Medchal Malkajgiri, Yadadri Bhuvanagiri, Sangareddy and Medak, Vikarabad, Nizamabad, Kamareddy, Siddipet, Jangaon, Adilabad, Nirmal, Khammam, Nalgonda, Suryapet and Mahabubabad.

Heavy to very heavy rains could lead to waterlogging in many parts of the low-lying area in these districts. It also warned of the disruption of rail/road transport in few areas of the districts.

With in 9 months of the last deluge, many parts of Hyderabad were battered and the normal life was derailed by a 10 to 20cm rain in several areas of the city. In many cases, the same colonies like Osman Nagar, Al Jubail and Omer colony in old city were hit hard which were flooded in October last. Bandlaguda, where many had died in the last flood, experienced large-scale havoc on Thursday. The area recorded the highest rainfall of 21.5cm in 24 hours.

With Meteorological Department forecasting more moderate to heavy rains over the next two days, administration was put on alert in the state capital as well as many other districts of Telangana.

Weather officials said that it was the third heaviest rain during July in a decade with aggregate rainfall of 6.9cm on a day. Normally Hyderabad does not see such heavy rainfall in July.

The rains plunged most parts of Hyderabad into darkness as electricity supply was disrupted, and the rains as well as the overflowing tanks submerged residential colonies and low-lying areas forcing the people to send SOS to the civic authorities. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation emergency teams had to use rubber boats to rescue the people from the flooded areas.

Many roads were also sunk due to the stagnation of water up to several feet raising serious questions about the standard of civic works and maintenance of roads.

People, who were yet to recover from the shock of last October when dozens of people had drowned or washed away in surging flood waters of tanks and drains, were once angry asking the government why it failed to learn a lesson from the disaster of last year.

Torrential rain overnight has left behind a trail of destruction in the city on Thursday morning, reminding people of the devastating floods in October last year. Several localities were flooded, forcing people to spend sleepless nights as rainwater entered homes.

Eastern part of the city recording the highest of 20.6 centimetres of rainfall, has taken the maximum brunt where overflowing lakes have drowned the surrounding areas.

Ayyappa Colony in Bandlaguda, a chronic inundation point, has received abundant flows from upstream of Bandlaguda Lake by dint of its location inside the Full Tank Level of the lake.

Kodandaram Nagar and Seesala Basthi, two more colonies prone to inundation, have been flooded yet again, due to surplus water from the Saroornagar.

In Hayatnagar, flood water from Kummari Kunta lake entered homes in Padmavathi Nagar Colony, while the same from Bairamalguda Lake drowned areas such as Altaf Nagar, Sainagar, and Harijana Basthi.

GHMC officials informed that efforts were continuously on to clear water from affected areas, and several families have been shifted to function halls close by.

As per the readings from the automatic weather stations across the city, Bandlaguda in Uppal received the highest rainfall at 20.6 centimetres, while areas including Hayatnagar, Saroornagar, Ramanthapur, Hasthinapuram, Nagole, L.B.Nagar, Lingojiguda, and Rajendranagar received very heavy rainfall ranging between 12-19 centimetres.

Other localities receiving heavy rainfall include Saidabad, Musheerabad, Bahadurguda, Charminar, Kapra, Marredpally, Nampally, and Asifnagar.

VIjayalakshmi has boasted about the ability of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) in handling flood situation in the twin cities, several nalas and storm water drains overflowed in Sunday’s rains, including in Nacharam, Miyapur, Gachibowli, Kukatpally, Narayanguda, Adikmet, Balkampet and Serilingampally, apart from stretches along Musi River.

Most nalas have no fencing, which means invitation for a tragedy. A seven-year-old boy B. Anand Sai drowned in an open drain at Old Bowenpally on Saturday. He accidentally fell into the nala, as the damaged fencing around it had not been repaired since 2020. This is the second such incident in Hyderabad. Last September, a 12-year-old girl named Sumedha Kapuria died after falling into an open drain at Neredmet.

At the time, municipal administration and urban development minister K. T. Rama Rao asked GHMC officials to ensure covers for all manholes and chain fencing of nalas. He made an administrative sanction of Rs. 300 crore for the purpose. However, his instructions fell on deaf ears.

At many places, there are no covers on nalas. Several areas lack street lights, increasing the chances of accidents at night. When it rains heavily, it is very difficult to identify nalas from roads. Says Bhavaninagar resident Satish Reddy, “Thousands of commuters take the route connecting Mallapur and Nacharam, where a chain fence along the nala would help. It is very risky to take this route during night. Despite several complaints, this issue has remained unresolved,” the resident pointed out.

Moreover, due to lack of fencing, residents dump waste into the drain. “We can see piled up garbage in these open drains,” says Manohar, a techie who resides in Adikmet. “A fence along the drain would keep commuters safer,” he underlined.

Residents of Old City and IT Corridor say they have not seen a fence along the drains. “Leave alone cleaning drains near Chaderghat, municipal authorities have not even fenced it. This open drain is an invitation to a disaster,” said Iqbal Pasha.

Remember the line ‘Water, water, everywhere, not a drop to drink’ from Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s ‘The Rime of the Ancient Mariner’? When the city gets battered during monsoon and low-lying colonies are inundated each year, the line assumes more relevance. In a passing scene in debut writer-director Sujana Rao’s Telugu film Gamanam , an elderly lady in a slum questions why water channels are encroached upon and turned into high rises, allowing no room for rainwater to drain. Neither is it one of the best scenes in the film nor does the question come across as forceful, but the relevance is hard to miss.

Sujana Rao presents three stories that cut across age groups and social segments in Hyderabad and shows what the deluge can mean to different people. Water is the ever-present additional character. At first, we see women in a slum line up near a tanker to get their daily quota of water. Elsewhere, a young ragpicker chances upon a bottle of mineral water and treasures it. Later, the life-giving water threatens to consume a few characters, while it makes the others reassess their priorities and step out of their preconceived notions. Binding the stories deftly is Ilaiyaraaja’s background music, filling the scenes soulfully with joy, poignancy or indicating a looming threat, the way only he can. There are scenes where next to nothing is spoken; words become redundant when the music does the deed.

Gamanam Cast: Shriya Saran, Shiva Kandukuri, Priyanka Jawalkar

Direction: Sujana Rao

Music: Ilaiyaraaja

Kamala (Shriya Saran) is a hearing impaired mother of an infant in a slum, trying to make ends meet while waiting for her husband to return from Dubai. With an undercurrent of pathos, it is a story that can be used to emotionally manipulate viewers to pity the woman. However, the story progresses to show how Kamala draws on her innate strength to fight for survival. Shriya enacts Kamala with conviction, revelling in the opportunity to deliver a moving performance. The scene in which she reacts to the different sounds and later her child’s giggles can make your eyes well up and leave you with a smile.

Running parallel to this is the story of young love and aspirations. Ali (Shiva Kandukuri) is a cricketer who aspires to be in team India. His humble family background, contrasted with that of his lady love Zara (Priyanka Jawalkar), could have been a regular story of a poor boy and a rich girl. What makes this story interesting is the added layer of the ideals his grandparents live by and in turn, expect him to follow. Charu Hasan plays the grandfather with warmth and assertiveness. There’s a scene of him cooking for his grandson and nudging his wife to steer clear of the kitchen. The film shines in moments such as these. The scene of conflict between Zara’s father (Sanjay Swaroop) and Ali’s family could have been been handled better. Its clumsy beginning is salvaged to an extent by Charu Hasan’s performance.

The third story is of two street kids who are rag pickers; nameless people in the burgeoning metropolis. Again, this could have been a soppy, tearjerker story but is narrated with warmth. There are enough scenes to portray their innate helplessness, contrasted with children who grow up in sheltered households. The story outlines how these boys, rather than wallow in self pity, try to make things work. The casting works to the film’s advantage, with the child actors turning in effective portrayals.

Shiva Kandukuri and Priyanka Jawalkar also make their presence felt with earnestness. Nithya Menen appears in a cameo at a crucial juncture. One of the big disappointments, however, is how a terrific actor like Suhas is wasted in a friend’s role. After Colour Photo and Family Drama , it feels like a crime to waste him.

When the deluge happens, the characters are pushed to the brink and forced to punch well beyond their weight. The stories do get predictable and emotional. The cues planted well ahead are an indication of things to come. The clay Ganeshas in the case of the street kids and early on, Ali stating that he will be written about in the newspapers, for instance. Smarter writing could have sidestepped the predictability.

Gamanam does not live up to its potential of being an absorbing survival drama. But despite the rough edges and predictable pitfalls, it holds its own and narrates stories with conviction, and marks the arrival of yet another new director who is unafraid to go against mainstream Telugu film tropes.",flood,Hyderabad Floods,"Hyderabad, India","October 13, 2020","October 16, 2020","['Hyderabad', 'Secunderabad', 'Kukatpally', 'Gachibowli', 'L.B.

As the monsoon is expected to intensify in the coming weeks, residents say that they are yet to recover from the impact which was created by last year’s deluge.Many families slammed elected representatives and government authorities for inaction since the past one year.A 60-year-old resident of Osman Nagar, Syed Waheed Rahman said, “After our house was flooded with nearly 10 feet of rainwater last year, we were forced to leave and look for a rented place near Pahadi Shareef. For about four months, I used to travel 5 to 6 km to check on my submerged house and see if the water level has receded. The situation is no different this year. The water from nearby Osman Nagar lake gushed into our house just after two spells of rain last week.”Even today, Rahman and his family members have no other way but to wade through the slush and sewage water that is still accumulated in front of his house whose foundations are gradually deteriorating because of the inundation.As the monsoon keeps them on tenterhooks, many say that they are having sleepless nights as the water levels of Osman Nagar lake rise with each spell of rain.“We are having sleepless nights as the water levels of Osman Nagar lake have started to rise again.

114,2263,hyderabad,2021,https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/270721/urban-floods-could-be-prevented-experts.html,27 Jul 2021,Urban floods could be prevented: Experts,"HYDERABAD: With India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting heavy to very heavy rainfall in the next few days, the civic authorities are still racking their brains over how to tackle a probable flood, despite having several recommendations by experts to prevent any such disasters.

After turning its back on Kirloskar and Voyants Consultancy recommendations on how to prevent urban flooding, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) authorities seem to be paying no heed to key suggestions made by Dr Kapil Gupta, professor, civil engineering department, IIT Bombay on urban flooding in 2018.

The expert said days of non-stop rains in the past exposed Hyderabad's inability to deal with urban flooding. If the recommendations were implemented in a span of three years, the city might have protected several areas from submergence and could avoid huge property loss, especially during flash floods in October last year and floods during the current month.

In the current situation, flooding is caused as the development of the sewer system is very slow and due to indiscriminate constructions along natural drainage.

There are some other bottlenecks that are becoming obstacles for smooth flow flood water. However, removal of bottlenecks can stop 70 per cent of flooding in Hyderabad. One of the key observations was to increase the number of automatic weather stations (AWS) to prepare for the flood situation. There should be an AWS for every 4 sq kms. However, there are only 33 AWS against the 207 AWS to cover the entire GHMC area, that too, 50 percent are defunct which proved costly during the recent floods.

Officials said Kapil Gupta, in his recommendations, said unplanned construction in low-lying areas, solid waste in urban drainage channels and increased rainfall due to changing climatic patterns were some of the identified common causes of urban flooding in Hyderabad. A few of his observations and recommendations include, land use changes, surface sealing due to urbanisation (which increases run-off), occupation of flood plains and obstruction of flood flows, urban heat island effect (which has increased the rainfall in and around urban areas), sudden release of water from dams located upstream and the failure to release water from dams resulting in backwater effect.

The indiscriminate disposal of solid waste into urban water drains and channels is a major impediment to water flow during the monsoon season. He also emphasised that it was important to understand the watershed and the vulnerability of each area. The vulnerable area should be identified and a method for mobilisation of resources should be known. Hyderabad is home to three main water bodies namely Hussain Sagar, Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar.

Unregulated urbanisation, land encroachment, building of wrong structures in wrong places were the main reasons for urban flooding, he said, adding that we saw it in many states now and none of the states had started demarcation of flood zones.

The flood management expert also suggested to avoid urban flooding in Hyderabad, several infrastructural improvements were required. First, the existing drainage path should be well demarcated. There should be no encroachments on the natural drainage channels of the city. Storage of rainwater in tanks at the rooftop, intermediate, ground or underground levels can reduce the overflows and help in reducing urban flood volumes. Storage or holding ponds should also be provided at judiciously selected locations to store water during heavy rainfall so that it does not cause downstream flooding. Once the rain subsides, the water can be released gradually.

Gupta also observed that roads were surfaced and resurfaced several times, thus increasing their level above the plinth-level. Various cities, across the world, have constructed porous pavements. These allow the water to gradually infiltrate into the underlying soil thereby maintaining the pre-development sub-soil water conditions. Porous pavements are presently being used for parking lots, driveways and sidewalks. With reasonable safeguards, they offer an elegant engineering alternative for streets and highway surfaces.

Thus, porous pavements are an exciting example of sustainable building practice. Gupta also suggested constructing detention or retention ponds along urban drainage systems to provide temporary storage for stormwater peak flows and controlled pond outlets. Construction of a retention pond will also help reduce floods. In the low-lying areas, flood water has to be diverted to nearby parks and stored in ponds, for immediate results.

A senior GHMC official, requesting anonymity, said if these basic recommendations were followed properly, the city could avoid inundation to a great extent. He said some of the recommendations could be implemented swiftly due to their cost effectiveness, unlike Voyants, Kirloskar committee and JNTU expert Prof K Lakshman Rao's recommendations.

The proposal which had been gathering dust since 2017 received its demand back during the 2020 floods as the area became most affected by the heavy rainfall. Around 170 colonies in the area were flooded during the heavy rains, making LB Nagar one of the worst affected areas in the city.Even during July this year, LB Nagar saw a repeat of last year’s nightmare as existing drains overflowed into the houses situated in several colonies. Officials then conducted a detailed study on the existing stormwater drain network and came up with the measures required to improve the flow of water down into the river Musi. “That’s one of the main reasons for the estimated cost to implement the RCC drains has been revised from Rs 5.8 crore to Rs 6 crore,” a senior GHMC official said.LB Nagar does have a drain network of 40,137 metres and considering the damage caused by the October 2020 floods, officials chalked out plans for an additional drain network of 33,512 m.Officials said that the drain network would be linked from Nagole catchment area to the river Musi.

One year after the havoc, many buildings still vacant as people moved to other places

By Asif Yar Khan Published Date - 10 July 2021, 12:25 AM

Widening of the nala was taken up after the floods last year at Al Jubail Colony in Chandrayangutta area of Hyderabad.

Hyderabad: It’s almost a year since the fearsome floods of October 2020 created havoc in Al Jubail colony in Chandrayangutta. Another monsoon is here but the residents of the colony are yet to recover from the impact of last year.

The colony had remained flooded at least for a week then, with the trail of destruction that the flood left behind being quite widespread.

Dotted with several multi-storied buildings, the colony was much sought for its proximity to the main road. But that has changed now.

“Since the floods last year, we are not getting tenants easily. There was a lot of destruction around and people lost everything. Those staying on the ground floor were the most affected,” recalls Aslam Khan, a local resident, who says several families vacated their homes and left for safer places after the floods.

“People felt it was a big risk to stay in the area, so they moved out. Now many buildings are vacant, especially the ground floors,” says Mohd Rahael, who runs a house rental agency at Chandrayangutta.

Mohd Ishaq, a retired school teacher, who owns a house in Al Jubail, said for several families the rent was the only source of livelihood.

“People constructed houses in hope of getting some income by renting out the premises. The rents in the colony hover anywhere between Rs 8,000 and Rs 12,000 for a 2BHK. If we slash rents also, no one is willing to come for the ground floor. It is a big blow for middle class families who are depended on rents for a livelihood,” adds Ishaq.

However, according to the local corporator Motilal Naik, the people need not fear now.

“Widening of the nala was taken up after the floods last year on a war footing and the works are still continuing. I don’t think the scene will repeat,” he says.

Taking into account the historic extreme rainfall of eight consecutive days in 2016, the study found that in case Hyderabad received rainfall of 440.30 mm for 17 days, 334.23 square kilometres of GHMC would go completely under water. If it rained 624.2 mm for 19 days, 357.97 square kilometres of GHMC would be submerged.

The study, which was conducted based on a hydraulic model to assess the flood depth, revolved around building risk analysis and the effectiveness of various flood adaptation strategies to mitigate building risk caused by urban floods in a climate change scenario.

The GHMC covers a total of 650 square kilometres.,

The areas under the GHMC that are most vulnerable to flooding are in the northern sections of zones 1 and 5 — Kapra and Saroorngar falling under LB Nagar zone and southern sections of zones 13 and 15 — Karwan and Musheerabad.

Several low-lying areas in Hyderabad were flooded as heavy rain lashed the city and various other parts of Telangana on Saturday. In the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), L B Nagar (GHMC Office) received 78.5 mm of rainfall followed by Bathukamma Kunta (77.8 mm), official sources said.

Several other localities in the city witnessed moderate rainfall, they said. Nagaram in Suryapet district received 95 mm. Ranga Reddy, Kumram Bheem, Medak, Yadadri-Bhongir, Medchal-Malkajgiri and other districts also received rains, the sources said.

In Mahabubnagar district, the body of a man, said to be mentally unsound, was found in a low-lying area in Jadcharla town following the rain and the exact cause of death was not known immediately, police said. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) here said heavy to very heavy rain is very likely to occur at isolated places in Adilabad, Kumram Bheem Asifabad and other districts from Saturday night till Sunday morning.

Also, it said heavy rain is very likely to occur at isolated places in Mancherial, Nizamabad, Jayashankar Bhupalpally and other districts during the same period.

A sudden gush of about two lakh cusecs of floodwater on Friday, with the level reaching up to 10 feet height, caught the villagers unawares and scampering for their lives.

Tens of houses in these villages downstream the project were reduced to rubble. The villagers literally lost everything, except the clothes on their person.

Agricultural crops in hundreds of acres stood destroyed. Tens of cattle heads were washed away.

Nothing of the household items was left as the deluge gulped them.

“It all happened in a flash. There was no warning whatsoever about the impending disaster and we were left to face the fury. Now, our lives are in total ruin,” the sobbing villagers of Togurupeta and Mandapalli said.

In Pulapathur village, 12 people were swept away in the swirling flood in Cheyyeru, nine in Mandapalli and five in Gundlur.

So far, only 18 bodies have been recovered, with no trace of the rest.

Annamayya is a medium irrigation project with a gross capacity of only 2.24 tmc ft on Cheyyeru, a tributary of Penna river, in Rajampet constituency. It caters to an ayacut of 22,500 acres, besides fulfilling the drinking water needs of 140 habitations.

The Pincha project upstream breached, letting out all floodwater into Annamayya while water from Seshachalam too came gushing in because of very heavy rainfall, resulting in an overall discharge of over two lakh cusecs.

That pushed Cheyyeru river into spate, inundating at least 10 villages downstream in Rajampet and Nandaluru mandals, and leaving widespread destruction in its wake.

“It was nothing but gross mismanagement on the part of the administration. Didn’t they know about the flood when there was such heavy rain? Why were we not even alerted about the coming danger before it destroyed us?” angry villagers of Mandapalli and Togurupeta questioned.

Except some kind-hearted volunteers, the administration did not come to their help in any way, they lamented.

“Ours is the first village right under Annamayya project. We lost our houses, cattle, belongings…everything. Some of our villagers were killed. There is no place for us to go,” the surviving residents of Togurupeta, a hamlet of about 500 people, said.

The temple of the local goddess, which somehow remained intact, has now turned into the only shelter zone for the hapless villagers.

Mandapalli presented a heartrending sight. Two families were completely wiped out as seven people in all were killed in the flood fury. Another family lost two persons.

For 100-year-old Ayesha Bi, it was the experience of a lifetime being pulled out of her house with a rope tied to her waist as flood waters raced through the locality of Al Jubail Colony.

The frail old lady was rescued after a neighbour broke the asbestos ceiling of her house. For her son Muhammad Khaja, the saviour was a cellphone which let him contact his neighbour Babur Khan. “Babur swam in pitch darkness with a rope and cracked open the ceiling to pull us out at 2 a.m. Then we sat on the ceiling for 12 hours,” recalls Mr. Khaja about the intervening night of October 13 and 14 when water from the Palle Cheruvu mixed with sewage flooded his one-room tenement built right beside the nala.

Same old, same old

He shows a video shot at 10.30 p.m. on October 13, 2020, when water began to rise in their house and the family of four got onto the bed to stay safe.

Nearly a year later, the family had to flee their house again as sewage water entered their home on September 28.

“Nothing has changed. We live in more fear than before,” says Mr. Khaja, who drives a carrier auto for a living.

For residents of Kabgir Nagar and Hashamabad, the flood of October 13-14 is a memory that refuses to fade. While flood markers of September 28, 1908, dot the city from the Residency Building to Miyan Mishk Masjid, there are no flood markers for the October 2020 flood that wreaked havoc from Bandlaguda to Saroornagar.

“The water rose up to here,” says Muhammad Javed, pointing to a mark left by water above the lintel of his house. Mr Javed works as a welder in Musheerbad and saw the destruction of every household item as the water rose. “Now we don’t even have a TV, leave alone other electronic items,” he says.

The Telangana government handed out ₹10,000 as part of relief efforts in the aftermath of the flooding but for families it was social workers and NGOs that helped them rebuild their lives. “We got a mixer grinder from one NGO. We got other items repaired but the stench from the sewage stayed in the house for nearly three months,” says Daulat Bi who has lived beside the nala for the past 40 years.

The Gol Bungalow dining area of the Falaknuma Palace is easily visible from the house of Daulat Bi. But that provides no relief for Daulat Bi as the water from the hillock and the surrounding hilly areas floods her home whenever there is heavy rain. The sewerage line is connected to the nala but water races down the Falaknuma hillock which is at an elevation of 586 metres above sea level (MSL) to the Kabgir Nagar area which is at 521 MSL. The families are trapped between a sewerage line and a nala.

“When we came here, there were no houses. Last year’s flood was big and it repeated this year,” says Daulat Bi as she narrates how she ran with her family in waist-deep water to the nearby masjid with the family. She was luckier than her neighbour Faimida Begum who was bitten by a snake while waiting for the water to recede from her terrace.

The colourfully painted small one room, two-room houses appear to have a concrete slab, but have asbestos sheeting as a roof making it unsafe to climb up.

Realty rates tumble

The flooding of the nala has sent real estate prices southward. “We are flattening the ground so that we can build a house. The land prices used to be ₹25,000 per yard before the flood, but now it has reduced to ₹10,000 a yard,” says Mir Mudassar Ali, a realtor building a house on the other side of the nala.

“A woman got trapped here. Another was found buried in the muck there,” informs Shaikh Zubair pointing to the signboard of a milk kiosk. “I have reached out to the corporator and the MLA, but even the basic work of walling up the nala has not been completed. The residents vacated their houses but the civic body has not carried forward the work,” says Mr. Zubair, a social worker who lives in the area.

138,2287,hyderabad,2021,https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/hyderabad/hyderabad-telangana-rainfall-patterns-climate-change-urban-infrastructure-7591105/,26 Oct 2021,Hyderabad’s heavy rainfall trends reason why urbanisation needs to be studied in context of climate change,"Hyderabad was in the grip of fear after two consecutive days of heavy rains threw life out of gear on October 8 and 9. It was an eerie reminder of the deluge of October 2020 when the worst downpour in nearly a century resulted in urban flooding.

For three years in a row since 2019, Telangana, once known for its semi-arid climate, has recorded an excess of rainfall during the southwest monsoon. A change in the rainfall pattern is being witnessed in the state and its ever-expanding urban agglomeration Hyderabad. As much as it is visible, a recently released state government publication has, in one of its conclusions, noted an increase in rainfall in southern Telangana districts, including Hyderabad, as compared to northern and eastern districts, which show a declining trend in annual rainfall.

The analysis published in the latest edition of ‘Weather and Climatology of Telangana’ studied district annual rainfall data over the last 30 years. The declining trend is about 110 mm to 157 mm for districts of Nirmal, Mancherial, Kamareddy, Sircilla, and Suryapet. On the other hand, districts such as Hyderabad, Warangal Urban, Bhadradri Kothagudem, Jogulamba Gadwal, Wanaparthy, Mulugu, and Narayanpet are showcasing an increase of 25 mm to 75 mm in annual rainfall.

This is even as the eastern Telangana districts continue to receive an increased number of wet spells and also more events of heavy and very heavy rainfall days. A wet spell is a period when a minimum of 2.5 mm rainfall is recorded in a day and a cumulative rainfall of 100 mm is recorded in five or more days. Incidentally, 162 of the total 432 such wet spells between 2004 and 2020 were recorded during the last five years. Though the southern districts have been recording an increase in annual rainfall, the number of wet spells was on a decline between 2004 and 2020.

Year-wise heavy and very heavy rainfall events during the southwest monsoon season from 2004 to 2020. Year-wise heavy and very heavy rainfall events during the southwest monsoon season from 2004 to 2020.

The number of automatic weather stations recording heavy rainfall (64.5-115.5mm) and very heavy rainfall (115.6 mm or more), too, have been on a decline in southern districts. This is despite the state witnessing a rising trend in the number of heavy and very heavy rainfall days in the last 17 years.

Dr Y V Rama Rao, former Deputy Director-General of India Meteorological Department (IMD), pointed out the increased frequency of extreme rainfall events supported by increasing temperatures and humidity for these changes. According to him, the south-eastern belt of Greater Hyderabad, which includes Hayathnagar, LB Nagar, Uppal, Saroornagar, Malkajgiri, Kapra, etc, are turning more prone to extreme rainfall events in recent years. “We are witnessing dumps of rainfall in short spells here when other areas of GHMC are receiving normal rainfall. Climate Change is certainly one of the factors causing high impact changes in weather, but in this case, we need more micro-level analysis,” said Rao, the author of the publication and a consultant with the Telangana State Planning Development Society.

The deluge of October 13 and 14, 2020, in Hyderabad was one of the worst-ever extreme rainfall days in a century. In just 24 hours, localities such as Ghatkesar and Hayathnagar on the outskirts of Hyderabad had recorded 32.4 cm and 30 cm of rainfall, respectively.

Scenes of overflowing lakes, inundated roads, and floating vehicles have started becoming common as short intense spells of over 40 mm rainfall have become frequent. Dr Rao does not think it is only the changing rainfall pattern that has wreaked havoc time and again in Hyderabad, but the inability of the urban infrastructure to deal with the rains.

Dr N V Umamahesh, professor of Civil Engineering at National Institute of Technology-Warangal, feels rapid urbanisation and changes in land use have caused water bodies to shrink and nalas to be encroached upon while existing stormwater drains have become inadequate to carry more frequent rains of higher intensity.

Increasing the size of stormwater drains, he said, is not the solution, but instead, the government should look at developing technology to forecast the flows and control flooding in case of an extreme rainfall event to minimize the damage. Also, as the city continues to expand, it could be mandated that newer colonies and gated communities should have water infiltration trenches and mechanisms for water recycling. “By fully recycling water, we will be able to better manage our water supply and also reduce the stress on stormwater drains,” Dr Umamahesh said.

As part of a project from the Ministry of Electronics and Communication, experts from IISc Bangalore, NIT Warangal, BITS Hyderabad, and CDAC Trivandrum have been working on exploring technology to minimise the damage during urban floods. “One aspect is to be able to forecast extreme rainfall events two or three hours in advance. Secondly, real-time monitoring of rising water levels or waterclogging at different places using sensors on the ground. The project could not take off in GHMC,” Dr Umamahesh added.

Dr Umamahesh said researchers have developed hydrologic and hydraulic models that could locate areas that could get inundated. “In terms of risk, we tried to understand areas that are prone to flooding, depth of inundation, the velocity of flow, classify different zones, etc. You need data from the ground to calibrate these models and make them precise.” Based on the real-time forecast of rainfall and monitoring water levels, residents of respective localities could be alerted or even be evacuated in time. “You cannot undo the damage done to the city. It is not possible to prevent frequent urban floods now. The best you can do is prepare the response,” he said.

In November 2020, the state government announced the setting up of an exclusive project wing in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) to mitigate future flash floods in the city. The Strategic Nala Development Programme (SNDP) was mandated to study the existing stormwater drainage system across the city and identify critical narrow points, encroachments on its path, and related issues, before submitting reports to begin work in a mission mode.

Nearly a year after its announcement, no work is visible on the ground. When contacted, C Vasantha, the officer on special duty heading SNDP, said the tenders for the work identified are being floated, and awarding of contracts is in progress. Without divulging details, she said work on SNDP will begin next month.

As of date, authorities have identified 52 specific projects across six zones of GHMC and also in the adjoining municipalities worth Rs 858 crore. Of the total, 33 projects are in Greater Hyderabad, and LB Nagar zone tops the list with 10. Presently, 12 projects are under evaluation, tenders have been floated for eight and are being called for seven. Besides, Detailed Project Reports (DPR) for six projects are yet to be submitted by consultants, said sources. For all the 19 projects in adjoining municipalities of Hyderabad Urban Agglomeration (HUA), DPRs are yet to be received by SNDP.

Some of the work includes remodeling or widening of existing nalas, desilting, restoration of lakes, construction of new bridges and sluice gates, and allowing for diversion of runoff from water bodies to nearby colonies. According to SNDP, the problem of inundation of low-lying areas can be controlled to up to 50 per cent by taking up work on nearly 78 km of total 473 km in the first phase, covering 45 per cent of the drainage network within HUA. The rest of the projects are scheduled in phase-2.

Senior hydrogeologist BV Subba Rao, who has been studying the region for over three decades, said a ‘nala strategy’ which is not in tune with academic research work will do no good in preparing for a flood-resilient city. “We must first study the stormwater trend with the natural systems because the North East and North Hyderabad (Nacharam, Mallapur) have a different drainage pattern than the West. It is ministers and engineers who are talking about a nala strategy, but there is no synergy between applied academic research and implementation of the strategy.”

Rao, like many other weather experts, spoke of two things that happened. One, an increase in the frequency of isolated heavy downpours in city pockets, and two, a rise in temperatures between spells of rainfall during the monsoon. Such heavy spells of rainfall till a few years ago was common in Jubilee Hills and Madhapur, but now is mostly seen around LB Nagar, Saroornagar, etc, he said.

“Our focus is on studying action in the sky while the impact is on the ground. But the action starts because of the heat radiation from the ground that is caused by erratic urban development. The need of the hour is a comprehensive study on the city’s growth, heat radiation, and its relation with cloud bursts.”",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

On Wednesday night, panic gripped residents in some areas and they started shifting from their houses in colonies surrounding the Osmannagar tank near Pahadishareef after water started entering their houses.

By Telangana Today Published Date - 15 July 2021, 02:58 PM

Hyderabad: With heavy rains lashing the city for the last three days, those living in low-lying areas of the southern side of the city are apprehensive of a repeat of last year’s flash floods.

On Wednesday night, panic gripped residents in some areas and they started shifting from their houses in colonies surrounding the Osmannagar tank near Pahadishareef after water started entering their houses.

“Many families staying in Osmannagar, Wadi-e-Saleheen, Saif Colony and nearby areas moved over to safer places late in the night. Water had entered many houses in the area around midnight when it rained heavily,” said Samad Bin Siddiq, a local leader from Shaheennagar.

Residents of Al Jubail colony in Chandrayangutta, which remained in water for at least four days last year spent a sleepless night.

“Actually some people started posting videos of water entering houses. As the rains were heavy we moved to the upper floor and stayed awake till early morning due to the fear,” said Farhana Begum, a resident of Al Jubail colony.

Families staying in Moula ka Chilla, Yakutpura, Chacha Garage, Amannagar, Lalithbagh and Uppuguda also faced tense moments throughout the night.

In the morning, GHMC teams reached these areas and cleared water-logging. However, residents staying in low-lying areas say they prefer to stay away till at least the rain stops.

Landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rains have hit parts of western India, killing at least 36 people and leading to the overnight rescue of more than 1,000 others trapped by floodwaters, officials say.

Three landslides hit Raigad district on Thursday, a local official told the AFP news agency on Friday, as uninterrupted rain left thousands stranded in Maharashtra state, home to India’s financial and entertainment capital Mumbai.

“At least 35 to 40 people are still trapped, we are trying to rescue them,” the official said.

Raigad District Collector Nidhi Chaudhary said many people were stranded on rooftops and even on top of the buses on highways, she said.

Chaudhary said the rains had slowed and water levels were coming down on Friday, making it easier for rescuers to reach the area.

Elsewhere in the region, a house collapsed on Friday after heavy rains in the Shivaji Nagar area in eastern Mumbai, killing two people and injuring eight others, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.

In Ratnagiri district, 200 people were rescued from hilly areas on Thursday after the heavy rains, according to PTI.

In the coastal town of Chiplun, home to 70,000 people, more than half the area was flooded, the news agency reported.

BN Patil, district administrator of Ratnagiri, said he has sought the help of the army, coastguard and the National Disaster Response Force for rescue operations.

An Indian Navy statement said it has deployed helicopters for evacuating stranded people and sent rescue teams with boats to the region.

Last weekend, more than 30 people were killed in landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rains in and around Mumbai.

In Telangana state in India’s south, authorities on Friday sounded an alert as heavy rains caused floods in state capital Hyderabad and other low-lying areas.

Meteorologists said 300mm (11.8 inches) of rain has fallen so far this month in Hyderabad, known as one of India’s information technology hubs – the most for July in 10 years.

The floodgates of one of the main reservoirs, Osman Sagar, were opened for the first time in 10 years to discharge excess water.

Disasters caused by landslides and flooding are common in India during the June-September monsoon season, when heavy rains weaken the foundations of structures that are often poorly built.

The monsoon is crucial for rain-fed crops planted during the season but the rains often cause extensive damage and kill many people each year.

Experts said heavy rainfall along India’s western coast is in line with how rainfall patterns have changed over the region in past years due to climate change.

“The frequency and intensity of heavy rains has increased,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in the western city of Pune.

He added that the warming Arabian Sea was driving more cyclones and more intense rainfall over short periods of time.

While parts of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and its environs received an unprecedented 200 odd mm of rainfall in a 24-hour period, what exacerbated the situation was the flooding of the Musi, a largely parched and grossly encroached, and intermittently sewage-fed, river on the banks of which Hyderabad stands.

The river, also known as Musinuru, divides Hyderabad’s historic old city and the new city, just seemed to come alive, swirling, flooding the city’s already overflowing tanks and lakes, especially the Hussain Sagar and Himayat Sagar, submerging everything in its wake, with several localities being marooned or even submerged and at least 24 people losing their lives.

Taking a hard look at the floods and a petition filed by Mohammed Nayeem Pasha on the pollution of and encroachments on the Musi, the National Green Tribunal (NGT), on February 24, directed the Telangana government to remove the “huge” number of encroachments in “mission mode” and take urgent steps to protect and rejuvenate the polluted river.

The Principal Bench of the NGT ruled that the government’s “failure [to protect the Musi] is resulting in a water crisis, the spread of diseases and posing a challenge to food safety, apart from aesthetics and failure of rule of law...”. The Principal Bench pulled up the government for “not discharging its basic obligation” in implementing and following a 47-year-old law — The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 — and allowing untreated waste to be disposed of into water bodies feeding the Musi. This, the Bench ruled was in contempt of binding directions passed by the Supreme Court in 2017, mandating putting in place a requisite number of sewage effluent and common effluent treatment plants along the Musi by March 31, 2018.

The NGT order said the rejuvenation works on the Musi would henceforth be monitored monthly by the Telangana government’s Chief Secretary, and by the Ministry of Jal Shakti once every quarter. The Ministry, which is responsible for issuing the National River Rejuvenation Mechanism (NRRM) guidelines, will prescribe the steps needed to control the pollution and for the rejuvenation of all polluted river stretches in the country. In a bid to ensure an effective monitoring strategy, the Ministry of Jal Shakti will also supervise the setting up of environment data grids at the national/State/district levels.

On the same day, in another case, the NGT bench issued directions to all States to strictly follow the timelines that have been prescribed for the rejuvenation of polluted river stretches. It ruled that any transgression or failure to do so would attract the payment of compensation to the Ministry of Jal Shakti as per the formula fixed by the green court in 2019. The NGT bench also added that chief secretaries would be held accountable in case governments failed to pay the compensation.

Last January an expert committee set up by the NGT had visited various locations on the Musi in connection with the clean-up and rejuvenation and restoration works on the polluted river. The NGT team along with retired High Court judge Vilas Afzalpurkar visited Chaderghat, Bapughat, High Court complex and other places where the Musi river has a decent flow.

142,2291,hyderabad,2021,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/chennai-floods-climate-crisis-7618776/,12 Nov 2021,We must recognise cities as waterscapes,"Chennai is flooded. The north-east monsoon that has been hovering ominously over Tamil Nadu has brought with it the highest volume of rainfall within 24 hours in the last five years. It has also revived memories of the devastating Chennai floods of 2015, a collective trauma that its residents are yet to outlive.

In the last two decades, floods in South Asia have become urban — erasing the hubris that for long had separated city and country. Floods recur in major cities like Mumbai, Chennai, Dhaka, Karachi and Kathmandu, and accompany high-intensity rainfall events. In October this year, buses have floated down flooded roads in Hyderabad, while in Bengaluru, India’s first “greenfield” international airport got inundated, reclaimed by the water it had hoped to displace and divert with concrete.

In August this year, as monsoon floods raged across the subcontinent, IPCC’s 6th Assessment Report (AR6) was published. The report noted the increasing frequency of heavy precipitation events since the 1950s and inferred that they were being driven by human-induced climate change.

The climate crisis, if there was ever any doubt, is here. It has made extreme rainfall events more severe and unpredictable than ever before. However, it only partially explains the recurrence of urban floods. The complete story lies buried in the politics of land.

All cities in the subcontinent are waterscapes. They are threaded with rivers, speckled with wetlands and springs, and they rest on invisible aquifers. Yet, driven by a thirst for land, our cities are planned to subjugate water, not live with it. It is this land-centrism that undermines urban drainage.

The word drainage is derived from Old English, dreahnian, originally referring to the straining out of a liquid. Urban drainage, if it was to do justice to its etymology, would turn cities into sieves that allowed water to soak and pass through. This required safeguarding the numerous natural watercourses threading the city as they drain water away and sustain fragile groundwater aquifers. These waterways — belittled as natural storm drains or nullahs — have been sacrificed at the altar of land-centric urban growth.

In 2014, Gubbi Labs, a research collective in Bengaluru, established through geospatial imaging that 376 km of natural storm drains — encroached on and paved over — had disappeared from the heart of the Silicon Valley of India.

In 2015, the National Green Tribunal in India formed a committee to report on the status of natural stormwater drains in Delhi. On inspection, out of the 201 “drains” recorded in 1976, 44 were found to be “missing”.

In both cases, these “missing” waterways were either encroached and built over or connected to sewage drains. The apathy for restoring disappearing urban waterways, stands in stark contrast to the Indian government’s recent obsession with reviving ancient rivers.

Poor design and corruption — inseparable bedfellows in South Asian urban planning — significantly contribute to urban floods. Take the design of constructed stormwater drains. The size of their outlets should be based on the intensity of rainfall (mm/per hour) and the peak flow inside the drains. In most South Asian countries, however, either design guidelines are missing, or the outlets are too small to accommodate peak flow. In specific areas of Karachi, for example, stormwater drains from real-estate properties are directed towards main roads. Little surprise then that above-average rainfall produces flooded localities.

Similarly, by violating environmental laws and municipal bye-laws, open spaces, wetlands and floodplains have been mercilessly built over, making cities impermeable and hostile to rainwater. In almost all cities in South Asia, residential properties have been built on stormwater drains. In Karachi, due to such encroachment, the width of drains has been reduced from 200 feet to 20 feet.

Unfortunately, encroachments are always blamed on the urban poor who live precariously in low-lying drainage areas because of inadequate social housing. After the devastating Chennai floods of 2015, experts pointed out that the biggest encroacher of urban waterways and wetlands was actually the state government of Tamil Nadu, which had built runways, bus terminals and IT parks by paving over water bodies.

Ever since concretisation became shorthand for urbanisation, rainfall in a changing climate no longer finds its way towards subterranean capillaries or surface water bodies. Massive quantities of water released during intense short-duration rainfall now get diverted towards drainage networks which are either “missing”, or choked with debris, sewage and solid waste. Whatever water does manage to reach the nearest river finds that the bank has been converted to real estate, and the river bed mined extensively for sand.

The political response to floods has always been to transfer the blame to the skies. Floods were viewed as products of “fickle” monsoons and “unruly” rivers. In response, millions of tons of concrete were and continue to be poured into constructing dams, embankments, culverts, and sea walls. Ironically, as South Asian cities metamorphosed into impervious lumps of concrete, they invited floods closer home.

To heal the hydrophobia that has shaped our urban experience, we need to move away from land-centric urbanisation and recognise cities as waterscapes. We need to let urban rivers breathe by returning them to their floodplains. One restored lake or a reclaimed waterway, though welcome, is no longer adequate. The entire urban watershed needs to heal, and for that to happen, we need less concrete and more democracy and science at the grassroots.

On November 2 last year, Telangana government had announced to establish SNDP, a dedicated new project wing to plan, develop, and maintain a comprehensive stormwater drainage/nala system in Hyderabad. It ought to be an exclusive wing within the GHMC with the overall objective of mitigating the adversities of heavy rains/urban floods in the future.

This decision was taken after the devastating floods in Hyderabad on October 13, 2020. It was one of the worst natural calamities in the last eight decades. Several localities were inundated and the floods affected more than ten lakh families. Of which about one lakh families were severely affected with extensive damage caused to the properties. Many localities experienced a complete shutdown for more than a week.

Cut to July 2021, it has been a month since the monsoon arrived in Telangana. As per the annual report of the Municipal Administration & Urban Development 2020­-21 the Strategic Nala Development Programme (SNDP) is still at the planning stage and the feasibility report has been completed. The report was released by the Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development KT Rama Rao on Friday.

The government has sanctioned Rs 858 Crores for the development of Nala Network for high priority in the first phase.

""Feasibility report of the entire Hyderabad Urban agglomeration is prepared which includes an assessment of the total project cost of the works identified for immediate implementation based on high deficiency / non-availability of drain network, inundation points, number properties affected,"" the report said.

The report noted that it is evident from recent floods that the existing drainage system is not in a position to take the load of stormwater runoff and needs a practical and innovative solution to overcome the problem; practicality and innovativeness in terms of approach as well as financial resource mobilization.

""An innovative approach is more important to solve the problem of flooding rather than a conventional textbook type approach which relies on established concepts and designs,"" the report said.

The feasibility report noted under SNDP, 1452 Square kilometer total area will be covered by six zones of GHMC, Cantonment Board, Osmania University and 26 Municipalities / Municipal Corporations around GHMC (within ORR). The length of the existing Nala is 260 km

To map out SNDP, several meetings were held with field staff (Assistant engineers, Deputy executive engineers, and Sanitation staff) and public representatives of such Zone in GHMC and each ULB in surrounding GHMC (within ORR) for identification of problem areas in terms of the extent of inundation, number of days of inundation, number of properties & households affected due to flooding and Reasons for inundation like missing drain links between water bodies, bottlenecks in the existing drainage system.

These natural calamities have killed thousands of people, destroyed livelihood, and taken the lives of thousand of animals.

The natural disasters are mostly caused by cloudbursts and unprecedented heavy monsoon rainfall.

However, the true cause of a tragedy at such a grand scale always finds its roots in humans and the impact of their activities on nature.

Unchecked growth of tourism, proliferation of roads, railways, hotels, shops and multi-storey housing in ecologically fragile areas, and mushrooming of hydel power projects in ecologically-sensitive areas. In many cases, governance failures play a monumental role in causing such disasters.

2013 Uttarakhand floods

The 2013 Uttarakhand floods killed thousands of people leaving behind a trail of destruction. An extreme weather event turned into one of the biggest natural disasters in the country. But how was that a man-made tragedy?

File Photo

The answer lies in the fact that when cloud-burst hit Uttarakhand, the floodwaters, laden with thousands of tonnes of silt, boulders and debris could not find any outlet. These floodwaters otherwise take a natural route, including rivers and streams. These outlets were blocked with sand and rocks for the construction work. When the water did not find a way to escape, it inundated scores of towns and villages, submerging some buildings under several feet of mud, smothering life.

The downpour of water and rocks from the higher mountain ranges, in all probability caused by glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs), deluged Kedarnath temple.

GLOFs, or the explosive bursting of glacier lakes, are thought to be a consequence of human-induced climate change, which is causing rapid melting of glaciers in the Himalayas.

Forests were destroyed on a large scale, haphazard construction was taking place in sensitive areas and when the disaster struck, it was nothing like ever seen before.

Hyderabad floods

Floods struck Hyderabad in October, 2020, bringing life to a crippling halt.

In 1908, devastation caused by a cloud burst and the flooding of Musi claimed 15,000 lives and rendered 80,000 homeless.

Experts pointed that Hyderabad floods could have been avoided if only there was a proper drainage plan in place.

File Photo

Almost all nalas, storm drains, culverts are either land-filled and built over or simply filled with garbage and forgotten.

So, the water which once found a way to flow, has nowhere left to go.

2015 Chennai floods man-made

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has squarely blamed the All India Anna Dravida Kazhagam (AIADMK) government for the 2015 floods that ravaged Chennai.

The CAG report stated that the disaster which many have been made to believe as a natural calamity was a man-made one.

These houses and apartments were constructed by builders who are also land sharks who encroached and occupied the FTL zone and sold to buyers. Following the recent heavy rain that has significantly increased levels in lakes, people residing nearby are not just dumping debris into lakes and nalas, but also constructing boundary walls to safeguard themselves from water-logging.

A few residents told The Hans India that while purchasing house or flats they were unaware of the FTL zone. Many had bought houses at reasonable price.

Several residents of an apartment in the buffer zone have permanently installed motors to drain out water as their basement is frequently flooding and the foundation is getting weak. They were forced to take measures, they say, as the Neknampur area falls under the buffer zone.

The municipal corporation is not taking any measures to prevent the area from getting flooded. In order to minimise inundation woes, several residents have started dumping construction waste and making temporary arrangements to stop water flow.

The civic authorities said, ""GO 111 was issued in 1996, which ""prohibits industries, major hotels, residential colonies or other establishments that generate pollution in the catchment of Osmansagar and Himayatsagar, up to 10 km from the full tank level (FTL) of the lakes.""

The GO followed the precautionary principle to protect the reservoirs which mainly meet the drinking requirement of Hyderabad. The saddest part of the GO is, despite the protection of the lakes by the government, the rapid urbanisation and selfish attitude of people have resulted in encroachment of FTL areas and the catchment area of the lakes, damaging precious water sources.

However, due to the recent heavy rain the Himayatsagar and Osmansagar have been receiving good inflows. As a result, gates of both reservoirs are being lifted and water is being released into the Musi.

All other water bodies are overflowing. This has become a major threat for people residing in the FTL zone, as they are prone to face heavy inundation. Madhulika Choudhary, a lake protection activist said, ""The October 2020 floods in Hyderabad, caused due to encroachments, resulted in loss of life and property. Even after experiencing massive floods land sharks have not stopped.

A deep monsoon depression over the west central Bay of Bengal, which weakened as it moved over Telangana, resulted in downpours over several districts in the State, severely affecting the city of Hyderabad as well. On October 13, the monthly average rainfall of Hyderabad for October (103.6 mm according to Skymet) was surpassed on a single day when 192 mm of rain fell. According to the India Meteorological Department, this is the highest rainfall for October recorded in Telangana’s capital since 1903. Such a high intensity downpour in a short span is bound to affect a densely populated urban area, and Hyderabad was no exception. At least 24 people were killed and several localities submerged and isolated following incessant rains and the overflowing of the city’s lakes. Other districts were badly affected too: roads damaged and irrigation tanks breached. The monsoon storm that never became a cyclone, has managed to cross the east (Andhra Pradesh) and west coasts (north Karnataka and Maharashtra) of India. This is rare and a rain-related disaster event that is difficult to plan for. Floods and deluges, like any other disaster, disproportionately affect the poor. Disaster management agencies have managed to limit the impact of the disaster as many of those marooned in submerged areas and flooded houses were rescued. But the extent of the damage and the turmoil show a lack of preparation and disaster mitigation, a problem that plagues most urban centres in the country.

Much of the damage was due to the overflowing of lakes — in particular, the Hussain Sagar Lake in the middle of the city and the breaching of storm water drains. Construction over lake beds and encroachments of drainage channels have been identified as problems that have exacerbated flooding and inundation in the city in the past (the deluge in August 2000, for example). But the little that has been done to unblock existing storm drains over the last decade has not been enough to handle the requirements of the city, which still depends upon an antiquated sewerage and drainage system. Hyderabad urgently needs to expand and remodel its drainage system. Besides lakes and canals, wetlands and watersheds play a vital role in absorbing excess rainfall, but regrettably, rapid urbanisation in the twin cities has resulted in the loss of a large portion of the wetlands. An analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment in 2016 revealed that 3,245 hectares of water bodies were lost in Hyderabad between 1989 and 2001.

Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) has touted Hyderabad as a ‘global city’, the capital was hit by flash floods earlier this week and has remained cut off from the rest of the world after major roads were washed away. Experts have attributed this turn of events to poor urban planning, a woeful drainage system and the pitiable condition of the Musi river, multiple streams and water-storage tanks, as a result of unplanned urbanisation.

Most parts of Hyderabad lost power and internet connectivity for two days following the floods. The state government has already estimated the losses to amount to Rs 5,000 crore. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday, chief minister KCR sought immediate relief of Rs 1,350 crore from the Centre.

Although official figures aren’t yet available, reports suggest the floods have already claimed more than 50 lives in the state as well as have left thousands homeless (as on October 16 morning). Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, a member of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), said in a tweet on October 14 that a boundary wall (of some sort) had also collapsed in the Mohammedia Hills part of the city, killing nine people and injuring several others, many critically so.

Urban flooding

Some parts of the city reportedly received 32 cm of rain in 24 hours – the highest in a century. According to unofficial accounts, multiple teams of the National Disaster Response Force and army personnel have set out by boats to evacuate stranded people.

The last time the city saw serious flooding was in August 2000, with rainfall of 24 cm in a single day, claiming 15 lives. In 1908, the River Musi was in deluge, subjecting leading to as many as 15,000 deaths. This calamity prompted the government to rope in veteran irrigation expert Mokshagundam Viseswarayya for a study on flood mitigation. Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar were built to act as flood control centres as a result of the expert’s recommendations. But one of his vital recommendations – a modern drainage system – still remains a dream.

According to K.J. Ramesh, former director general, Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), urban flooding occurs due to the incapacity of the city to handle rainwater during extreme rainfall events. Speaking to The Wire, Ramesh underlined the need to build climate-resilient infrastructure in cities on a priority basis, as a deterrent against disasters of this kind.

Hyderabad is endowed with a system of catchments. Its western edges are in the Godavari river basin (from Kukatpalli, Ramachandrapuram to Gachibowli) while its eastern part is in the Krishnaa river basin. The Deccan region as a whole has a chaotic drainage pattern – water does not flow in a single direction, as the slope moves in multiple directions.

In a 2016 report, the Centre for Science and Environment estimated that in the last 12 years, Hyderabad has lost 3,245 hectares of wetlands. The report further said that urban water bodies have been a victim of unplanned urbanisation, facing serious threats such as encroachments, disposal of sewage and groundwater decline.

Musi’s fury

The Telangana Rashtra Samithi government headed by KCR established the Musi Riverfront Development Corporation and gave it Rs 1,665 crore in 2017, with the express objective of cleansing the river of encroachments and effluents. But the mission failed to move forward, though the corporation has paid Rs 3.15 crore in salaries annually nonetheless. A survey undertaken by the corporation revealed that the river that criss-crosses the city is cluttered with 12,000 encroachments in the form of structures of varying sizes. The decision to remove such encroachments is in limbo for want of permission from the government.

The government’s ‘lopsided’ priorities have been blamed for the nightmares the city is currently passing through. C. Ramachandraiah, a professor at the Hyderabad-based Centre for Economic and Social Studies, told The Wire that the TRS government in the last six years of rule only focused on flyovers and bridges, and actively made way for rapid urban development with a scant regard for flood mitigation plans in the city.

The course of the Musi river has been narrowed at many places in the city because of encroachments. Its path has to be straightened by removing high-rise buildings that came up on the river bunds to make way for free flow of waters. The government should prepare itself to relocate and rehabilitate the dwellers residing on the river bunds, Ramachandraiah said.

Nalas (streams) and drainage channels are getting choked with construction debris, and domestic and industrial waste, causing flooding, he added.

Who is to blame?

Everyone is complicit in making public life miserable in Hyderabad, says civil society member Raka Sudhakar. Governments in the past and present have been choosing nalas as ideal places for implementing housing schemes for the urban poor. The erstwhile Congress government proposed to build houses under the Rajiv Griha Kalpa along the course of nalas, and the present TRS government too has planned two BHK flats at the same places, Sudhakar pointed out.

People making a living on encroachments on tanks and nalas in the city are estimated to be between seven and ten lakh. That over 1,000 colonies were effected by the recent floods points to the volume of encroachments. No party, apparently, can afford to antagonise such a large number of people before elections for the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation scheduled in November.

Corporate hospitals and even luxury hotels have been allowed to come up on nalas, with impunity. Necklace Road was built on nine channels that bring sewage water into the Hussain Sagar lake from different parts of the city, but these channels are reportedly now narrow as a result of road building.

During floods, waters flow in the opposite direction, thereby flooding vulnerable areas for want of an outlet at the mouth of the lake. The authorities reportedly narrowed the outlets with meshes so as to prevent garbage and other waste from entering the water body.

Telangana State Pradesh Congress Committee (TSPCC) president N. Uttamkumar Reddy and BJP Union minister of state for home G. Kishen Reddy held the TRS regime squarely responsible for the city’s plight. Kishen Reddy said the KCR government turned a blind eye to its own agenda of the Musi Riverfront Development Project.

TRS’s urban development minister K.T. Rama Rao, in turn, taunted the Union minister, asking why he failed to bring sufficient funds from the Centre for city development. And so, the blame game goes on till the upcoming municipal elections.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Some experts claim it is a clear case of the impact of climate change causing extreme weather events. Others point out that it is an example of bad planning, encroachment of lakes and poor urban infrastructure and preparedness.

In addition to disaster management plans, cities like Hyderabad require a certain amount of climate resilience built in.

For residents of Hyderabad city in India, September usually meant caution as the month brought unusually heavy rains. The Great Musi Floods of 1908 that impacted most of Hyderabad was caused by an unprecedented downpour on September 28 that year and each year September has been the time for caution.

This year however, it is October that saw an extreme weather event that will be etched in the memories of the people. Sudden spells of heavy downpour, cloud bursts and flash floods over a week and especially on the intervening night of October 13-14, exposed the fragile and inefficient urban infrastructure of the capital of Telangana.

Some experts claim that it is a clear case of the impact of climate change causing extreme weather events. Others point out that it is an example of bad planning, encroachment of lakes and poor urban infrastructure and preparedness. Hyderabad lost 33 lives, nearly 40,000 families got badly impacted and suffered a property loss of Rs. 6.7 billion (Rs 670 crores) as per official estimates.

Hyderabad of October 2020, Chennai of December 2015 and Mumbai of July 2005 are definite cases of extreme events. They are wake up calls for urban planners to firm up strategies and implement measures to minimise the damages of such events, whose occurrence could only increase in future, say experts.

Annual average fatalities in India due to climate hazards are about 3660, which is the second highest in the world. The vulnerability of southern cities to urban flooding seems higher. Extreme rainfall events occurred in Hyderabad in 2016, 2010 and 2000. Kerala was swamped by floods in 2018 and Chennai battered in 2015.

Hyderabad witnessed a record rainfall in 24 hours

According to a recent study by the Centre for Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of Hyderabad (UoH), increasing urbanisation in Telangana and Tamil Nadu is likely to enhance the rainfall during heavy rainfall events by 20- 25%. The study by Karumuri Ashok and Boyaj of UoH was done in collaboration with Ibrahim Hoteit and Hari Prasad Dasari of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia.

The study used Land Use Land Cover (LULC) imagery from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and conducted a dozen simulated, heavy rainfall events over the three southern states. The changes in LULC led to higher surface temperatures and a deeper and moist boundary layer. This in turn caused a relatively higher convective available potential energy and, consequently, heavier rainfall. The precipitation levels during heavy rainfall events have significantly increased from 2000 to 2017. Their findings were reported in the ‘Quarterly Journal of Royal Meteorological Society’ on May 18, 2020.

Incidentally, Hyderabad celebrated its 429th foundation day on October 7-8. Even before the celebrations, subdued due to the pandemic, dark, rain-bearing clouds converged over the city because of a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal. Consequently, on October 13-14, the tri-city — Hyderabad, Secunderabad and Cyberabad — an extent of 650 sq km, got battered with an all-time record rainfall of 29.8 cms in 24 hours. The August 2000 downpour was recorded at 24 cm. For the record, the single-day highest rainfall record in the state of Telangana is 35.5 cms in October 1983 in Nizamabad.

According to B. Raja Rao, of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad, “The unusually heavy rainfall was due to two reasons. The deep depression in the Bay of Bengal that moved onto the land in Hyderabad. The second was the rain bearing clouds of the withdrawing Southwest monsoon also pouring out.”

People in large parts of Hyderabad woke up to water everywhere and many lives thrown out of gear. Several low lying localities were deluged in the water from rains and overflowing water bodies.

The growth of Hyderabad along a river

Hyderabad was built along the river Musi, one of the tributaries of river Krishna. The city was spread over 55-60 sq km during the 1908 floods. Learning lessons from the natural disaster, the Nizam sought the help of the renowned engineer Sir Mokhshagundem Visweswarayya for long term flood protection. He designed an underground drainage system, two balancing reservoirs, Himayathsagar and Osmansagar and a sewage treatment plant. The Hussainsagar, which links the twin cities too came up around that time

Post Independence, with its multiple advantages, Hyderabad grew rapidly as the home for public sector organisations, emerged as the place for bulk pharmaceutical drugs and home to many national research institutes as well. Post economic liberalisation in the 1990s, the neo rich, farmer turned industrial entrepreneurs from coastal Andhra Pradesh, shored up city’s land as a huge, desirable asset, propelling a real estate boom. The inflow of foreign direct investment and coming in of global IT majors such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, Infosys and e-commerce giants such as Amazon, Walmart to IKEA have transformed Hyderabad.

Consequently, in 2020, the sprawling metropolis administered by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) is teeming with close to 10 million people. In contrast, the number of water bodies is down to just 190 from over 2500 in 1970. Even this number is contested by environmental groups.

“Both, the ‘elected’ (MPs, MLAs, Corporators etc) and ‘selected’ (bureaucrats, revenue officials, GHMC) are responsible for a situation wherein, instead of the rainwater flowing into the river, it is rushing into homes”, alleged Lubna Sarwat, who championed Save Our Urban Lakes (SOUL), a citizen’s initiative to save the lakes of Hyderabad.

In this rapid urbanisation, greed and lack of perspective growth plans, lands in river beds have been grabbed in the name of religious buildings and scores of colonies and apartment complexes have been built by all influential sections from politicians to real estate developers and law makers to industrial leaders, she alleged.

Need for a disaster management plan

The State Minister for Urban Development and IT, KT Rama Rao, had announced days before the flooding that the TRS Govt had spent Rs 67,500 crores on the development of urban infrastructure to prepare Hyderabad to emerge as a global city since 2015.

The government had firmed up a Musi River Front Project too. Its dreams of realising the expansion of the metropolis through the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA), which extends to 7500 sq kms (size of Goa) call for dramatic and long term reforms in land use, building construction and infrastructure.

“With the Krishna and Godavari river basins too coming into the picture with water supply being brought to Hyderabad from long distances through pipelines, there is an urgent need to have an expert commission to devise land use plans, drainage and sewage systems and disaster mitigation,” said Ananth Mariganti, from the Hyderabad Urban Labs.

“Hyderabad and even Telangana state do not have a disaster management plans. They are not fully utilising the doppler radar, which can give advance and precise warnings. The focus is on disaster response, even while allowing unplanned growth,” said Marri Shashidhar Reddy, former vice chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).

A former MLA, Reddy suggests annual desilting of storm drains, utilisation of weather data and an overall Master Plan to make Hyderabad ready to face disasters in the long run. With nearly 50 percent of revenues of the state and huge presence of industry, the economic loss of extreme events can be disastrous, he warned.

There is a need for exploring the concept of climate proofing cities, said V. Srinivasa Chary of the Centre for Urban Governance and Infrastructure Development, Environment & Energy at the Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI). In addition to disaster management, cities too require a certain amount of resilience built in. Hyderabad is a fit case to identify ‘hot spots’ for flooding, design materials and systems that will withstand such events.

The message for help was on social media within hours of the beginning of the downpour on Tuesday night . The location: Chakradhar Colony, Nagaram. A quick search on the map reveals the colony to be built to the north of the Nagaram lake. Search for the locality 20 years ago and it doesn’t exist. Twenty years ago, the land where the colony exists now was part of the lake. Till 2015 the colony didn’t exist.

The same story repeats in various other localities where flooding has wrecked havoc due to the heaviest rainfall in recorded history in Hyderabad. Boduppal, Bandari Colony, Nadeem Colony, Macca Colony, Singareni Colony, Vambay Colony and Gaganpahad area. A corollary to the flooding in these localities is no change in the water quality or levels in the lake near Taj Banjara Hotel, Masab Tank and Mir Alam Tank. On Thursday when the city was coming to terms with the flood and estimating the damage, rain water didn’t even dislodge the water hyacinth plants in the Mir Alam Tank or the pond scum in Masab Tank.

Housing colonies

But the same could not be said about the lakes and tanks in the southern part of Hyderabad. Yerra Kunta, Madikunta, Jalapalli, Umda Sagar and Palle Cheruvu were just a series of interconnected lakes bound by rocks and natural terrain about 20 years ago. But a series of housing colonies for the poor built on land reclaimed from lakes and encroachments by prospectors has shrunk the lakes. On Thursday water overflowed the lakes and flowed onto the roads and open spaces. But on Wednesday at about 1.20 a.m., water from these lakes had raced onto opens spaces and crashed a wall, upturned vehicles plying on roads and killed at least three persons in the Gaganpahad area.

“What could have been a miracle of nature has been turned into an object of terror due to government policies,” says Lubna Sarwath of Save Our Urban Lakes who has been campaigning against encroachments in lake beds. “We need a mechanism like lake tribunals that will take quick and informed decisions rather than depend on civil courts which take time,” says Ms. Sarwath.

Incidentally, the flooding has affected many plots that have been created on the lake beds near Jalapally. “Encroached land is almost free but if the same plot has to be purchased it will cost a lot. That’s why lake beds have become easy targets. It is not population pressure but land value pressure that is driving this destructive growth,” says B. V. Subba Rao who works in the field of convergence and sustainability.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

But even as the city, established by Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah of the Qutb Shahi dynasty in 1591, expanded beyond the fortified walls of the Golconda, the heart-shape lake built across a tributary of the river Musi, was only one of the several hundreds of lakes that dotted the region.

In less than a century, the city has expanded from 55 sq.km to 625 sq.km under the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). The jurisdiction of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) spreads over 7,257 sq.km covering parts of a few neighbouring districts as well, and had 2,800 lakes as per as 2017 estimate.

The water bodies were created for drinking water and irrigation purposes at a time when water management was considered crucial in this otherwise arid region for centuries. This network of man-made water bodies, interconnected by several natural waterways, ultimately led to the River Musi in most cases. Along with these small lakes, in the aftermath of the 1908 floods in Hyderabad, the Nizam government commissioned two big reservoirs, Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar, on the periphery of the city to regulate the water flow from Musi and its tributary Esa.

But the rivers have since vanished. Discharge of sewage and industrial effluents, encroachments by government and private individuals, and decades of neglect had everyone thinking the river would never flow again. Most of the former waterways are open sewers now. But, on October 13, the river was in spate once again after a record downpour. Low-lying localities and colonies that were built on the lake beds and nullahs were submerged in no time. Many days later, hundreds of these colonies were still under water.

Between the Krishna and the Godavari

Based on hydrology, present-day Hyderabad can be divided into Krishna and Godavari basins. Traditionally, all the rainwater falling in the catchment areas of Musi would discharge into Musi which is one of the 22 tributaries of the Krishna river. And newer localities to the west of Hyderabad, including Gachibowli and the IT corridor, are all in the catchment areas of the Godavari.

In both Krishna and Godavari basins, the city has a network of lakes and drains which carry the excess water from one to another and then finally into the Musi and Majeera rivers.

Senior Hydrogeologist BV Subba Rao says lakes were built in the past based on the natural topography and rainfall trends. “These were not created for flood control mitigation but as draught mitigation structures. Every 2 sq.km had a lake to ensure water for drinking and irrigation purposes to every habitation. Flood regulation was only one of the purposes,” he explains.📣 Follow Express Explained on Telegram

The forgotten lakes

Over the years, owing to the expansion of the city, the lakes were not in demand for their primary purposes of irrigation and drinking water. But they continued to be relevant for flood regulation.

Despite this, in the last few decades, several colonies, as well as large real estate ventures, have come up in the full-tank levels — the buffer area — of lakes, large water bodies that existed for centuries have shrunk in size, encroachments have eaten into natural waterways, and stormwater drains get easily clogged.

As per the GHMC data, parts of the Nadeem Colony abutting Shah Hatim Talab had water rise to 12 feet after the downpour on October 13. Devi Nagar and Chudi Bazaar colonies in Goshamahal saw the water rise to 10 feet. Similar were the scenes in several other colonies like Hafiz Baba Nagar, Al Jubail Colony, Ghazi-e-millat colony, Chandrayangutta, Ghouse Nagar, Moin Bagh, Edi Bazaar, Talab Katta and Riyasat Nagar in the old city area. All these localities witnessed water rise to 4 feet. Close to two dozen colonies around LB Nagar too faced a similar fate.

Urban flooding has become a common occurrence these days in India. A number of metro cities in the country including Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi and Bengaluru have suffered from it.

The latest victim of urban flooding is Hyderabad. The city as well Telangana received unusually excessive rainfall October 13-14, 2020, due to a deep depression that developed in the Bay of Bengal. Heavy damage to property, roads and human lives has been reported.

Hyderabad has a long history of existence. It is more than 400 years old. The population of the city has grown exponentially. It is 10 million today, up from 1 million in 1950 and 0.1 million at the beginning of the 19th century.

Hyderabad is located on the banks of the Musi river. The Himayat Sagar and Osman Sagar dams on the river, supply the water to the city.

Hyderabad has spread in all directions in recent years. New roads, buildings and infrastructure have appeared. New housing colonies have been erected.

There is a lot of difference in the design of urban localities built at the beginning of the last century and today. Earlier, people in urban areas usually walked or cycled. The average width of a colony road used to be less than 10 feet.

Later, in the middle of the 20th century, the width of the colony road widened to accommodate three-wheelers or small cars. Then, the size of the cars increased, causing the width of the colony road to increase to 40 feet.

Today, new colonies in metro cities have roads more than 50 feet wide.

The narrow lanes and roads, meanwhile, become ‘rivers’ when heavy rains due to depressions, cyclones and cloud bursts occur.

The city of Hyderabad has a good gradient. Some places are quite elevated while others are close to the Musi. There is a natural system of flow of water from a high elevated area to a lower one.

This is perfectly illustrated through the system of natural lakes in Hyderabad, locally known as ‘Cheruvu’ in Telugu.

For instance, water from the Ramakrishna area Cheruvu in the northwest transfers to Peerzadiguda Cheruvu, which is in the east via Pedda Cheruvu. Pedda in Telugu means ‘Big’. Ironically though, the Cheruvu is now Cinna Cheruvu ie small lake.

I had visited this waterbody in the early 1970s and had seen children swimming in its clean waters. It has shrunk due to encroachment. From Peerzadiguda Cheruvu, the accumulated water goes to the Musi.

With this background, let us define what is urban flooding. The city of Hyderabad doesn’t usually get flooded due to monsoonal rain, which is spread over a long period.

However, depressions and cyclones are packed with rain water and usually last for a few days or even hours. This results in more water falling over an area in a short span of time.

Cloud bursts are a similar example of a heavy downpour occurring in less than 1-2 hours. Thus, depressions, cyclonic rain and cloud bursts can lead to urban flooding, which is becoming a big concern for all metropolitan cities in India.

Cities are growing in size as well as population. The natural path of water from elevated areas to lower ground is being blocked by new offices, markets, colonies, etc.

The rainwater gets diverted to other routes and follows the roads and lanes of colonies. If the width of the colony road is less, it turns into a flooded river and water may enter houses.

The need is to reduce the catchment areas in every colony so that the amount of water available to flow in a particular lane is considerably reduced.

Solutions for Hyderabad

In the short term, the natural path of water drainage from high altitude to a lower one should be traced. These routes have been blocked or encroached due to rapid urbanisation, with the city becoming a patchwork of lanes and by-lanes, resulting in larger catchment areas.

The idea is to reduce the catchment area, resulting in less amount of accumulation of rainwater. The catchment areas can be redesigned by proper segmentation of colonies in the form of columns and rows. At some locations, the existing buildings need to be relocated.

In the long term, an underground drainage system should be constructed to flush rainwater from any place, whether it is at a high or low elevation, till the final place of discharge, like the Musi river in Hyderabad’s case.

Since the long-term solution may be costly and time-consuming, it is advisable to use a combination of both, short-term and long-term solutions.

The above recommendations apply to the city of Hyderabad having many lakes that are interconnected due to its topography and geology. This is not valid for other Indian cities.

Delhi gets flooded during the monsoon and sometimes due to western disturbances and needs a different geological approach. The same is the case with Mumbai, which is a coastal city and hence needs a different approach.

The geology of an area is thus an important factor to mitigate the impact of urban flooding.

A video showed some auto-rickshaws getting washed away in a flooded street. In a rain-related incident, a five-year-old girl died early Sunday in a wall collapse in Mangalhat area , civic officials said. The Met office forecast more rains in parts of the state till October 21. At Hayathnagar here, some local residents, including women, confronted local TRS corporator Tirumal Reddy when he visited some flood affected areas on Sunday, accusing him of neglecting their complaints over encroachment of a drain. They said the blockage of the drain resulted in water entering their houses.Heavy rains early last week had wreaked havoc in parts of the state, including the city, claiming over 50 lives in incidents such as house collapse and drowning and leaving hundreds of houses in low-lying areas under sheets of water. The state capital bore the brunt as a depression had dumped the heaviest rains (nearly 20 cm) since 1916 for October on Tuesday and triggered flash floods.The rains abated since Wednesday with the flood water receding in most parts while the government in a preliminary estimate had pegged the losses at over Rs 5,000 crore.However, since Saturday night, several parts of the city and neighbouring districts again were battered by torrential rains with Saroornagar in adjoining Rangaraddy district recording the maximum of 16.9 cm while Hyderabad Airport 7.2 cm.On Sunday, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) Commissioner D S Lokesh Kumar said they launched steps to restore normalcy in the areas affected by the latest spell and intensified relief works.

Designated as 'Deep Depression BOB 02' by the IMD (India Meteorological Department), it weakened and moved westward over land and triggered heavy rainfall across Telangana.

In Hyderabad, during the day one witnessed the usual waterlogged roads and flooded basements. But soon the situation took a turn for the worse, as one neighbourhood after another went underwater. The city which received an average rainfall of 69.1 cm in a year, had seen parts of it receive 28 cm on this particular day alone.

The Musi, along which the modern city of Hyderabad was established in 1591, was once feared for its torrential waters, especially during the monsoons. The Thugyani Sitambar or the Great Musi Flood of September 1908, is considered an epochal moment in the city’s history. The river’s catchment areas received 98.57 cm rainfall causing the waters to rise over 60 feet. An estimated 15,000 were killed and homages are still offered every year to a tamarind tree which saved the lives of over 150 people who climbed on it to escape the waters.

The Nizam of Hyderabad invited Sir Mokashagundam Visweswaraiah to develop a flood mitigation system for the city. A modern drainage system was developed and two major reservoirs of Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar were built by damming the river and its tributary, Esi. A City Improvement Board was established in 1914 to oversee a planned and phased development of the city.

The system largely worked and the only time Hyderabad had had major flooding was in August 2000, when 46.9 cm of rain caused flooding of as many as 90 localities. However, as heavy rains continued to beat down upon the city for over a week, lakes and drains which have been neglected and encroached upon for decades, could not keep up with the inflows. Overflowing waters from lakes flooded surrounding colonies with a force that brought down walls, overturned parked vehicles of all sizes and carried them afar, and mangled steel shutters of shops. About 37 people died in Hyderabad alone, by drowning, electrocution, and by being buried under a wall collapse.

The Musi’s fury knew no bounds as it crashed through every encroachment that stood in its natural path. The force of the water caused structural damage to the Nayapul bridge and washed away metallic barricades erected on the Chaderghat and Moosarambagh bridges. The river inundated more parts of the city when the gates of the Himayat Sagar lake were lifted after more than a decade.

Water levels in some neighbourhoods reached 12 feet. At Nadeem Colony in Tolichowki, one of the first settlements to report rising waters, boats were deployed to rescue people and move them to safer grounds. As ground floors submerged, residents had to scamper to first or even second floors for safety. Over 37,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas between October 13 and 19 as K. Taraka Rama Rao, Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development, informed the media.

Several localities such as the Al Jubail colony and Uma Narasimha Nagar in Kompally continued to be under several feet of water even after the rains stopped. When the waters receded from areas such as Hafiz Baba Nagar and Al Jubail Colony, they left behind huge mounds of trash and mangled vehicles, and houses covered in mud. Standing crops in several parts of Telangana were also damaged. The state government pegged the total losses to over Rs.9000 crores and has offered Rs.10,000 to every house that the waters had entered.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

On Monday, an order was issued regarding the establishment of the Strategic Nala Development Programme (SNDP) and appointing Dr. C Vasantha, retired chief engineer of Roads and Buildings department, to head the new wing as the Officer on Special Duty (OSD) for a year.

According to the government order, the project wing will study the existing Nala (nullah) or stormwater drainage system across the city and identify critical narrow points, encroachments on its path, and also related issues, and submit reports to take up all works in a mission mode.

As a specialized wing in the GHMC, the state government has decided that the SNDP will work in coordination with other line departments while working under the control of the GHMC commissioner. Based on field requirements, the SNDP is allowed to induct officials from the Irrigation department and other field experts. And the policies, programmes, and activities of this new wing will be subjected to frequent review at a higher level, it said.

Following the floods, the GHMC had plugged the immediate damages to roads, drainage, and nullahs at Rs 670 cr.

A similar special inspection that was taken up by 15 Flood Management Groups on 192 tanks (lakes and ponds) across Greater Hyderabad soon after the floods have called for emergency works to the tune of Rs 9.8 cr and permanent works to the tune of Rs 31.64 cr in these tanks.

The teams were formed to take up precautionary measures to protect the lakes and ponds in Greater Hyderabad and assess the damages or breaches that had occurred due to heavy rains.

While Hyderabad continues its infrastructural development under the rubric of missions like the Smart City mission, it remains ill-equipped to deal with its annual rainfall, let alone extreme rainfall events like the recent floods.

On September 30, in the run up to the civil polls in Hyderabad, the State Minister for Urban Development and IT, K.T. Rama Rao, announced that the government had spent over Rs 67,000 crore over the past five years on various development works throughout the city. The declaration came just a few days before the city was brought to its knees by the devastating floods on October 13. Despite the investment, Hyderabad’s unpreparedness surely calls for a hard look into understanding what happened and how the impact can be mitigated in the future.

The city’s history of responding to disasters such as floods, or even events of heat stress remain reactionary measures which do not last long. When such reactionary measures are part of city planning, where does climate resilience come in? More importantly, what does climate resilience mean for Indian cities? The focus of urban planning has to increasingly take into account the transient nature of the city and its population.

Hyderabad is not alone in facing the repercussions of human-induced climate change. Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai have all experienced damaging levels of flooding. The latter two also contend with a depleting groundwater supply and various cities have been experiencing intolerable heat waves. This, along with Delhi’s out-of-control air pollution, reinforces that this is not a problem unique to Hyderabad, but rampant across India.

The last time the city of Hyderabad faced such intense rainfall was more than a hundred years ago, in 1908. In response, the then ruler of Hyderabad, the Nizam, built the Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar dams, which simultaneously protected the city from flood waters and provided drinking water. The way city planning took shape after the floods set the tone for infrastructural development for Hyderabad, its commons and its resources. Commons such as agricultural lands, rivers, lakes, streams, pasture lands thrived under the Nizam administration. A look back at Hyderabad’s urban development, urbanisation and its flood management policies since those floods hints at why the floods in 2020 were as devastating and what future city planning desperately needs.

The idea of infrastructure development for a metropolitan has, so far, meant the metro, bridges, roads and buildings, which today represents civic infrastructure. However, what is often overlooked are energy, water, spatial, and people’s infrastructures.

What Happened After 1908?

As part of the measures to protect the city from future floods, river banks between the Chaddarghat and the Purana Pul bridge were raised by 30 ft andlined with parks and government buildings – the high court, city college, Osmania Hospital and the Asafiya Library – over the next two decades, by 1931. A systematic forsaking of the commons and the land-use patterns and activities associated with the commons began with its inhabitants gradually moving away from engaging with the Musi river.

The natural and the socio-ecological environment around the Musi began transforming with a sense of modernisation influenced by the British and western views of refurbishing Indian cities, mirroring a trend seen in the rest of the country. In fact, the employment of the famed planner M. Visvesvaraya and the building of the two dams was considered a significant technological milestone back then. However, this process of modern urbanisation was not triggered by the floods, it only accentuated the process. The British built the Secunderabad Club, the Koti Residency, and the Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption, and more of the city’s elites began to move north, closer to the power centre, where earlier elites had already begun to move after the 1908 floods. At the time of the flood, the city covered 26 sq. miles, while the population recorded in 1901 was 4,48,466.

While the Nizam did follow a modernisation-driven plan, in the wake of the 1908 floods, the administration developed several lakes to complement the existing network of irrigation systems and formed a channel of such water bodies. When the Nizam responded to the floods, it wasn’t merely mitigation and reducing the risk from a consecutive flooding event, it was integrated with transforming the water and economic infrastructure of the city, making the Nizam’s vision much more futuristic than visions shaping today’s cities.

While the changes to the water channels by building tanks and dams meant that the city was now well prepared, it is not the entire story. The natural resources within the city, along with the vision of incorporating commons as part of the city’s survival and resilience, were gradually abandoned after the 1908 floods, charting the trajectory to the city’s present vision of modern development.

From Planned Urbanisation to ‘Master Plans’

Although the city of Hyderabad saw very little urban planning since Independence, it saw regulated and planned urban development during the Nizam and the Qutb Shahi eras.

The Nizam set up the City Improvement Board (CIB) in the aftermath of the floods to address housing, sanitation and the urban design issues of the city. Until 1941, the CIB undertook 45 projects that ranged from infrastructure, transportation and slum clearance, to economics. Infrastructure projects focused on water systems, bridges, and city beautification while the economic projects looked at building markets and creating industrial areas. Thus, the CIB addressed the spatial, water, waste, and social infrastructure needs of the city.

In 1948, the CIB and its projects were all dissolved into the Andhra Pradesh Housing Board. Following post-colonial urban growth, the urban built-up area increased exponentially after economic liberalisation in the early-1990s. The urban build-up is also accompanied by a rapidly increasing population. Today, Hyderabad has a population of 70 lakh, with the floating population close to one crore.

The city underwent major changes between 1989 and 2011, promoting the IT sector to replace the traditional manufacturing sector, establishing HITEC City, the expansion of the industrial sector with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology factories, and building the Outer Ring Road (ORR). The city’s sprawl since the 90’s was exacerbated by its master plans and parastatal bodies which were outside the functioning of the city’s municipal corporation. A few provisions of the 1975 Development Plan for the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad and the then state-led world-class city vision, resulted in major road-widening projects between 1995 and 2001. The subsequent master plans of 1994 and 2020 significantly changed the city’s agrarian-focus to making Hyderabad a globally important city. These plans brought in major changes in land-use patterns, where land allocated by the government for agriculture was used for government buildings, cultural shopping centres and IT complexes.

The gradual vanishing of the city’s commons and open spaces was now coupled with rapid urban expansion. The Master Plan for Cyberabad Development Authority Area (CDA), which came into effect in 2001, further hastened the process of replacing the city’s spatial and water infrastructure with civic and business infrastructure. The CDA had autonomous governance that did not come under the jurisdiction of the then Hyderabad Urban Development Authority.

About 40% of the area designated as a Special Economic Zone under the CDA was the catchment zone of the Himayatsagar lake. This happened alongside the Master Plan for the Hyderabad Airport Development Authority, which triggered similar land-use changes in the southern parts of the city. The by-passing of the local civic bodies and creating autonomous, parastatal bodies for governance that looked to the west and created ‘global’ pockets in the city, began with the Industrial Area Local Authority (IALA) which was instrumental in developing the Serilingampally area. Such initiatives in the city set a precedence for local governance which now worked in silos and offered little chance for convergence.

The 2031 Master Plan, a globalised, technically-designed plan, is a three-stage plan for expansion and transformation of the urban-rural fringe. The three stages involve transformation of agricultural land use, changes in occupational structure and the increase of urban land-use growth.

Most of the Qutb Shahi era infrastructure has been hidden within the twenty-first century urban sprawl, and the low-lying areas today are sacrificial sites for the cities’ growth project and its planners, where new infrastructure barely makes its way in. This is clearly unsustainable and calls for a change in the way city planners look at infrastructure – aiding resource-flow monitoring instead of traffic. Resilience needs to take into account the rupture in our imaginaries that not only drives this “global city” planning agenda, but increasingly alienates and marginalises slums and their inhabitants, and push them out of sight.

The City’s Resilience

Various reports have pointed out the city’s inadequate storm water drainage (SWD) system, which reportedly covers less than 30% of the city. The existing storm water drainage network in the city, which covers the major storm drains and is spread over 390 kms, is designed to handle rainfall between 15 – 20 mm per hour. It means that it can handle more than the 290 mm per day average rainfall that the city received during the floods in October.

However, because of issues of silting and deposition of solid waste, networks are clogged and fail to handle the water. Moreover, the minor drains across the rest of the city, which were proposed to be widened to handle 100 mm of rainfall per day, cannot withstand such heavy rainfall. Also, low-lying areas even defy major storm drains sometimes, since the rate of inundation varies with the intensity of the rainfall. While major areas under the GHMC limits received rainfall of above 200 mm, the outskirts – Ghatkesar received 324.8 mm of rainfall followed by 300 mm at Vanasthalipuram and 298 mm at Pedda Amberpet and Hayathnagar – which still run on the over century-old Nizam-era storm water drainage systems which are not equipped to deal with the rampant urbanisation since.

The Kirloskar Committee appointed by the then-united Andhra Pradesh government, which identified the reasons for flooding in the year 2000, noted that there were 13,500 illegal structures built on top of 390 kms of drains. This rampant construction of illegal structures is a direct result of the city planning narrative which has been adopted over the decades, one of global-city civic infrastructure development.

The 2020 Master Plan and CDA Master Plan are examples of how the civic infrastructure has been prioritised over water infrastructure and resilience measures. In fact, the 2020 Master Plan states that the cost of a new and improved drainage system have to be borne by the people living in the area and that ‘there is no way whatsoever to meet these costs.’

The focus has also been unfairly narrowed down to encroachments alone, which is far from a reality. The growth of the city and its unplanned metastasis is the problem, of which illegal encroachment is only a part.

The non-structural measures for flood resilience and preparedness are highly politicised and driven by the state’s vision and market infrastructure, further isolating city planning from its governing bodies and its socio-ecological contexts. The implementations of the Master Plans and the nature of their diverting trajectories are a testament to how the city has delineated itself from actively planning to work towards resilient measures. Today, it is forced to react to each flooding event by picking up the pieces year after year. The vision of a ‘global city’ has compromised the ability of Hyderabad to deal with extreme weather events like floods.

However, given the climate-induced extreme weather events, the question arises: should the city prepare for flooding that might occur even once in 20 years if not in a hundred years? Somewhere between preparing for urban floods every year and the deadly once-in-a-century extreme weather event, our systems of resilience need to be developed. Amid this trajectory, the city’s history of responding to disasters such as floods or even events of heat stress remains reactionary, with measures that have no lasting effect.

Unmapping resilience

We must examine what got us into this fix, and must re-examine the top-down approach of implementing a global vision for cities, which doesn’t often take into account local experiences. This approach is not just unique to Hyderabad, but is imitated across the country. This narrow global vision has brought us here. The most aggressive impacts of climate-change influenced disasters are only beginning to be felt now, in the form of floods and deadly heat waves.

In this continuing trend of climate impact, where such extreme weather events are predicted to increase in frequency, we are looking at future cities that will become un-liveable. Today’s city and its infrastructure is made of reinforced concrete structures that are short-lived and brittle, making a city’s foundation delicate by itself. And if the city’s planning allows it to flood, in addition to the impending extreme weather events, we can expect a much more decreased life expectancy for cities.

Resilience doesn’t and shouldn’t begin with extreme events – even as they are triggered by such events – it should be an increment of capacity building for existing infrastructure. The political economy of resilience needs to be exposed, where extreme weather events like heat stress need to adopt a lens of social vulnerability, one that looks for solutions beyond technological or infrastructural quick-fixes.

For instance, heat stress, when viewed through an infrastructural lens, accommodates the elite who can bypass it with cooling infrastructures, similar to how the elites during the Nizam were able to move away from the flood-prone banks of the Musi. A political economy of resilience considers the capabilities of communities that are the most vulnerable to face and adapt to such extreme events. We need to increasingly weave in local livelihoods, intersectional and disproportionate impacts of yearly weather on different communities within the city, to come up with a more robust plan for the city’s resilience.

There are avenues for the state to adopt such a vision into city planning. For instance, the Government of India has initiated the program called Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). It focuses on the provision of water supply, sewerage, storm water drains, green spaces and public transport in 500 cities in India. The 2019 Manual on Storm Drainage defines the norms and rules for the design of sustainable drainage systems.

The first step, however, would be for the state government to revise its 2031 Master Plan to prioritise protection and active rejuvenation of the urban commons, such farm and scrub lands, that act as natural sponges for absorbing the rain water. This would essentially mean converging and integrating the many schemes and missions that are simultaneously being implemented in the city – be it the Smart Cities Mission or AMRUT or the National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM) – they need to speak with each other, and more importantly, engage with the civic bodies in the cities rather than work autonomously, creating yet another parastatal body.

While the smart city missions have been made to incorporate various infrastructure changes in the city, not all of them necessarily trickle down to accommodating the needs of the urban working class, its slum dwellers, the migrants and the informal workers in terms of addressing their needs for housing, transport and livelihoods, especially those that are traditionally embedded with the commons, and have been replaced over the decades for various development projects. Such a convergence would mean integrating and mapping intersections that invariably affect each other, but it would also mean effectively managing the financing of these missions, which currently derive their funds through multiple complex sources, hindering their implementation.

In addition to ensuring that these missions and schemes don’t compete with each other for space and jurisdiction, they should also ensure that they increasingly take into account the voices of the people who have been marginalised and displaced over the decades to make space for private infrastructure and special economic zones, such as in Mumbai and Gujarat. The reiteration of the existing socio-economic inequalities and hierarchies through the smart cities missions needs to be combated. To address these concerns, there is a need for rejecting a global-vision driven solution for all cities together under the rubric of a centralised mission. There is a need for such missions be decentralised and to speak to each other to integrate technical knowledge with traditional understanding of land-use patterns.

Integrating the city’s commons into its fold of resilience measures requires an understanding of what was historically forgotten, like the abandonment of living with the Musi and its revival. This can happen through ‘unmapping’ the city and identifying its commons and evolving the current day urban planning practices to be make space for more spatial and social infrastructure within the city.

This is not the first time the city has faced severe deluge, however. In August 2000 also, the city had been flooded, after which the Geological Survey of India carried out studies to understand what led to the phenomenon. In its report on the floods, the GSI listed the causes for the flood and recommendations for future. Here’s what it said.

Hyderabad floods: Causes for 2000 deluge

The GSI report listed the following causes for flooding:

Some residential areas, like in Nallakunta, have been raised by blocking Musi River’s prominent tributary. This leads to such residential properties being inundated.

The report also noted that several water tanks had been converted into residential areas, like converting the Masab Tank into a densely populated area. Such conversions have caused active streams of River Musi on the downstream sides to be completely blocked. Moreover, such colonies have also led to the tampering of the natural path of surface drainage and as a result, get flooded if rainfall occurs for five to six consecutive hours.

In the Langar Hauz residential area, the northern and northeastern parts are in low-lying areas having slopes. Moreover, these areas also have active streams running in the middle, causing them to get flooded.

Some colonies with a lot of population, like in Ashok Nagar and Gandhi Nagar, are located on Hussain Sagar tank’s downstream side. Consequently, during the floods, water emerging out is blocked by the colonies and these residential areas get flooded instead.

The GSI said that the 2000 floods helped in bringing into limelight the issues in the urban planning of the city.

""Hyderabad city has contributed Rs 7 lakh crore to the state exchequer in the past seven years but the city's infrastructure has been completely debilitated. Where has all that money gone? People are completely devastated and do not even have essential commodities and food to eat,"" Congress spokesperson Dasoju Sravan said.

The Congress spokesperson added: ""Why is CM KCR still not reviewing the relief measures or announcing compensation? What is Municipal Minister KTR doing? Why is he fearing to visit the flood areas without security and oversee relief measures?""

The opposition party also pointed out that it was not the first time Hyderabad has received heavy rains, triggering a flood.

""Though the meteorological department warned of heavy rains, the government did not take any preventive steps or set up a control room to monitor the situation. While the city was being washed away, CM KCR reviewed the 'Haritha Haram' on Wednesday, and only after extensive devastation, CM held a review on rains on Thursday afternoon,"" the Congress leader alleged.

Dasoju Sravan also claimed that Chief Minister KCR became active about the flood-hit Hyderabad only after President Ram Nath Kovind and PM Narendra Modi enquired about the situation.

Dasoju Sravan also hit out at Municipal Affairs Minister KT Rama Rao.

""He [KT Rama Rao] always makes tall claims about Hyderabad's development which was nowhere seen in relief operations. Only after the damage was done, he visited selected areas, that too, flanked by the DGP under tight security. The TRS government has turned Hyderabad, which is considered the 'most livable city', into a dreaded city,"" Dasoju Sravan said.

Alleging corruption after heavy rains wreaked havoc in Hyderabad, Congress demanded to know what happened to the crores of the fund that KTR claimed was spend on Hyderabad's development.

""Municipal Affairs Minister KTR claims that Rs 67,000 crore was spent on Hyderabad's development. Where has all that money gone? Did that money go into the pockets of KTR?""

This article gives the low-down on disaster management funds and fact-checks the claim made in the post.

The archived version of the post can be found here.

Claim: Rs. 10,000 flood relief given recently to the flood victims in Hyderabad by the State Government is actually financed from the Rs. 550 crores flood aid released by the Central Government. Fact: The Central Government has released Rs. 448 crores as part of its share of SDRMF to Telangana. This is a statutory obligation upon the Central Government, and it releases funds to every state irrespective of a disaster. However, the 2nd instalment of this fund is released to only a few states and Telangana is one among these few states. Apart from this, no additional assistance has been released to the state related to the recent floods. However, a central team has visited the flood-hit Hyderabad to assess the loss. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING.

Government of India has enacted the Disaster Management Act in 2005 which envisaged the creation of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), headed by the Prime Minister and State Disaster Management Authorities (SDMA) headed by respective Chief Ministers in view of spearheading and implementing a holistic and integrated approach to disaster management in India.

State Disaster Response Fund:

Disaster Management Act entails the creation of a State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) under Section 48 (1)(a) which acts as the primary fund available at State governments disposal at the time of disasters. The Central government contributes 75% towards the SDRF for general category states and UTs and 90% for special category states/UTs which includes northeastern and Himalayan States.

The Finance Commission in its periodic reports make recommendations regarding the quantum of SDRF for each state. However the central government is not obliged to implement the recommendations. For example, the fourteenth finance commission has recommended that Union and State Governments contribute to the SDRF corpus in the ratio of 90:10 for all the states but this was not implemented as the Union Government decided to continue with the already existing 75:25 sharing pattern.

Generally, the Union Government would release the funds in two equal instalments and likewise, the state governments shall also transfer their contribution to the SDRF in two installments. The central government is obliged to release these funds to SDRFs irrespective of the occurrence of disasters. Also, the State Governments are entitled to use up to 10% of the funds available in SDRF to provide immediate relief to the victims during the time of local disasters which are not notified under the category of disasters by the Ministry of Home Affairs provided such disasters are notified by the State Governments.

15th Finance Commission Recommendations

Since the present disaster management system focuses too much on disaster response rather than risk mitigation, preparedness etc., the 15th Finance Commission has recommended to set up Mitigation funds at both National and State level in the form of National and State Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF & SDMF) as stipulated in the Disaster Management Act. Mitigation funds shall be used for risk aversion at the community level whereas the response funds shall be used for reconstruction and recovery. In order to achieve this, the commission has recommended that allocation of the funds shall be in the ratio of 80:20 for SDRF and SDMF. And within the 80% allocation of SDRF, 40% is allocated for Response & Relief, 30% for Recovery & Reconstruction and 10% for Preparedness & Capacity Building. Further, the commission has recommended an outlay of Rs. 28,983 crores for SDRMF for the year 2020-2021 out of which Centers share is Rs. 22,184 crores.

Release of Funds in the time of COVID-19

Central Government has notified COVID-19 as a disaster and permitted the State Governments to utilize the SDRF funds in dealing with the pandemic. And in the view of the pandemic, the central government has decided to extend the time period of existing guidelines recommended by the 14th Finance Commission for a period of one year. Further, these guidelines are subject to recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission regarding the funding windows of SDRF and SDMF. Also, the Central Government has released its share of 1st instalment of Rs. 11,092 crores in advance out of which Telangana has received Rs. 224.50 crores. And as of 03 November 2020, the Central Government has released the 2nd instalment of its share in advance for few states and Telangana is one among these states and it received Rs. 449 crores.

In addition to these statutory transfers, during the time of disasters of severe nature, SDRFs are supplemented through National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) provided there are no adequate funds with SDRF. Usually, a Inter Ministerial Central Team (ICTM) would visit the disaster affected state and assess the severity and magnitude of loss and submit its report to the Central Government based on which Centre would release additional funds through NDRF.

According to a press release dated 13 November 2020 by the Home Ministry, a High-Level Committee under the chairmanship of Union Home Minister has approved additional central assistance under NDRF to six states (West Bengal, Odisha, Maharashtra, Karnataka, MP and Sikkim) which were affected by disasters earlier this year. Telangana did not feature among these states. It is possible that such additional assistance may be released to Telangana in the coming months.

Even back in 2019, when Bihar and Karnataka were affected with floods, the Centre has provided additional financial assistance of Rs. 1200 crores to Karnataka and the Central Government has approved for advance release of funds for Bihar. Similarly, additional assistance was given to West Bengal after an Inter-Ministerial Central Team assessed of loss caused due to the floods in 2017.

Recently, a five-member central team has visited Hyderabad on 22 October 2020 to assess the magnitude of loss occurred due to heavy rains and recent flash floods. Telangana government has projected an estimated loss of Rs. 9,400 crores due to the floods which wreaked havoc in the entire state. Out of the total loss projected by the Telangana Government, the loss estimated in GHMC was Rs. 567 crores. The central government will take a call regarding the release of additional assistance based on the report submitted by the Central team. As on date, no additional funds have been released.

In a nutshell, Contrary to the claim made in the post, the Central Government has released Rs. 449 crores to Telangana as part of its share of SDRMF which is a statutory obligation and is not related to the additional assistance for floods. As on date, no additional assistance is provided by the Central Government to Telangana regarding the recent Hyderabad floods.",discussion,Hyderabad floods,"Hyderabad, Telangana, India",2020-10-17,2020-10-20,Hyderabad,100 mm,"Rs. 9,400 crores",10,Havoc wreaked in the entire state,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The study was reportedly undertaken to analyse the reasons behind the massive flooding and waterlogging in the city due to the mid-October heavy rains.

According to the findings of the Irrigation and CAD department officials, who studied 192 lakes and waterbodies in Hyderabad, encroachments are spread across lakes -- Saroornagar lake, Gurram Cheruvu, Burhankhan Cheruvu, Durgam Cheruvu, Chandam Cheruvu, Saki Cheruvu, Nayanammakunta, Tegalsagar Cheruvu, Rayasamudram Cheruvu, Tegal Sagar, Timmakka Cheruvu and water bodies in Uppal, Kapra, Hayathnagar and Moosapet. The encroachments included large real estate ventures and public institutions.

Experts have pointed fingers at the several illegal encroachments as the main reason for flooding in Hyderabad and surrounding areas leading to the death of 33 people. The torrential rainfall on October 13-14 led to overflowing of River Musi in the city submerging low-lying areas.

According to a technical report prepared by the Society for Participatory Development, the water spread area of the main water bodies of Mir Alam, Umda Sagar and Himayat Sagar was reduced from 2199.47 hectares in 1978 to 1361.8 hectares in 2017.

According to Musi Riverfront Development Corporation Ltd (MRDCL), there are nearly 6,350 encroachments within the Musi river boundary and its buffer zone.

Further, a central government team has pegged the damage across Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation at Rs 567 crore. According to the corporation’s data, dozens of colonies in Hyderabad were waterlogged for several days.

Recommendations for Flood Prevention Ignored

The Kirloskar Consultants panel had submitted a report on the reasons for massive flooding in Hyderabad in 2000, which devastated numerous colonies and affected thousands of people.

The panel studied 72 drainage sewers and 18 water bodies including Hussain Sagar, Himayatsagar, Osman Sagar and Mir Alam Tank among others and found that large scale encroachment of lakes, improper drainage system, indiscriminate dumping of waste into water bodies were some of the key reasons that caused flooding in the city.

To stop the floods, the panel recommended rejuvenation of river Musi, development of green zones on both sides of drains, widening of drains, destruction of illegal encroachments in lakes and rejuvenation of canals connecting water bodies, among others.

However, the recommendations remain unimplemented till this date. In 2017, municipal administration minister K T Rama Rao reportedly called the recommendations impractical. Replying to a question in the Assembly, the minister said that if the Kirloskar Consultants report was to be implemented, about 28,800 properties would have to be demolished, paying around Rs 12,000 crore as compensation.

The Telangana Rashtra Samithi-led government has reportedly given financial assistance of Rs 10,000 for flood-related property damage to each of over 4.75 lakh families in and around GHMC; this amounts to Rs 475 crore.",flood,Hyderabad floods,"Hyderabad, Telangana",2019-10-13,2019-10-14,"['Hyderabad', 'surrounding areas']","['200 mm, 250 mm']",['567 crore'],['33'],"['dozens of colonies in Hyderabad were waterlogged for several days', 'recommendations for flood prevention ignored']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The Great Musi Floods of 1908 that impacted most of Hyderabad was caused by an unprecedented downpour on September 28 that year and each year September has been the time for caution.

This year, however, it is October that saw an extreme weather event that will be etched in the memories of the people. Sudden spells of heavy downpour, cloud bursts and flash floods over a week and especially on the intervening night of October 13 and October 14, exposed the fragile and inefficient urban infrastructure of the capital of Telangana.

Some experts claim that it is a clear case of the impact of climate change causing extreme weather events. Others point out that it is an example of bad planning, the encroachment of lakes and poor urban infrastructure and preparedness. Hyderabad lost 33 lives, nearly 40,000 families got badly impacted and suffered a property loss of Rs 670 crores as per official estimates.

Hyderabad of October, Chennai of December 2015 and Mumbai of July 2005 are definite cases of extreme events. They are wake up calls for urban planners to firm up strategies and implement measures to minimise the damages of such events, whose occurrence could only increase in future, say experts.

Annual average fatalities in India due to climate hazards are about 3660, which is the second highest in the world. The vulnerability of southern cities to urban flooding seems higher. Extreme rainfall events occurred in Hyderabad in 2016, 2010 and 2000. Kerala was swamped by floods in 2018 and Chennai battered in 2015.

A record rainfall

According to a recent study by the Centre for Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences of the University of Hyderabad, increasing urbanisation in Telangana and Tamil Nadu is likely to enhance the rainfall during heavy rainfall events by 20% to 25%. The study by Karumuri Ashok and Boyaj of UoH was done in collaboration with Ibrahim Hoteit and Hari Prasad Dasari of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia.

The study used land use land cover imagery from the Indian Space Research Organisation and conducted a dozen simulated, heavy rainfall events over the three southern states. The changes in land use land cover led to higher surface temperatures and a deeper and moist boundary layer. This, in turn, caused a relatively higher convective available potential energy and, consequently, heavier rainfall. The precipitation levels during heavy rainfall events have significantly increased from 2000 to 2017. Their findings were reported in the Quarterly Journal of Royal Meteorological Society on May 18.

Incidentally, Hyderabad celebrated its 429th foundation day on October 7 and October 8. Even before the celebrations, subdued due to the pandemic, dark, rain-bearing clouds converged over the city because of a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal. Consequently, on October 13 and October 14, the tri-city – Hyderabad, Secunderabad and Cyberabad – an extent of 650 sq km, got battered with all-time record rainfall of 29.8 cms in 24 hours. The August 2000 downpour was recorded at 24 cm. For the record, the single-day highest rainfall record in the state of Telangana is 35.5 cms in October 1983 in Nizamabad.

“The unusually heavy rainfall was due to two reasons,” said B Raja Rao, of India Meteorological Department, Hyderabad. “The deep depression in the Bay of Bengal that moved onto the land in Hyderabad. The second was the rain-bearing clouds of the withdrawing Southwest monsoon also pouring out.”

People in large parts of Hyderabad woke up to water everywhere and many lives thrown out of gear. Several low lying localities were deluged in the water from rains and overflowing water bodies.

The city along a river

Hyderabad was built along the river Musi, one of the tributaries of river Krishna. The city was spread over 55 sq km to 60 sq km during the 1908 floods. Learning lessons from the natural disaster, the Nizam sought the help of the renowned engineer Sir Mokhshagundem Visweswarayya for long term flood protection. He designed an underground drainage system, two balancing reservoirs, Himayathsagar and Osmansagar and a sewage treatment plant. The Hussainsagar, which links the twin cities too came up around that time.

Post Independence, with its multiple advantages, Hyderabad grew rapidly as the home for public sector organisations, emerged as the place for bulk pharmaceutical drugs and home to many national research institutes as well. Post economic liberalisation in the 1990s, the neo rich, farmer turned industrial entrepreneurs from coastal Andhra Pradesh, shored up city’s land as a huge, desirable asset, propelling a real estate boom. The inflow of foreign direct investment and coming in of global IT majors such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, Infosys and e-commerce giants such as Amazon, Walmart to IKEA have transformed Hyderabad.

Consequently, in 2020, the sprawling metropolis administered by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation is teeming with close to 10 million people. In contrast, the number of water bodies is down to just 190 from over 2,500 in 1970. Even this number is contested by environmental groups.

“Both, the ‘elected’ (MPs, MLAs, Corporators etc) and ‘selected’ (bureaucrats, revenue officials, municipal corporation) are responsible for a situation wherein, instead of the rainwater flowing into the river, it is rushing into homes”, alleged Lubna Sarwat, who championed Save Our Urban Lakes, a citizen’s initiative to save the lakes of Hyderabad.

In this rapid urbanisation, greed and lack of perspective growth plans, lands in river beds have been grabbed in the name of religious buildings and scores of colonies and apartment complexes have been built by all influential sections from politicians to real estate developers and lawmakers to industrial leaders, she alleged.

Need for a plan

The State Minister for Urban Development and IT, KT Rama Rao, had announced days before the flooding that the TRS Govt had spent Rs 67,500 crores on the development of urban infrastructure to prepare Hyderabad to emerge as a global city since 2015.

The government had firmed up a Musi River Front Project too. Its dreams of realising the expansion of the metropolis through the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority, which extends to 7,500 sq kms (size of Goa) call for dramatic and long term reforms in land use, building construction and infrastructure.

“With the Krishna and Godavari river basins too coming into the picture with water supply being brought to Hyderabad from long distances through pipelines, there is an urgent need to have an expert commission to devise land use plans, drainage and sewage systems and disaster mitigation,” said Ananth Mariganti, from the Hyderabad Urban Labs.

“Hyderabad and even Telangana state do not have a disaster management plans,” said Marri Shashidhar Reddy, former vice chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority. “They are not fully utilising the doppler radar, which can give advance and precise warnings. The focus is on disaster response, even while allowing unplanned growth.”

A former MLA, Reddy suggests annual desilting of storm drains, utilisation of weather data and an overall Master Plan to make Hyderabad ready to face disasters in the long run. With nearly 50% of revenues of the state and huge presence of industry, the economic loss of extreme events can be disastrous, he warned.

There is a need for exploring the concept of climate proofing cities, said V Srinivasa Chary of the Centre for Urban Governance and Infrastructure Development, Environment & Energy at the Administrative Staff College of India. In addition to disaster management, cities too require a certain amount of resilience built in. Hyderabad is a fit case to identify “hot spots” for flooding, design materials and systems that will withstand such events.

Localities in and around Malakpet, Santoshnagar, Chandrayangutta, Charminar, Falaknuma, and Rajendra Nagar in the Charminar zone had reported severe waterlogging and damage to property.

Gurram Cheruvu and Palle Cheruvu, in Chandrayangutta and Rajendranagar, respectively, were the two lakes that overflowed submerging several colonies in the vicinity after a breach of the bund.

So far, the civic body has identified 9163 garbage heaps piled up across these zones. Some of the worst flood-affected localities like Hafeez Baba Nagar, Al-Jubail colony, and other colonies around Gurram Cheruvu in Balapur, Palle Cheruvu in Bandlaguda, Appa Cheruvu in Rajendranagar have all generated tonnes of garbage waste.

Speaking to indianexpress.com, the GHMC’s additional commissioner (Sanitation) P S Rahul Raj said over 1400-strong staff are on the ground tasked with the ongoing special sanitation drive.

“So far we have covered 80 to 90 percent colonies. But there are many low-lying areas with no sufficient drainage. In those areas, we need to pump out the water first and then take up sludge removal works. In another two days, we expect to cover all colonies,” said the official.

“Some of the colonies are inaccessible to our machinery and vehicles due to narrow lanes. If it does not rain further, we can finish in another two days. The total waste generated will be more than 20,000 tonne.”

However, he feels the removal of sludge, garbage and other household stuff damaged in the floods will be an ongoing exercise for some time. “Many people who left their homes for safer places will return home. Whatever is damaged and unusable will be thrown on the roads. So we are expecting more waste.”

While the amount of waste generated post-floods is unprecedented and unexpected, the GHMC is fully capable of processing and disposing of the same, said the additional commissioner.

“The waste we have is much more than what we expected. We are getting mixed waste, from garbage, sludge, and old beds and furniture, etc. We have our garbage processing plant and construction and demolition(C&D) waste processing plants. The collection, shifting, and processing works are going on day and night,” he said.

The Corporation has also been at the receiving end of criticism over the dumping of C&D waste as well as garbage by the side of several road stretches. He said the priority is the removal of waste from colonies.

“At some places, instead of doing full trips to transfer stations and wasting time on transport, our people are dumping waste near to roads. There is a need to clear the garbage and sludge from colonies, and that is our priority. This helps to ease queueing at transfer stations as well,” he added. “Also, C&D waste needs to be separated.”

The debris from demolition is being shifted to Jeedimetla and Fathullaguda C&D debris processing plants, and other wastes are shifted to the municipal dump yard at Jawaharnagar.

This is an important question to ask in the wake of the floods in Hyderabad, which have claimed over 70 lives and caused significant losses to property. It is telling that the deluge coincided with a study by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction that found that India is the second-worst flood-affected nation in Asia which, in turn, accounted for 41 per cent of floods around the world. The changing climate is aggravating the risk; 79 per cent of disasters between 1970 and 2019 were related to water and weather hazards caused by climate change. The vagaries of climate cannot be controlled; neither does the solution lie in only strengthening existing disaster response systems. The focus must be widened to modernize urban planning. This is especially important in the case of India where more people are likely to inhabit cities than rural areas by 2050.

Unsurprisingly, Indian cities — Hyderabad is one example — suffer from flaws in urban design and drainage irrespective of their topographical diversity. This is because urban planning and management have a long history of myopia and lackadaisical administrative attitudes. The consequences of this apathy are telling. Mumbai, Chennai and Srinagar, as well as cities in Kerala and Uttarakhand, have been wrecked by floods in recent years. Chaotic urban development, primitive drainage facilities, creaking infrastructure, population pressure and unabated encroachments upon natural drainage systems — Calcutta’s disappearing wetlands are an example — have exacerbated the problems. There is irrefutable evidence of negligence. In the case of Hyderabad, several reports and recommendations filed since the devastating floods in 2000 are lying unimplemented; a city development plan for Srinagar in 2017 chose to ignore the lessons from the floods only three years prior to that. This wilful disregard for public safety can only be attributed to a culture of impunity for the administration. The cost of the absence of accountability is being borne by cities and the people who inhabit them.",issue,Hyderabad floods,"Hyderabad, Telangana, India","October 13, 2020","October 16, 2020",Hyderabad city and its suburbs,100 mm in 24 hours,Rs. 100 crore,70,"Thousands of people displaced, loss of property, disruption of transportation and communication",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Nature is not elected government. Pandering to public demand is not its mandate, as could be seen from the repeated spells of urban wrecking which have become an expected phenomenon every now and then. Fall in line with utmost speed or perish, is the warning note being left behind every so often, but measures in that direction fall woefully short of the desired result.

Several reports and recommendations since the devastating floods in 2000 are lying unimplemented, and projects taken up by the government towards this direction are moving at snail’s pace, but the encroachment of water bodies and stormwater drains with impunity is proceeding at alarming pace. Activists point to the areas where very recent encroachments have obstructed the water flow, which led to inundation during the latest spate of floods.

“Between 2014, and 2020, encroachments have been made on lake beds at extraordinary pace. Gurram Cheruvu, Sunnam Cheruvu, Palle Cheruvu, APPA Cheruvu… you name it. Several areas are under water, and the government is doing precious little to salvage the situation. I have made some 200 representations to the government over various violations, but received no response to even one,” fumes activist and Telangana State General Secretary of Socialist Party (India) Lubna Sarwat.

M. Srinivas, city secretary of CPI(M), notes that APPA Cheruvu in Gaganpahad has been reduced to four acres from its original spread of 14 acres. “The development has been very recent. The area is occupied by industries and commercial establishments,” he says. Same is the fate of Palle Cheruvu in Mailardevpally and Gurram Cheruvu near Chandrayangutta.

Strangely, the APPA Cheruvu, which was the reason behind the flooding of Hyderabad-Bengaluru highway, is not even notified by the HMDA despite its discovery way back in 2014 by NGO Save Our Urban Lakes. Google’s historic imagery shows that the lake was encroached only recently between 2018 and 2020.

The Lake Protection Committee under HMDA has so far identified a total of 3,132 lakes in its purview, but issued preliminary notification for only about 2,000 of them. Final notification has been issued only for 224.

Ms.Sarwat claims that even in the notified lakes, the authorities have reduced the FTL limits to suit the fancies of a few influential encroachers, and condoned illegal constructions inside the limits. For instance, an FTL stone of the Saroornagar lake which has inundated area up to Dilsukhnagar, is found to be in the Singareni Officers’ Colony!

Besides encroachment of the full tank level (FTL) of lakes, the hydrological chain links — water channels connecting one lake with the other, and finally to Musi river — too have been tampered with and occupied, leading to calamitous consequences when it rains copiously. Town Planning is hardly a matter paid heed to, and indiscriminate permissions for layouts and illegal layouts have wrecked the natural topography of several areas.

Anant Maringanti, another climate activist and founder-executive director of Hyderabad Urban Labs, says, the Town Planning wing lacks teeth in Hyderabad, when compared to those in cities such as Chennai, Mumbai and Kolkata. “The planning body here has no power at all. It has no money, no capacity to do anything. It doesn’t have manpower, nor regulatory authority,” he says.

Urban planners who should obtain information about the significance of any area’s natural terrain and the land use from the Revenue department, actually get only the information about cadastral survey of properties. Mr. Maringanti suggests establishment of a Land Commission through HMDA, which will pore deeply over the current status, and arrive at long lasting solutions for turning the urban agglomeration into a ‘sponge city’.",issue,Hyderabad Floods 2020,"Hyderabad, Telangana, India","October 17, 2020","October 19, 2020","['Gaganpahad', 'Mailardevpally', 'Chandrayangutta']","['100 mm, 150 mm, 200 mm']","['$100 million', '$200 million', '$300 million']","['10, 20, 30']","['Thousands of people displaced', 'Infrastructure damaged', 'Businesses closed']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

In last week’s sudden and unprecedented rains that flooded several low-lying areas of Hyderabad, the 32-year-old haplessly watched his car being swept away from outside his home by the strong currents of gushing water.

Kaleshwar, who used to be a driver for IT companies in the city, had been reeling under the coronavirus lockdown, lack of earning, and now the flash floods, according to him, just dealt him the last blow. Along with the house, the water snatched away his livelihood, too. In the absence of insurance for vehicles damaged in natural disasters, he is among several cab drivers in need for financial assistance from the government to jumpstart his life.

A driver since 2007, it was only after his marriage in 2018 that Kaleshjwar decided to buy a vehicle. Between April and August this year, his 2019-model Mahindra Xylo had remained parked outside his house.

“Since most people now work from home, we do not have many trips. I was hardly getting four to five private trips a month before last week’s floods. Since the six months moratorium lifted in August, I have not paid the monthly EMI of Rs 24,000. And now they have doubled the interest, too,” he says.

Kaleshwar, who lives with his aged parents, wife, and younger brother, says he would earn Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 after 20-22 days of work every month. “Now, we are struggling to meet my father’s monthly medical expenses. Who had thought coronavirus and floods would turn our lives upside down?”

After the floodwaters receded from the neighbourhood, the car is now at a mechanic’s shed. “I have borrowed Rs 1 lakh at three per cent for repairs. And I don’t even know how I will pay up in 3 months. There is no insurance for damage to vehicles in floods. Any help from the government is our last hope,” he says.

Rudra Chakrapani had gone to the Tirupati temple to pray for a new beginning when he heard from his family of waters submerging his house and their Toyota Innova. Forty-eight-year-old Chakrapani, a driver since 1998, now makes a daily visit to their double-bedroom house in Pragathi Nagar of Medipally on the city outskirts to check if anything remained of it.

“Not once, but twice was our house submerged in a matter of days. The water from Chengicherla lake rose to 8 feet in just 15 minutes. We have lost everything. The thought of having to start from scratch is killing me,” says Chakrapani.

Driving the car on outstation trips, Chakrapani used to earn between Rs 25,000 and Rs 30,000 a month after other expenses. Since lockdown, the family has been struggling to make ends meet.

His wife says: “We don’t even know how to continue my children’s education. We have not paid our house rent for six months. We do not even know when we could even go back to our house.”

The car left in a garage, and Chakrapani, along with family, now stays at his in-laws in Boduppal.

Following the flash floods, Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao pegged the total losses in floods at Rs 5,000 crore. The CM then announced financial assistance of Rs 10,000 as immediate relief to each household affected by floods. The state would give Rs 1 lakh to families whose houses were fully damaged. Those houses partially damaged would be given Rs 50,000, as per the CM’s announcement.

When it poured 32.4 cm in Ghatkesar on October 13, the city received an average rainfall of 17 cm in less than 24 hours. Several localities, especially around the old city submerged. Disturbing scenes of vehicles washed away emerged from colonies like Hafeez Baba Nagar, Al Jubail colony, Omer colony, Balapur, and LB Nagar.

Shaik Salauddin, the chairman of Telangana Taxi and Drivers’ Joint Action Committee, points out that repairs to flood-affected cars would cost anything between Rs 30,000 and Rs 2 lakh. “As of now, 300 cab drivers have approached me. There should be 1,000 to 1,500 cabs and taxis damaged and over 4,000 contract vehicles like autorickshaws, goods carriers, and DCM vans that have been damaged in the floods,” says Salauddin.

As the government has already announced flood relief, Salauddin is seeking assistance of Rs 50,000 for cabs with minor damages, Rs 1 lakh for vehicles with major damages, and replacement for vehicles fully damaged.

Mohammed Abdul Quddus Qureshi’s body was found at the Nagole sewage treatment plant along the Musi river, 13 km from his home in Alinagar, even as the steady downpour in Hyderabad continued. His decaying body had floated across three police commissionerate jurisdictions before being fished out. He was laid to rest in a cemetery in Chanchalguda, a neighbourhood in the Old City, near the fresh graves of four of his family members. They were also swept away by the waters of the overflowing Palle Cheruvu lake, part of the Umda Sagar lake basin. Of the nine members of the family who were swept away in the deluge of October 13, only one, Mohammed Abdul Taher Qureshi, survived ; three remain missing. The family’s loss accounts for a chunk of the 33 deaths recorded in Hyderabad.

Taher Qureshi was trying to move the eight members of the single-storey house across the rising waters to safety in his brother’s three-storey building. But the torrent was so strong that it was as if the chabutra , on which they were standing, dissolved in it like salt.

“I heard a wall collapse and in no time, water came in with full force onto the road and consumed the ground floor of the building. I buried two grandchildren and two daughters-in-law. My brother’s body, which was found in Nagole, had decomposed. The bodies of three others have still not been found,” says Abdul, his voice quivering.

A short distance from Alinagar, along National Highway 44, the floodwater from the Appa Cheruvu lake close by, devoured siblings Tanima and Amer, and a cousin, Taher. Their bodies were found a day later. The body of Ayaan, an eight-year-old boy, was also retrieved . The family of four along with their cousin were at home when the water swirled over the wall, sweeping away the house and its inhabitants.

In a separate incident, also on NH 44, Moaawia Youssef, a Sudanese student, who was on his way to the airport along with his cab driver, was last seen on October 14. While the cab driver was eventually traced, the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport Police confirmed that the National Disaster Response Force teams have thus far been unsuccessful in tracing the student.

Unprecedented flooding

The downpour had more devastation in store, and the restive Gurram Cheruvu lake, also part of the Umda Sagar lake basin , served as its vassal. On October 18, its bund that serves as a road connecting Barkas (a corruption of the word ‘barracks’) to Balapur succumbed to water pressure. What followed was an unprecedented flooding of neighbourhoods south of the bund.

Ravi, a caretaker of a dairy farm, recalls the roar with which the water broke the bund. “Around 1 a.m., it rose up to 12 feet, broke our walls and took away cash and furniture. I rushed to save my mother. It is a miracle that we — our four buffaloes, 15 sheep and four horses — are safe. The water then went towards Hafiz Baba Nagar,” he says.

Editorial | Dealing with a deluge: On Hyderabad floods

The scenes from Hafiz Baba Nagar are telling of the loss and devastation. Dozens here are left with nothing but the damp clothes on their backs. “The water smashed the wall of my house, and portions of the roof collapsed. The washing machine, fridge, and our clothes were all swept away. I will have to rebuild my life from scratch,” says Mohammed Salman, an optical fibre cable trencher, and the owner of a home in B Block.

On October 14, after night-long rain, the daily rainfall recorded at the weather monitoring station of the India Meteorological Department at Begumpet was 19.2 cm. It was the second highest in the recorded history of rainfall in a single day at this station since 1891. The water drowned the roads and inundated homes worth crores of rupees in upmarket localities such as Manikonda, Gachibowli, Rajendranagar and Madhapur on the western part of the city, the hub of the IT industry.

On the other hand, data from the automatic weather stations, installed by the Telangana State Development Planning Society, showed the highest for the day at 33 cm, recorded at the Singapore Township in Pocharam, in the eastern part of the city. A week later, the Irrigation Department Principal Secretary, Rajat Kumar, noted that 185 lakes overflowed on account of the rains . Of these, Appa Cheruvu, Palle Cheruvu and Gurram Cheruvu were described as those that breached.

The sisterhood of lakes

In Telangana’s natural terrain, lakes exist in sororities. The State’s undulating topography allowed the existence of a reported one lakh chain-linked lakes/ponds, locally known as Kuntas and Cheruvus, in Hyderabad and its peripheries in the pre-independence era. Surplus water from each lake flowed down to the next water body in the basin, completing a chain link. The system worked well for the region in the Deccan Plateau where canal irrigation was not an option. Owing to the linkages, flooding could be avoided during monsoons, and there would be enough water impounded for summer crops. The rulers recognised this fact, and through their diktats, maintained the lakes’ health. They also added new lakes, constructed strong bunds and drains to control the flows, and maintained and developed them.

After independence, the lakes came under the centralised command of the Irrigation Department, alienating the users from their water bodies. Since the 1970s, the pace of urbanisation has picked up, substituting the traditional value of subsistence placed on the land with that of real estate. As the city spread, traditional vocations such as agriculture and fishing vanished. Concrete jungles took over within no time.

A unique aspect of the Asafjahi rule was its grant of titles to farmers in the lake beds so that when water receded in summer, the alluvial soil offered them bounty crop. No activity apart from farming was allowed on the lake bed.

With urbanisation fast catching up, and infrastructure creation not apace with it, lakes became the handy receptacles of the city’s sewage. Builders laid sewage lines up to the nearest lake, or connected them to the storm water drain network wherever it existed. The capital region is so replete with such interconnections between sewage lines and storm water drains that ‘dry flows’ is a standardised term for sewage flow into drains during the dry season. As a fallout, eutrophication soon set into the lakes, making the lakes rich with weed and poor in water-holding capacity and biodiversity. The fish died. The water became unfit for any kind of consumption. Slowly, but surely, the lake shrunk in area, quantity and quality.

Farmers and their descendants who had titles inside the lake beds sold the exposed land. Wherever the l akes became veritable sewage repositories , the urban poor settled in those areas. And where the waters were still pristine enough to proffer a ‘lake view’, the plots were sold at premium rates. Gigantic infrastructure development projects taken up by the successive governments, including the Outer Ring Road, Hyderabad Metro Rail, and the Strategic Road Development Plan, to name a few, tampered with the topography of the capital region and altered the hydrology of the lake basins. The role of land sharks, who many a time are the political leaders themselves, cannot be understated, in filling the foreshore areas of the lake bed with debris and raising structures within the full tank level.

It would not be an exaggeration to state that there is not one lake in the limits of Greater Hyderabad which has been exempted from this fate, including the famed Hussain Sagar lake. The status of the lakes in the municipalities/corporations surrounding the State capital is worse.

Shrinking water bodies

From one lakh, the water bodies have drastically come down to 185 within the Greater Hyderabad capital region, and to 3,132 within the limits of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) as enumerated by its Lake Protection Committee till date. Of the 185 lakes in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), for 75, the surplus weirs and courses are completely closed.

According to a report on the disappearing water bodies of Hyderabad, by the Society for Participatory Development, submitted to the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, in 2017, the city had l ost 3,245 hectares of water bodies in the previous 12 years.

The Lake Protection Committee was constituted in 2010 upon the High Court’s directions responding to a PIL. It is headed by the HMDA Commissioner, and has members from departments such as GHMC, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, Irrigation, Panchayat Raj, Environment and Forests, and five district administrations under the HMDA’s purview. The Committee had been inept in terms of enforcement. It has limited itself to counting lakes alone. It has failed to fulfil its mandate of identifying lakes, demarcating boundaries and buffer zones for them, fencing them with FTL (Full Tank Level) stones, and preserving them by preventing and removing encroachments. Of the 3,132 water bodies, all formalities have been completed with respect to only 224. This number has remained unchanged for the past one year. Even where the FTL boundaries are notified, encroachments within have remained untouched, owing to several sociopolitical dynamics.

The decay of Gurram Cheruvu

Palle Cheruvu and Gurram Cheruvu are part of the Umda Sagar lake’s watershed area as per the Survey of India’s topology sheets. Gurram Cheruvu receives its inflows from Pedda Cheruvu of the same basin, which in turn is downstream of the Burhan Khan lake. There is one more unnotified water body, the Shukur lake, in the same line, emptying into Gurram Cheruvu.

The Burhan Khan lake, which is uppermost in the hydrological chain, is a huge water body with an FTL of 132 acres, of which 130 acres were intact till 2013 when it was surveyed. The government, however, had given plots for a housing colony for the poor in the lake bed, while on the other side came up a gated community, partially encroaching on the lake. A temple is now seen under construction in the foreshore area near the weir, dumped heavily with debris. During the recent floods, the lake began to submerge the colony of the poor.

While the Pedda Cheruvu and Shukur Sagar lake are relatively unhindered, rampant construction on the surplus course of both have choked the inlet of the Gurram Cheruvu. This has inundated colonies at the lake’s mouth when a deluge of inflows arrived from upstream due to copious rains.

On the northern edge, the Gurram Cheruvu’s main sluice was buried under heavy encroachment encouraged by local leaders and their henchmen. Truckloads of debris were allegedly dumped into the lake and levelled using heavy machinery, about which a police complaint had already been lodged by the Tehsildar in the Chandrayangutta Police Station, but to no avail. When the lake brimmed after two decades, officials were caught in a cleft stick, as Hafiz Baba Nagar residents settled downstream demanded diversion of the water. Meanwhile, the lake’s backwater had drowned the Barkas locality neck deep.

Instead of clearing the encroachment, and opening the sluice, officials tried to widen the weir portion, weakening the bund. It breached at midnight, and all hell broke loose.

The decay of this lake began not more than two decades ago. “Our uncle had agriculture under the lake. We grew paddy and vegetables, and he would distribute the crop after storing some for our needs. When the bullocks got sick, we the cousins would carry the plough along in the field,” recalls Aslam Bin Haji Al Baghdadi, 25, a resident of the area. Now, there is no farming or fishing here. The water is filled with water hyacinth weed.

A sewage receptacle

Water hyacinth defines the other lake of doom, the Palle Cheruvu, too. This lake is privately owned, just like its source lake, the Umda Sagar. Umda Sagar receives its inflows from Jalapalli Lake of the same basin. Reports about encroachments into the Jalapalli Lake appeared in the media, while the HMDA is yet to notify the centuries-old tank.

Palle Cheruvu tells the story of how a water body surrounded by burgeoning residential colonies has become a sewage receptacle. When Umda Sagar upstream started overflowing, the surplus water entered Palle Cheruvu, which had only one small drain, two feet wide. While the Irrigation Department maintains that the lake had breached, local people say that the lake topped over the bund and gushed on to the road and the surrounding areas on the night when Qureshi lost eight members of his family. Post the tragedy, irrigation officials were seen dumping tonnes of earth on the bund in order to raise its height.

“The outflow channel of Palle Cheruvu meets the surplus channels of two more lakes, the Salkam Cheruvu and the Surram Cheruvu, from the same basin. Together with the Gurram Cheruvu outflow, it becomes a massive stream roaring towards the Musi River during floods. But the channel is now occupied by structures, severely restricting the flow,” says Lubna Sarwat from Save Our Urban Lakes.

Gurram Cheruvu and Palle Cheruvu are both in the HMDA’s list of notified lakes. In the Umda Sagar basin, 14 of the 28 lakes had totally disappeared between 1978 and 2017, while three were in the process of disappearing, as per the study report submitted to IISc, Bengaluru. The area under water spread had reduced from 236 hectares to 134 acres.

A 2017 research paper on remote sensing study by ICRISAT and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala records the shrinkage of water bodies in the city and its surrounding areas over 16 years. In 2005, lakes recorded a total acreage of 12,535 ha. In 2016, this reduced to 2,283 ha. This means that all the floodwater that would otherwise have been impounded in these lakes, enriching the ground water, quenching thirst and feeding biodiversity of the basin is now let berserk either into the surrounding lakes, or into low-lying areas, inundating homes and killing the residents.

A long-term action plan needed

But the authorities are still to learn their lessons. There is no single authority dealing with the lakes in the city. GHMC has a separate wing for lakes, and takes its own decisions about their development. One measure receiving criticism is the laying of walking tracks around the water bodies, by filling the boundary paths. The corporation has tried engineering solutions for inundation, such as constructing box-type RCC storm water drains from areas of flooding up to the nearest lake, but this has given rise to another problem by impounding more water than the lake can hold.

Two studies — one by Kirloskar Consultancy in 2002 for the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad and the other by the Voyants Consultancy in 2008 for GHMC — recommended widening and improving storm water drains, and diverting sewage.

The Voyants’ Master Plan divided the entire GHMC area into 16 hydraulic zones and identified 173 major drains, 391-km long, which needed decongestion and widening immediately. Its implementation necessitates the acquisition of 28,800 properties encroaching on the drains, an insurmountable task. Only about 35 km of the drains could be cleared till 2016 when the city experienced inundation yet again in several areas, forcing the government to consider the proposals seriously.

Ananth Maringanti, an environmentalist from Hyderabad Urban Labs, says, “It is time to seriously consider long-term definitive action, rather than resorting to drastic measures. The city has pushed its most deprived to the edges of the water bodies, and the socioeconomic dimensions involved in displacing them cannot be ignored.”

The devastation of the past few weeks forced the government to announce a ₹550 crore relief package. On October 19, Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao said that ₹1 lakh would be given to those whose houses were fully damaged. Owners of partially damaged houses would be given ₹50,000. Another ₹10,000 would be given to households in low-lying areas who were hit hard by the flood.

Upstream of the Gurram Cheruvu bund, where Sayeed Colony, Ali Gulshan Colony and Hamshan Colony remained flooded for several days, Ali Bin Abdallah claims that calls made to political leaders remained unanswered. Till October 20, he alleged, neither senior officers of the GHMC nor of the revenue department arrived to assess losses.

It was voluntary organisations that began to plug the perceived yawning gap in relief work. NGOs rescued victims and provided them with immediate relief in the form of food and clothing. WhatsApp groups and places of worship turned into relief war rooms. GPS coordinates of where essential supplies were needed the most were posted, with students and professionals working at the grassroots delivering them to those in need.“Providing relief began soon after rains hit the city and was crucial in plugging some gaps. To avoid duplication of work, a few organisations have come together to chalk out a strategy,” says activist S.Q. Masood.

Caught in a difficult situation, the State government is blaming the problems on the unprecedented rainfall in a single day. As per a study by the department of Civil Engineering, BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, extreme daily rainfall in the city will be a recurring phenomenon in future too. The study has postulated that in 2040, 2045, 2068, 2088 and 2098, the city may experience intense rainfall in a day ranging between 27 cm and 69 cm.

It is not possible for any city or region anywhere in the world to absorb this order of precipitation in such a short period. Sydney in December 2018, New York in October 2019 and, tragically New Orleans hit by Hurricane Katrina in October 2005, bear this out. As climate experts have observed, extreme weather events have become the norm. The question is how India should adapt to it. While there is evidence that cities such as New York, Paris and Copenhagen in the developed world have drawn up contingency plans such as constructing ‘sponges’ or ‘sinks’ to deal with sudden bursts of rain, there is little evidence to suggest that cities such as Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune, Gurugram, Vadodara and Hyderabad (which underwent a similar ordeal in 2000) have learnt from earlier harsh experiences.

These cities have made similar mistakes. Construction along river beds, wetlands and drainage pathways has blocked the flow of water to the sea in Mumbai and Chennai. Hyderabad’s major city bus station is situated on the Musi riverbed, while its hundreds of lake beds, as in Bengaluru, have been converted into high rises. Besides, the drains and rivers are not cleaned or adequately de-silted before the monsoon. Hyderabad’s Hi-Tec city had not planned for underground drainage — a telling commentary on skewed priorities in urban planning. India’s cities must have a contingency plan that goes beyond using weather warning technologies to reviewing urban planning and administration.

The Smart City concept and the National Infrastructure Pipeline focus on making roads, affordable houses and revamping drainage systems for cities, but do not recognise these as inter-connected objectives. Waste recycling should be accorded priority. It is a serious problem that municipal and urban infrastructure bodies do not function in tandem. Above all, the nexus between the politicians, bureaucracy and real estate interests, which leads to violation of zoning laws, needs to be checked. The Real Estate (Development and Regulation) Act can be re-examined to hold local bodies accountable for losses arising out of inappropriate location of properties. The insurance regulator can be consulted in this context.

Urban flooding has become a universal phenomenon. Extreme weather events induced by global climate change made flooding of cities the latest concern in disaster management. Several cities of India like Hyderabad, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Kolkata, Jamshedpur, Guwahati, etc., have witnessed floods in the past. Subsequent to 2005 Mumbai floods, the National disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has drawn up an extensive disaster management plan for dealing with the phenomenon of urban flooding. Yet, cities like Hyderabad continue to witness recurring floods.

The haphazard urbanisation has aggravated the problem of urban flooding. A climate phenomenon called Urban Heat Island Effect is leading to flooding of cities as too much rain is reported in too little time resulting in floods in cites. Given the higher density of population and existence of vital infrastructure in the cities, the urban flooding can prove to be a greater challenge.

What should be done to prevent floods in cities like Hyderabad? The comprehensive disaster management plan should envisage a multi-disciplinary and multi sectorial approach to deal with the problem. The measures can be as follows.

The unplanned growth of cities led to the overwhelming of civic infrastructure. The storm water drain system cannot handle the increased intensity of rainfall. The modern storm water drain system should be put in place taking into account the rainfall intensity not just for now but even the future predictions. Regular maintenance of rain water drains need to be taken up. The desiltation of storm water drains and sewerage flows have to be undertaken at least twice a year both before and after monsoon.

The roads are often widened to meet the growing traffic pressure. But, the natural storm water flow streams are not widened to meet the increased rainfall intensity resulting in inundation of habitations. Meanwhile, the natural rain water flow is obstructed due to encroachment of water bodies, drains etc. These encroachments have to be cleared by providing alternate spaces for rehabilitating the poor.

The vulnerability geo spatial mapping and hazard zone mapping have to be undertaken on a real time basis to take action at the earliest.

Science and technology needs to be developed for early warning, monitoring, modelling, forecasting and decision support. This will help in proper mitigation measures on a real time basis.

The cities are governed by multiple institutions like the municipal, revenue etc. This leads to chaos. Incidence response teams have be established to ensure proper coordination in disaster management works. The domestic, commercial, solid waste, industrial waste, construction debris is improperly handled causing a severe obstruction to storm water flows and contamination of urban water bodies.

Construction of water harvest structures and rain gardens should be made mandatory to not only harvest rain water but also to prevent twin problems of floods and water scarcity in urban habitations.

The participatory approach is more effective in disaster management. The resident welfare associations, community organisations, civil society groups need to be involved in a larger scale.

Click here

SEC secretary M Ashok Kumar wrote to state principal secretary (municipal administration and urban development) stating that since the model code of conduct had come into force for the GHMC elections with immediate effect, the authorities must stop distribution of cash through Mee Seva centres (government-authorised online service centres).

The SEC official said the flood relief distribution could be done after the model code of conduct comes to an end.

The SEC order came hours after a 70-year old woman died of suffocation while she was standing in a queue before Mee Seva centre at Neknampura under Golkonda police station limits.

Early this month, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao ordered distribution of ₹10,000 in cash to each of the families affected by recent heavy rains and floods in Hyderabad. The chief minister released ₹550 crore towards this cash distribution scheme and offered to release more based on the requirement.

Initially, the cash distribution was done by local TRS leaders who went door to door to pay the money. But the government was forced to stop it following complaints of largescale corruption in cash distribution. There were allegations that the TRS leaders made big money by knocking away part of the cash to be distributed among the flood victims.

Later, the government asked the people to register names online at Mee Seva Centres so that the cash could be transferred directly into the accounts of eligible individuals. But this led to further chaos, as thousands of people thronged the Mee Seva centres to submit their claims.

Serpentine queues were witnessed at several places, as beneficiaries threw to wind the social distancing norms. There were near stampede situations at some places as the police had tough time in controlling the crowds.

The registration process continued till the SEC issued orders asking the authorities to stop the process in view of the model code of conduct.

Pradesh Congress Committee working president and Malkajgiri parliamentarian A Revanth Reddy alleged that the decision of the TRS government to distribute cash to the people to garner their votes in the GHMC elections has led to the chaos.

“The TRS leaders were only interested in distributing money among the voters, rather than streamlining the flood relief works. The authorities have failed to anticipate the crowds at the Mee Seva centres,” Reddy said.

Let’s verify the claim made in the post.

The archived version of this post can be found here

Claim: Celebrations of Congress party Muslim leaders in a farmhouse during Hyderabad floods. Fact: These photos were shot during the Congress party meetings held on ’13 September 2020’ and ‘6 October 2020’, a few weeks before the Hyderabad city is affected by floods. Hence, the claim made in the post is FALSE.

Photos (1,3 and 4):

On observing the photos carefully, we could see Telangana Congress party leader Mohammed Ali Shabbir in some of the photos. On reverse image search of the photos shared in the post using these keywords, a video showing similar visuals as shared in the post was found on ‘Star News Express’ YouTube channel. This video was posted on YouTube on ‘07 October 2020’. In the description of the video, it is mentioned that more than 200 educated youth joined Congress party at Karwan Golconda division in the presence of Ex-Minister Mohammed Shabir Ali. It is mentioned that the Karwan constituency’s past MLA contestant and in charge, Mohammed Al Hajri arranged this meeting in Karwan. The same visuals were found in another YouTube video posted on ’06 October 2020’. In this video description also, it is mentioned as the Congress event conducted on ’06 October 2020’ at Karwan area of Golconda division.

Photos (2,5 and 6):

On reverse image search of the remaining photos shared in the post, we found the same photos in a Facebook post of Hyderabad Congress Minority department chairman Sameer Waliullah. In his post, he mentioned that these photos were captured during a dinner get together arranged in his farmhouse on ‘13 September 2020’. He shared these photos to thank all the leaders who attended this get together.

From all these pieces of evidence, it can be concluded that the photos shared in the post are old and not related to the Hyderabad floods caused by the heavy rains on ‘13 October 2020’.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

While there is no doubt that the highest October rains in over a century had a role in the mayhem, it also exposed another, much bigger underlying problem.

AFP

The illegal encroachments of some of the key water bodies in the city that were instrumental in absorbing the rain waters have resulted in the floodwaters inundating the streets in several low-lying areas.

Residents of low-lying areas in and around Meerpet are a worried lot as the Meerpet, Mantrala and Jillelguda lakes are brimming with water.

Encroachments since past decade

One reason, many say caused the current situation is how the lakes in Hyderabad were encroached in the past couple of decades.

BCCL

According to activists 190 lakes in GHMC limits have been encroached upon and some have even entire residential areas built on through places where the floodwaters used to flow.

Back in 2000, when the city had experienced a similar deluge, there were several studies and recommendations to clear the illegal encroachments, but nothing has been put into practice in the twenty years that followed, while the scale of the encroachments has increased.

In 2017, Telangana urban development minister and the chief minister’s son, KT Rama Rao, had termed the Kirloskar committee recommendations which called for the removal of 1,400 illegal constructions “impractical”.

BCCL

The Telangana government has repeatedly been pulled up by the National Green Tribunal which had earlier this month appointed a joint committee to look into encroachment of lakes in Nagarkurnool.

“The committee is directed to consider the question of existence of water bodies and the nature of encroachments and the steps taken to remove the same and if there is any damage caused to the environment to assess environmental compensation against the violators,” the order read.

BCCL

Historical documents show that the area under water bodies has shrunk from 6,000 hectares to 4,700 hectares with a large number of lakes and small water bodies have been completely lost to construction.



Another problem many have pointed out in Hyderabad due to the rapid, unplanned urbanization is the lack of drainages.

BCCL

According to some estimates, Hyderabad needs at least 2-2.5 times the length of drainage networks that exists currently.

This has left entire residential areas submerged for days now, with the residents there still clueless on how long will it take to drain the water.",issue,Hyderabad Floods,"Hyderabad, Telangana, India","October 13, 2020","October 15, 2020",Hyderabad city,24 cm,"Hundreds of houses damaged, crores of rupees worth of property destroyed",11,"Thousands of people evacuated, traffic disrupted, power outages",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The reasons are mostly known: increasing and mostly unplanned urbanisation, rural-urban migration, encroachments of water bodies, concretization of flood plains and other lands, decreasing capacity to hold, store, recharge and drain the rainwater, increasing rainfall intensities with changing climate, wrong operation of big dams and deteriorating governance.

The damages are going up, also because our forecasts are far from reliable, accurate, location-specific or with sufficient lead time. Because of our incapacity to learn lessons. Disaster preparedness or management is practically non-existent. There is no attempt to even systematically document the phenomena.

In the monsoon of 2020 alone, we saw increasing cases of cities where rivers were running through the streets: Bharuch, Dehradun, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Pune, Solapur to name a few. The trend follows from Ahmedabad, Mumbai in 2005, Surat in 2006, Kolkata in 2007, Hyderabad, Jamshedpur in 2008, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Mahabubnagar, Kurnool and Delhi in 2009, Leh, Guwahati and Delhi in 2010, Haridwar-Rishikesh in 2013, Srinagar in 2014, Chennai in 2015, Patna in 2016, Chennai, Mumbai in 2017, Kochi in 2018, Bangalore, Gurgaon, Kolhapur, Patna, Sangli in 2019 and so on.

One bright spot is that our capacity to rescue and immediate relocation has improved, thanks to NDRF (National Disaster Response Force) and SDRFs (State Disaster Response Force). But 15 years since its formation through a powerful national act, even the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), has not been able to make a major dent here.

The NDMA came out with guidelines for “Management of Urban Flooding” in 2010 and for “Management of Floods” in 2008. The Urban Flood guidelines talk about drainage, master plan, response, even dam operations & mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction in the development process. But we can see little impact on the ground.

Every major urban development project, including townships, industries, roads, bridges, metros etc have an impact on hydrology & flood vulnerability of the city. That means, in order to achieve informed decision making, those at the helm of governance must understand the hydrological impact assessment of every such proposal. Have we seen any such assessment?

Our project approval documents or environment impact assessment reports, which should be having such assessments, mostly remain ritualistic box ticking, cut and paste exercises. The attempt to dilute the norms further under the ongoing draft EIA notification shows the direction in which we are moving.

The Central Water Commission (CWC) is the only flood forecasting organisation of India, but its performance remains pathetic. Incidents from Uttarakhand, Kashmir, North East and Karnataka have time and again highlighted that CWC’s flood forecasting system has been extremely inconsistent. It has failed miserably to raise alerts on time and save human lives and property.

Flood forecasting is such an important activity in flood management. But the NDMA seems afraid to even critique CWC’s pathetic flood forecasting performance, for no known reasons. Most importantly, there has never been an independent assessment of CWC’s work.

Lack of capacity to hold off rainwater

Everyone knows about the Standard Operating Procedures required to deal with floods: adequate drainage; good, advance quantitative precipitation forecasts that will provide estimates of rain water in specific watersheds and sub basins; models that will predict water depths at specific locations; inundation maps; early warning systems; evacuation plans, and a disaster management system that will implement all of this.

But whose baby is all this?

Even when the responsibilities are well defined (e.g. Sardar Sarovar Flood manual for downstream villages and cities), who will ensure that it gets implemented? And what will be the consequences when the actions are not implemented as per plan?

Cities need enough capacity to hold, store, recharge and drain water. Equal to the probable quantitative precipitation (PQP) or probable amount of rainfall in the city catchment area for once-in-fifty-years floods (the highest intensity rainfall in fifty years). If a city does not have that capacity, floods will be unavoidable.

This capacity keeps changing as cities develop. So does the PQP-50, with changing climate. So both Capacity and PQP need continuous recalibration for each city. And depending on the difference between the two for any given city or area, it will need preparedness to face the floods.

In the context of climate change, we need increased capacity since the intensity of rainfall is going up. In coastal areas, high tides will also enter the equation. How many cities have done such an assessment? Possibly none.

In fact, we seem to be continuously decreasing our capacity to hold/ store, recharge or drain the rain water. The new and fast spreading fad of river front development is actually reducing the drainage capacity of the cities. The rivers then will flow in the streets as it happened this monsoon in Jaipur (river front development here has concretised river sides and even beds) and Dehradun (massive encroachment of floodplains and riverbeds).

Cities taking small steps: A few examples

We have a lot of examples that show failures, but far fewer that can be called successes. However, there are elements of successful or notable examples from a number of cities.

For example, the Yamuna Monitoring Committee set up by the National Green Tribunal in Delhi is a remarkable kind of institutional innovation to protect the Yamuna river and its floodplain in Delhi. Recently, the Yamuna Monitoring Committee took quick cognizance and swung into action when certain violations were highlighted by SANDRP in an official complaint. The Committee directed Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) to visit the Yamuna floodplain and submit the action reports.

(Action taken by Yamuna Committee on the complaint by SANDRP. Pic: SANDRP)

Bangalore has a number of examples including lake rejuvenation and management in which citizens are majorly involved, the Million Wells initiative that has also started from outside the government.

Vadodara citizens have succeeded in halting the riverfront development in the city.

Pune citizens are raising their voices to abandon the riverfront development for the Mula and Mutha rivers.

Chennai used to be a pioneer in rainwater harvesting till about 15 years ago.

The Delhi government has initiated projects to recharge groundwater using Yamuna floodwaters in floodplains near Palla and also started taking up decentralised Sewage Treatment Plants. But it will still take a lot of doing before we can see a city as an example of ideal water and flood management.

Globally, cities are going towards sponge cities and room for the river concepts. A sponge city is a city structured and designed to absorb and capture rainwater, which will also help reduce floods. Rainwater harvested should be key for such cities. Rainwater harvesting is part of a sustainable system on an urban scale. Room for the River basically ensures that rivers have the necessary space to perform its functions including draining the flood. Buildings and infrastructure are being changed in line with such concepts.

What can ULBs do?

A lot of the disastrous consequences of urban floods can be avoided, reduced. Whose responsibility is it to ensure that? Are there consequences when dams are mismanaged and create avoidable disaster?

There is a lot that Urban Local Bodies can do in this regard. They need to have a living, flood management action plan that gets reviewed every year. They need to set up independent assessment of each flood event to learn necessary lessons, fix accountability.

The ULB needs to coordinate between different departments including those in charge of solid waste management, storm water drains, sewage, industrial effluents and building permissions. There is a need to make necessary changes in master plans, building bylaws and ensure their strict implementation.

Every city needs to have an active flood management group that will constantly monitor the situation and issue necessary alerts, directions and ensure implementation. Possibly, statutorily, the ULB should be made answerable for Urban Flood disasters.

The Government of India has a smart city programme, but the programme does not have an explicit agenda to create ‘flood-smart’ cities — cities that are able to manage heavy rainfall without creating disasters. In fact, the already high water and flood footprint of the cities are growing but they are operating in complete policy vacuum. India urgently needs a National Urban Water Policy that will also provide clearly defined guidelines for urban flood management.

As the Telegraph editorial after the recent Hyderabad floods concluded: “This wilful disregard for public safety can only be attributed to a culture of impunity for the administration. The cost of the absence of accountability is being borne by cities and the people who inhabit them.”

The problem is known, the diagnosis is available, the prescription is also more or less clear. The question is where is the road map to move towards the destination? Till we achieve that, let us be assured that the frequency, intensity and spread of urban flood disasters is only going to increase.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

The two waves of record-breaking rain submerged several localities of the cosmopolitan city and left thousands of poor and lower-middle-class residents in the lurch.

According to the Telangana government, around Rs 222 crore worth of road infrastructure was affected as a result of torrential rains that lashed Hyderabad. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) estimates a loss of Rs 567 crore to property.

The state government had earlier decided to release Rs 550 crore for immediate flood relief.

""Due to the heavy rains and floods, water entered the houses and damaged everything, including the essential commodities, clothes etc. People were not in a position to even cook their meals. Hence, we have decided to extend aid of Rs 10,000 to each family as immediate financial assistance to them,"" Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao said. He has also instructed officials to ensure that at least one lakh people get this financial aid each day.

'Seven-eight people from each household claiming relief'

Meanwhile, flood-affected residents of Shaikpet, Himathnagar, Jubilee Hills and Amberpet areas have alleged discrimination in flood relief distribution. They claim that they have not received any financial assistance from the government.

""The money is not coming from one's own pocket. It is government money and it is our right. We have lost everything but not received a single penny while those who were not affected received the money. In many houses, seven-eight people have claimed relief money,"" said an agitated Shazia, a resident of the old city.

Several NGOs working on the ground to provide relief to almost 50,000 people in Hyderabad alone have demanded an independent assessment of the damage and fair distribution of relief funds.

Bribing voters ahead of civic body elections?

The Rs 10,000 interim cash relief has also stirred political controversy.

BJP and Congress have alleged that the state government's announcement is linked to the upcoming GHMC polls, terming it a way of ""officially bribing"" voters.

""The ruling party leaders have used this as a money-making opportunity. Several colonies are still underwater and many places streets are not cleared. Ruling party leaders are embezzling money meant for relief work. There is no transparency in the distribution of ex gratia. The local leaders are adding a bogus name to claim relief,"" alleged Congress' G Narayan Reddy.

However, the ruling TRS has denied all such allegations, saying 'politics' over flood relief is 'condemnable'.

""We are providing relief at the doorstep of affected people. CM released Rs 500 crores for interim relief and over Rs 130 crore was distributed also. We are not understanding whether BJP, Congress want help for the poor people or not,"" said M Krishank of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS).

The GHMC is one of the largest municipal corporations in India and its jurisdiction spans across four districts -Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medchal-Malkajgiri and Sangareddy. A total of 24 assembly constituencies and five Lok Sabha constituencies in Telangana fall under the limits of the GHMC.

At present, the TRS and AIMIM have a majority in the GHMC with 99 and 44 corporator seats respectively. The terms of these corporators end in February and preparations are already underway for the civic body elections.

Chandrashekar Rao’s aid of Rs 10,000 each to some 400,000 distraught families to cope with the challenges posed by the October 14 rains and floods in Hyderabad has done little to alleviate people’s misery. The pounding rain—recorded as 32 cm in less than 24 hours—left colonies inundated, residents marooned for days on end and buildings that should have long been razed further weakened. The havoc, which has already claimed 50 lives, prompted conscientious citizens in several residential communities to step up vigil on their own.

The floods came at the tail end of the extended southwest monsoon season (the cut-off date is usually September 30), which has seen water bodies brimming and groundwater levels rising higher than they did in a decade. Telangana had already received excess rainfall of 50 per cent between June and September, filling these water bodies up. Localities in the vicinity witnessed bund breaches.

Among the reasons for the October flooding is the rampant encroachment on the banks of most of the 3,132 lakes, of which many have disappeared, in the Hyderabad-Secunderabad area. Such constructions have obstructed the natural flow of rainwater, leading to breaches and, consequently, the floods. Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HDMA) rules prohibit building and development activity on the bed of water bodies. This, however, has been flouted. An ambitious plan, drawn up by HMDA over six years ago, to demarcate the ‘full tank level’ (FTL) of water bodies—the highest level to which water can be stored—in the urban agglomeration has remained largely on paper. The FTL of only 224 lakes was firmed up and the boundaries notified.

The floods are a catastrophic consequence of successive governments—of the Congress, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and now the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS)—turning a blind eye to the mushrooming of colonies on water bodies.

When the TRS won the 2014 legislative assembly election to form Telangana’s first government, KCR had raised hopes of transforming Hyderabad into a global city by capitalising on its inherent strengths, such as the city being a major IT destination, expanding infrastructure riding on the development of the Nehru Outer Ring Road that skirts the city, and the Hyderabad Metro, then under construction. The KCR government wooed tech and fintech entities, and today, Hyderabad boasts of large facilities of Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and several other MNCs. Only earlier this month, Goldman Sachs told state municipal administration and urban development minister K.T. Rama Rao (KTR), who also holds the industries and IT portfolios, that the company intends to set up its second India office for global shared footprint services in the city.

While KTR has drawn investors and helped them set up shop seamlessly through the state’s single-window clearance system, TS-iPass, this has not been complemented by adequate urban infrastructure growth, except mostly in the western parts of Hyderabad. Compounding the problems is the fact that the HMDA, which is the urban planning overseer, and the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), the elected body that manages civic affairs, have not always worked in tandem.

A cable suspension bridge across the Durgam Cheruvu lake that was inaugurated on September 25 is touted as a symbol of a rapidly developing Hyderabad. At 234 metres, it is the longest bridge in the city and connects upscale Jubilee Hills with the financial district, cutting commute time from about 45 minutes earlier to just 10 minutes. Several new roads and elevated corridors have also sprung up as elements of a larger Strategic Road Development Plan to quicken commute and decongest traffic. Another striking decision was the one to scrap billboards, a source of revenue for the cash-strapped GHMC, reportedly to improve the city’s look. “The government is interested in cosmetic changes rather than finding long-term solutions,” says S. Jeevananda Reddy, convenor of the Forum for a Sustainable Environment, India.

The state government has been lax on the basic aspects of planned urban development, such as enforcing zoning restrictions and disallowing unlawful constructions. “From unplanned construction to the destruction of the city’s many water bodies, Hyderabad has done everything horribly wrong,” says environmental expert Prof. K. Purushotham Reddy. Mega housing projects have come up in the catchment areas of lakes.

“The failure to understand the functional aspects of a city’s water bodies and looking at them for ornamental and recreational purposes is as good as placing a wreath on a corpse,” says B.V. Subba Rao, a former water and climate change expert at the Engineering Staff College of India, Hyderabad. “If one recognises these lakes as flood-control structures, the entire city’s plan would have to be changed because governments have turned lakes into parks and recreational spots in the past.” Subba Rao adds that to prevent floods in the future, the city’s hydrology map must be superimposed on the master plan and the natural drainage system augmented.

Hyderabad has faced major floods in the past, such as in August 2000 when the city received 24 cm of rainfall in a day. “Neither GHMC nor the state government have considered the need to develop climate resilience,” says Prof. Reddy, pointing out that while the government pegs the losses from this month’s floods at over Rs 5,000 crore, it is offering in all Rs 400 crore as compensation to the poor.

Hyderabad: The worst floods in a century in Hyderabad has ravaged the lives of hundreds of thousands of people and caused property damage worth Rs 5000 core according to preliminary estimates.

Even though certain sections of media leave no stone unturned to vilify the Muslim community, they have stood up for the cause of relief work to sustain and rebuild the lives of those who have been ravaged by the unprecedented floods that left at least 50 persons dead in Telangana.

The US-based Indian Muslim Relief and Charities (IMRC) is coming to the rescue of hundreds of flood-affected people in the city to restart their livelihoods with charity plans worth Rs 1.5 crore.

At the aftermath of the floods, the charity organization has been carrying out relief and rescue work across the city of nawabs with sister organisation Sahayata Trust.

As relief measures, the group of volunteers from Sahayata Trust has been distributing clothes, blanket, food, medical assistance, apart from arranging shelter for the victims of the deadly floods following the torrential rains.

The group has distributed more than 500 packets of ready to eat food, as well as more than 150 packets of rice to sustain the devastated families in the city. The group also has distributed more than 5000 litres of milk to families of flood victims. While they have been working to assist families whose houses remain submerged underwater, they have arranged for shelter for 12 families on October 18.

As part of its relief work, IMRC also has planned detailed community-level intervention to support the lives of poor and marginalised families whose source of income has been wiped out by the deluge.

The IMRC has started supporting families with ration and it will support at least 1000 families in the city. The members of the Sahayata Trust said that they will initiate programmes to rebuild houses, repair cab and autos and support those who used run small grocery shops in various localities.

To provide medical assistance to the injured during the floods and those who might fall sick after the water recedes, the IMRC along with Indo-US Hospital, located at Malakpet area, has made arrangements for free treatment, the members of the trust said.

The group has been actively working for support the flood-affected people at various places including Jalpally, Venkatapur, Osman Nagar, Habeen Nagar, Khairatabad, and Faluknama among other localities.

The India Meteorological Department (IDM) Telangana had forecasted heavy rains at isolated places in the state till October 22. Before this, the downpour on Saturday night for six to seven hours, measuring close to 20cm of rainfall, caused the second wave of floods in the city. The city has been reeling under savage floods since October 14 following torrential rains caused by a “deep depression” formed after a low-pressure system developed in the North Andaman Sea on October 9.

IMRC has been committed to the cause of relief and rehabilitation works following various natural disasters across India. During the colossal Bihar floods in 2016 and subsequent floods, IMRC assisted more than 3,030 flood-affected families with ration.

On Wednesday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had said the northeast monsoon has commenced over extreme south peninsular India, including Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

Chennai has a history of flooding, especially during this time of the year. 2015 saw one of the worst of its kind deluge after almost the entire city of Chennai got inundated due to heavy rain.

While the heaviest rain in nearly a decade was partly to be blamed for the floods; what made the situation worse is the unplanned development and uncontrolled encroachment on wetlands and other natural water bodies, which to a great extent, used to absorb the rain water.

Though several proposals and announcements were made in the wake of the 2015 floods, yet another deluge after overnight rain is proof that nothing has been done on the ground to make sure such disasters do not repeat.

This is almost a repeat of what happened weeks ago in another south Indian city - Hyderabad - which was flooded due to days of heavy rain.

In Hyderabad too the main culprit was the unchecked encroachment on the city's water bodies including lakes.

According to activists, 190 lakes in GHMC limits have been encroached upon and some even have entire residential areas built on places where the floodwaters used to flow.

In the most recent spell, on October 17-18, 2020, the city recorded rainfall in excess of 200 mm overnight, resulting in a flurry of run-off that submerged the entire city. More than 76 people have died; damages have been pegged at Rs 1,000 crore.

It is evident that the annual rainfall has been increasing with time and is likely to result in more instances of urban flooding.

While the city grapples with urban floods frequently in a changing climate, the response to prevent urban floods remains toothless: The strategies are limited to provisioning of more drainage channels.

Hyderabad is located on the ridge of the Krishna and Godavari river basins, approximately 150 kilometres away. With the undulating hilly topography of the Deccan region, Hyderabad and its environs were dotted with a number of natural water bodies such as lakes and tanks.

In addition to these, successive rulers built various tanks from the 16th-18th century such as Hussain Sagar, Mir Alam Tank, Afzal Sagar, Jalpalli, Ma-sehaba Tank, Talab Katta, Osmansagar and Himayatsagar.

A number of small tanks were also built by the zamindars during these times. Historically, the city comprised 400 lakes. At least 48 flood absorbing tanks were built as part of a stormwater system in 1912-1929.

These water bodies provided cushions to absorb and store rainwater. Most of them have been converted into housing colonies by reclamation, according to Agarwal, A and Narain, S, 1999 (Dying Wisdom).

The city has grown spatially to 729.9 square kilometre (2014) from 216.7 sq km (1990), with an exponential increase in the built-up area at the expense of water bodies and open spaces in the city.

Currently, only 169 lakes exist in the city. Several water channels that used to carry floodwaters from one lake to the next in a catchment area have also been encroached by private and government agencies.

The existing urban stormwater management in the city is largely based on conventional approaches implemented in developed countries during the 20th century, which aimed to evacuate the run-off from the city as quickly as possible instead of endeavouring to store and reuse it.

This means constructing more and more grey infrastructure constituting road-side drains. Here, the design standard accounts for three-five years return period run-off. The service-level benchmarks (SLBs) focus on only on construction or retrofit of these road side drains for stormwater management.

However, this approach alone is limited in its ability to account for uncertainties in climate projections as well as to manage precipitation events that are more extreme than considered in design standards.

The road-side drainage infrastructure in the city is under multiple authorities: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), the Public Works Department (PWD) and the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) are the major players.

In addition to these, the natural drains in the city and the extended metropolitan areas are under the Telangana Irrigation and CAD department. Desilting exercises are also carried out by GHMC in some natural drains.

A majority of lakes in the city are under GHMC and HMDA, whereas their catchment areas are under multiple public and private ownerships.

Due to multiplicity of authorities, there are issues of coordination and lack of enforcement, and the stormwater infrastructure is largely unequipped to handle moderate and extreme rainfall events.

Way forward

To address urban issues of the 21st century, we need to look beyond the Victorian engineering solutions and adopt new perspectives.

There is a need to push for alternative stormwater management techniques that can lead to a sustainable groundwater infiltration, protect local water bodies as well as avoid urban flooding in the long run. This amounts to lowering hydrological impact of urbanisation and increasing the carrying capacity of urban areas.

Protecting local water bodies (lakes, ponds and wetlands) that act as sponge in high-rainfall events, hence reducing the volume of rainwater run-off and lowers the risk of flood and water logging

Promoting rainfall infiltration into the soil at public places, including open areas in cities through elements of landscape design of vegetated swales and bio-retention systems.

The city has 1,017 parks and playgrounds spanning 281 hectares that provide potential for moderating run-off through principles of retention. They also help in recharging groundwater through infiltration.

These strategies should also address issues of integration of urban drainage with other urban services and urban planning with regular observations and management.

Risk and vulnerability assessment is as an essential part of the stormwater masterplan, which will inform regarding the following:

Flood-prone areas

Chronic water-logging locations

Vulnerable residential areas and potential population that can be impacted due to flood

Moderating floods

Alternative and additional measures (storage / infiltration / delayed surface run-off) remain relatively unused in the city. These techniques help to reduce not only flood events and the creation of stagnant ponds but also the volume of contaminated water discharged into the environment.

Stormwater management plans must contain an inventory of existing and planned public parks, open spaces and water bodies.

This important information about preserving natural features such as water bodies and watershed areas should be supported with a list of evaluated alternatives such as using traditional drainage channels (gray) infrastructure versus more efficient and economic low-impact (green) infrastructure.

As the city expands, areas must be planned and developed on the principles of water-sensitive design and planning, that is, parks and open spaces should be planned and designed for infiltration.

As per the planning norms, parks of area up to 2,000 sq m are to be provided for 500-2,500 households. Neighborhood parks of area between 2,000 and 10,000 sq km and community parks of area between 2 and 20 hectares are to be planned and developed. These open spaces provide immense potential for flood mitigation for future development areas.

Collaboration between stakeholders

Nothing is possible without collaboration to develop the required linkages between different expertise. The specialists and stakeholders need to harmonise stormwater management related activities.

The city needs to put stormwater management in line with urban planning — as part of an integrated and interactive process between architect / urban designer, planner, landscape architect; ecologist, hydrologist, academician; engineer, contractor; local authorities; non-profits, resident welfare associations and local residents.

198,2347,hyderabad,2019,https://thewire.in/health/hyderabad-rain-flood-malaria-dengue-water-stagnation,19 Oct 2019,"In Their Wake, Floods Leave Puddles of Illnesses Around Hyderabad","Heavy rains slammed Hyderabad last month, inundating many areas and stranding commuters around the city. It was the most rain the city had received in September in a hundred years.

When it accumulates, rain water isn’t just water. It’s mixed with run-off, sewage, faecal matter, chemicals and a host of other substances. When it comes into contact with a source of water for human use, it renders it unsafe for drinking, befouls homes and generally macerates the landscape. It’s chock full of viruses, bacteria, parasites and a variety of other pathogens that can cause viral, bacterial and fungal diseases.

Heavy rains and floods wash off mosquitoes and their larvae, temporarily checking their breeding. But this state of affairs doesn’t last long: when flood waters recede, they leave behind puddles of putrid water stagnating all over the place, which are prime mosquito breeding grounds. Standing water facilitates rapid infection, especially of mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and chikungunya. And Hyderabad was already reeling from a dengue outbreak before the rains arrived.

Dengue has four strains, all of which have been circulating in Hyderabad. V. Ramana Dhara, an adjunct clinical professor at Emory University, Atlanta, and a professor at the Indian Institute of Public Health, Hyderabad, explained that any of these can cause a dengue infection, whose symptoms are classified as inapparent, self-managed, non-severe, severe and fatal. The community burden is due to inapparent and self-managed infections whereas the clinical burden — requiring treatment from a doctor or at a hospital — due to non-severe, severe and fatal infections, he added.

“Because infection can result from any of the four strains, and immunity to one strain does not protect from the other strains, repeat infections can occur.”

Dengue is spread by Aedes mosquitoes, principally Aedes aegypti. “Given the recent rains, there are certainly many more mosquitoes and the number of mosquito-borne diseases are [sure] to rise,” Dhara predicted.

Studies have shown floods can cause wound infections, skin rashes, gastrointestinal infections, tetanus and leptospirosis. But “in the absence of reliable statistics, it is hard to say which diseases are more prevalent,” Dhara said. “but it’s safe to say that the risk of all of the above is likely to increase depending on local circumstances.”

Although leptospirosis is less common, it cannot be discounted because it’s often misdiagnosed. It’s a bacterial disease and leads to a stubborn infection. Rats and mice have these bacteria in their urine, so when their urine mixes with rainwater, the disease can quickly spread through a city. The bacteria enter the body through the skin or mucous membranes. People with cuts, abrasions and/or scratches wading in contaminated are particularly vulnerable.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, leptospirosis can develop two days to four weeks after being exposed to the bacteria. Its symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, jaundice, skin rash and red eyes. And these symptoms are often mistaken as signs of other diseases, leaving the actual infection to fester. If it isn’t treated on time, leptospirosis can lead to kidney damage, brain inflammation, liver failure, even death.

“The risk can be greatly reduced by not swimming or wading in water that might be contaminated with animal urine. Protective clothing or footwear should be worn by those exposed to contaminated water or soil because of their job or recreational activities,” Dhara said.

Apart from Aedes, there’s the Anopheles species. “Water puddles are breeding places for Anopheles species that can act as vectors for malaria parasites,” K. Arun Kumar, an assistant professor in the department of animal sciences at the University of Hyderabad, said. He works on Plasmodium parasites and malaria.

“There is a direct correlation between heavy rains, humidity and mosquito breeding. Temperatures of 22-26º C favour extensive propagation of mosquitoes,” he explained.

After mating, the female Anopheles mosquito has a tendency to feed on blood and lay its eggs in water. These eggs transform in a week’s time to larva and pupa, and then emerge as adults. When it feeds on human blood, malaria parasites already present in the human can pass into the mosquito or, if the mosquito is the carrier, the parasites pass into the human.

“Removing stagnant water in and around the houses and covering water tanks with proper lids will [keep] mosquitoes [from] returning to the water. Also, bed nets are effective in reducing the incidence of mosquitoes coming in contact with humans, thereby preventing mosquito borne diseases,” Kumar said.

Even if there aren’t stagnant pools of water, there certainly are damp surfaces, many of which aren’t exposed to sunlight either because they’re in nooks or because it’s cloudy. Mold only needs moisture and oxygen, and isn’t picky about which part of the house the dampness is in. It feeds on moist organic matter, wood, paper and cloth, and causes irritation in the eyes, cough and lung infections.

“Prevention is far better than cure,” Dhara said. “Each specific disease has well known prevention measures but implementation is lacking.”

L. Amar, the chief medical officer of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, says they’re taking all preventive measures, like fogging and spraying, mandating health check-ups, monitoring cases and investigation, and improving sanitation. He attributed the ongoing crisis to the seemingly interminable rains, because of which the water never drains completely, and stagnant and putrid puddles persist for longer. “That is helping mosquitoes breed.”

He added that the team of workers responsible for clearing the metropolitan water-drainage system has been assigned to getting rid of such pools.

The administration hopes that the situation will be improve in the next two or three weeks, especially if the people of Hyderabad acknowledge the gravity of the situation and cooperate. “What is important is that people should come forward to improve sanitation and personal hygiene, and check mosquito-breeding spots in their living places,” Amar said.

That said, although mosquitoes don’t discriminate between the rich and the poor, the burden of disease always seems to fall on the poor. So areas with a higher density of settlement, such as slums, are more prone to disease outbreaks when it rains.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe
199,2348,hyderabad,2019,https://thewire.in/urban/hyderabad-rains-flood,25 Sept 2019,"Hyderabad Hit by Torrential Rains, Several Areas Left Flooded","New Delhi: Several parts of Hyderabad were flooded after the city received torrential rainfall on Tuesday, with commuters reportedly stranded by traffic snarls caused by water accumulating on arterial roads.

Telangana urban development minister K.T. Rama Rao said that the city received its highest rainfall in over a hundred years, with many parts of Secunderabad received rainfall more than 100 mm. The city’s average rainfall for the month of September hovers around 158 mm. According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society, areas such as Tirumalagiri received 121.8 mm, while Uppal received 120.8 mm as of Wednesday morning.

Municipal authorities said this was the second-highest rainfall recorded in the month of September in 111 years.

According to reports, Marredpally and Musheerabad areas of the city received around 114 mm of rain, while other parts such as Begumpet, Monda Market, Habsiguda and Bowenpally also received more than 100 mm in rainfall.



The massive rainfall resulted in the flooding of several arterial roads in the city, with traffic in the Cyberabad area – the IT hub – coming to a standstill. Videos posted on Twitter show bikers and pedestrians making their way through knee-deep water. Reports said that the Cyberabad traffic police asked IT companies to let their employees leave in staggered batches to ease the traffic. Commuters were also seen taking shelter under the Hyderabad metro rail stations.

Flooding has become an annual phenomenon in the southern city and activists say rapid urbanisation that has neglected the topography of the area, is a major reason. In the IT hub region, rocks and lakes were flattened or filled to make way for office and residential spaces. The Forum for Good Governance, a civil society group, said that the constructions have disrupted the natural water flow, which now causes flooding. In many other parts of the city, activists have regularly flagged encroachment of lakes.

The city has also been under the grip of vector-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and malaria. However, experts said that the rains may have helped wash away the larvae of mosquitoes that carry the diseases. An expert on infectious diseases told Deccan Chronicle that the continuous spell of rain “has helped to wash away the eggs which were laid during the dry days”. He, however, wanted the government to take preventive methods – fogging, clearing up litter and repairing sewage systems – to ensure that the threat passes.

Other parts of Telangana also received heavy rainfall, according to reports. Mancherial district received the highest rainfall at 132 mm, while Nampalle in Rajanna-Sricilla district got 95.5 mm, followed by 94.8 mm at Chimanpalle in Nizamabad district.

The Indian Meteorological Department in Hyderabad has warned that heavy rains are likely to continue at isolated places in the districts of Warangal, Mulugu and others till September 26.

The flood-drought cycle in the country too will be more frequent. The south west monsoon season ends in September but according to analysis of data published in the IMS journal Vayu Mandal, the contribution of the south-west monsoon is on the decline.

Weather expert Rajanikanth Poolla explained, “The major concern about the pattern of the Indian monsoon is the uneven distribution of rainfall. There is an increasing instance of excessive rain leading to floods in smaller regions and droughts in other parts. Rainfall in the monsoon season is reducing in recent years. The pattern shows that the monsoon arrives in June but slows down and goes weak for prolonged periods, and is activated only when there is low pressure in the Bay of Bengal or cyclonic circulation in the Arabian Sea. Hence, after the onset of the monsoon there is a revival system which occurs and then only is there further monsoon.”

The Indian monsoon is greatly influenced by global weather and climate patterns like El-Nino and La-Nina and these are affecting the rainfall cycle in the country.

Drought was notable in 2002, 2004, and 2009 while in 2011 there was above average monsoon rain.

Experts and various models predict that the rainfall distribution and its pattern will change further. The impact of global warming will induce hyper local severe weather phenomenon like cloud bursts, intense lightning over short periods and in shorter geographical areas.

According to IMD data, between June 1 and August 14 there was deficit rainfall in 25 districts and excess rainfall in 38 districts in the country. A senior member of IMS also has IMS explained, “In TS the month of August seemed to be making up the rain deficit. But that is not so. We are now again having a dry spell and that is only going to increase the deficit. The pre and post monsoon showers that are frequently seen will be due to the depression in the Bay of Bengal but they cannot be termed as covering up for the rains which were to fall during the season.”",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Flood water being released from the Jurala project, which is receiving huge inflows of over 8 lakh cusecs, is flowing to the brim of the Krishna river at temple the town of Beechupally in Jogulmba-Gadwal district since Sunday morning.

As a result of the flooding, the Pushkar ghats on both sides of the river at Beechupally were submerged. The temple town, famous for Anjaneya Swamy temple, continued to get heavy flood water. The Siva Lingam on the bank of the river was partially submerged. So were the houses and some pucca structures close to the river banks, which saw flood water entering them. Beechupally is located 20 km downstream of the Jurala project, from where the flood water is being discharged through 62 spillway gates since Saturday night.

With rising water in the river course, devotees and travellers on NH-44 connecting Hyderabad to Bengaluru stopped on the road bridge to watch the spectacle as the muddy water flowed towards Srisailam reservoir. A traveller G. T. Rajesh, said several cars and two-wheelers were parked on one side of the bridge as visitors thronged there to watch the river flow. “Police patrolling vehicles were deployed to clear the traffic. Vehicle users and others were asked to move away,” he said.

Traffic congestion

A policeman deployed at the bridge said: “We are regulating traffic on the bridge in order to avoid traffic congestion on NH-44. Traffic cones were put on the bridge to streamline traffic flow. We expect more people to throng the bridge,” he said.

Another pilgrim to the temple town said they were reminded of the 2009 historic floods, which had marooned the bridge and nearby villages. It was selfie time for the visitors too on the bridge as they tried to get the overflowing river in the picture frames. On either side of the NH-44 police patrolling vans were deployed. The road leading to the island village of Gurram Gadda was cut off as the flood water overflowed the approach road to Beerelli.",flood,Krishna River Floods,"Beechupally, Jogulamba-Gadwal district, Telangana","August 11, 2019","August 12, 2019","['Beechupally', 'Gurram Gadda']",8 lakh cusecs,"['Pushkar ghats submerged', 'houses and pucca structures flooded']",0,"['traffic congestion', 'selfie time for visitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Normally the monsoon in north India recedes by the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month has been 37% above normal. If the situation continues for the remaining few days, it will be the latest the monsoon has ever receded in decades, according to experts in the India Meteorological Department.

Many areas of the country are still getting unprecedented rain, the latest being the town of Pune in western India, where torrential rain on Wednesday and Thursday caused several deaths and havoc from collapsed buildings.

Homes were flooded and people waded through streets with water up to their knees in scenes normally seen only at the height of the monsoon.

Other cities such as Kolkata, Lucknow and Hyderabad have also experienced heavy rainfall. Uttarakhand state in the north has seen extensive damage to homes from the prolonged rains.

The monsoon was also late to arrive. Many areas suffered water shortages and farmers braced themselves for a possible drought.

The extended monsoon is not welcome among farmers. “This amount of rain is not normal at this time of the year. It is making my vegetables – I’ve got cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes at the moment – rot,” said Prakash Mehra, a small farmer in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand.

For consumers, the impact of the delayed and now late-receding monsoon has meant a rise in the price in the price of onions, an essential ingredient in Indian food. Onions are selling at 80 rupees (about £1) a kilo in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai, as opposed to the normal 20 rupees (23p).

Festivals are also at risk. The next big festival is Dussehra on 8 October, when Hindus erect giant, comic book-style effigies of Ravana, a figure from the Hindu epic The Ramayana who sports a bushy moustache and an evil grin.

Burning Ravana symbolises the triumph of good over evil. But given that the effigies are made of paper, if the monsoon continues, Ravana might have the last laugh.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Odisha has come out with a unique flood hazard atlas on the basis of historic flood inundation captured through satellite imagery over the period from 2001 to 2018, which is expected to help the State manage floods more efficiently.

The National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Hyderabad had taken the study on flood hazard zonation for Odisha. The atlas was released by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik at the State-level Natural Calamity Meeting here on Saturday.

Vast areas of the State are inundated when there is flooding every year in major rivers, namely, the Mahanadi, Brahmani, Baitarani, Subarnarekha and Rushikulya. Some of the rivers like, the Vamsadhara and Budhabalanga, also cause flash floods due to instant run-off from their hilly catchments.

According to Bishnupada Sethi, Managing Director, Odisha State Disaster Management Authority (OSDMA), damages due to floods are caused mainly by the Mahanadi, the Brahmani and the Baitarani, which have a common delta where floodwaters intermingle, and, when in spate simultaneously, wreak considerable havoc.

The entire coastal belt is prone to storm surges, which is usually accompanied by heavy rainfall, thus making the estuary region vulnerable to both storm surges and river flooding. Few districts in the western and southern part of Odisha are prone to flash floods, he pointed out.

The NRSC analysis says about 8.96% (13.96 lakh hectares) of land in Odisha was affected by floods during 2001-2018. Out of total flood-affected area (13.96 lakh hectares), about 2.81 lakh hectares of land falls under high (inundated seven-nine times) to very high (inundated 10-14 times) flood hazard categories.

Eight out of 30 districts such as Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghapur, Balasore, Puri, Jajpur, Khordha and Cuttack districts are more flood-affected districts. As high as 77% of Bhadrak and 70% of the Kendrapara district have been categorised as flood hazard.

According to P. G. Diwakar, Director of Earth Observation, Application and Disaster Management Support Programme Office of ISRO, “A large number of satellite images acquired over 18 years (2001-2018) were used. All satellite data sets were analysed and flood layers were extracted. All the flood layers corresponding to a year are combined as one inundation layer, so that this layer represents the maximum flooded area in one year.”

‘Useful resource’

“All such combined flood layers for 18 years were integrated into flood hazard layer representing the observed flood-inundated areas with different frequencies. This layer was integrated with the digital database layers of Odisha,” said Dr. Diwakar. The atlas would serve as a useful resource of information for policy makers, planners and civil society groups, said Chief Secretary A. P.

211,2360,hyderabad,2019,https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/290919/nizam-era-drains-keep-old-city-dry.html,28 Sept 2019,Nizam era drains keep Old City dry,"Hyderabad: The century-old storm water drain system of the Nizam era has proven that even now it is much better than the modern drainage system. Old mohallas of Hyderabad are not much affected by the recent continuous rain. Rainwater only entered houses in areas colonised after 1960.

When the Musi River was flooded in 1908, the sixth Nizam, Mir Mahboob Ali Khan, appointed Mokshag-ondam Vishweshwarayya as chief adviser to avoid such havoc in future and focus on the draining of storm water. He asked him to study Hyderabad and chalk out an elaborate plan to manage the floods and for storm water management.

After his demise in 1911, the seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan, established the City Improvement Board to provide better civic facilities in the city. Later, the City Drainage Board was established in 1926.

The system is still serving efficiently despite a manifold increase in the population. During the recent incessant rain, it survived the severe force of the water. Old mohallas like Moghalpura, Khilwat, Fateh Darwaza, Chelapura, Hussaini Al-am, Sultan Shahi and Chanchalguda are areas never affected during heavy rains. In these areas, rainwater recedes in lesser time as the lines of the storm water drains and drainage drains are much deeper and wider compared with lines developed after the Nizam era.

In the Old City, only those habitations were being affected during the rain which came up either on water bodies or on the banks of nalas. Such areas include Talabkatta, Ganga Bowli, Bhavani Nagar, Salam Chowk, Falaknuma Al-Jubail Colony, Bilalnagar, Amannagar, Moula Ka Chilla.

New colonies which emerged in Tolichowki like Nizam Colony, Salar Jung Colony, MD Lines, Nadeem Colony, Al-Hasnat Colony, Al-Kareem Colony, Owaisi Colony, Akbarpura, Balreddyn-agar are most affected areas which are inundated every year.

Residents complained that the GHMC authorities do not de-silt the Balkampet nala passing through the military area.

Dr Gade Venkatesh, a sanitation expert, said Asaf Jahi rulers were keen to acquire world class facilities in their estate and always focused on high quality. Whatever they built and developed were the world’s best standards of their times. The effective working of that system shows the great vision of the Nizam who had planned keeping in mind the manifold increase in the population.

He said for effective control of drain water in the state capital, there is a need to re-design and re-vamp the drain system taking into account the future population, as the city is expanding rapidly and vastly. At present, the length of the drain canals is about 1,600 kms, which should be extended up to 5,000 kms and for that we have to have 1,1300 more manholes..

Citizens demand permanent relief

Concerned citizens of the twin cities have harked back to the 111th Anniversary of Musi Floods while demanding a master plan for a drainage system that ensures that Hyderabad and its environs are free of any rain havoc in the future.

To mark the 111th anniversary, Forum for Better Hyderabad organised a “Memorial and Solidarity Meet” under the Tamarind Tree in Afzal Park, Osmania Hospital, which saved 150 lives during the Musi floods.

President of the Forum M. Ved Kumar said after the floods in Musi River, VII Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan developed the underground drainage system utilising the services of great city planners Mokshagundam Vishw-eshwarayya and Ali Nawaz Jung. That drainage system is still working efficiently.

He said “If we want Hyderabad to be a clean and green city, we have to make Musi River clean and manage it in a systematic manner. Unless we do that, we cannot solve the problem of floods, as every nala of the city drains into the Musi.”

Ved Kumar underlined that to have a well-designed master plan for drainage, civil society will have to play a key role.

“The government has established the Musi River Front Development Corporation. We hope the government will take the initiative in quickly developing a systematic drainage system. To promote this cause, we have also established a group ‘Friends of Musi River’,” the forum president stated.

Mohammed Safiullah of the forum suggested that school syllabi should include the services of Kakatiya, Qutub Shahi and Asif Jahi rulers to the Hyderabad state. This will let them know the feats of our past rulers. We are still utilising the structures and infrastructure created by Asif Jahi rulers, he pointed out.

It was thanks to upgrades, in fact, that these vehicles could drive through the flooded streets in Kerela to provide support.

The unfortunate events during Kerela floods saw an incredible display of people coming together to help each other out. One of these came off a number SUV owners who rescued people from flood-stricken areas and ferried supplies. There was, in fact, also an announcement from the state government in which its requested 4X4 vehicle owners to step forth and assist with the situation at hand. Now though, those very SUVs and off-roaders are in trouble with RTO because they are modified to perform better off the road.

A recent government order has banned all sorts of modifications to cars and motorcycles alike. A number of SUV owners in Kerela are upset with the decision and have now written an open letter to the CM, reminding him of the assistance those modified vehicles provided in an hour of need.

In the open letter to Chief Minister of Kerala Pinarayi Vijayanarar posted on Facebook, Tisson Tharappel writes that the owners of the “so-called” modified vehicles in Kerela volunteered willfully to assist during the floods. All their vehicles are ready to face emergency situations like those during the recent floods, he added.

Tharappel pointed out that such modifications are legal in developed countries, adding that the government must be lenient with such modifications without penalising the 4×4 vehicles. “It is painful to forget that many jeep owners in Kerala used their vehicles for rescue during the floods.”

Kerela’s off-roading community has insisted the government revisit the current rule on car modifications and not include their SUVs in the category and instead consider them upgraded vehicles. They have urged the government to set up a committee to study the vehicles and suggest new norms.

Modified Cars, Bikes are illegal says Supreme Court! Not even paint, exhausts

Many of these SUVs in Kerela have raised suspension, are fitted with snorkels for deep water wading and other such upgrades. It was thanks to upgrades, in fact, that these vehicles could drive through the flooded streets in Kerela to provide support. The community was also facilitated by the State Chief Secretary for their efforts and gathered a lot of appreciation across the state and country.

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court clarified that no type of modification that alters any specification made by the manufacturer or to what is mentioned on the vehicle registration certificate will be legal. Modified vehicles are so far not being fined or challaned but the police and RTO are expected to begin a crackdown on car and bike modifications soon.",solution,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","August 8, 2018","August 21, 2018",['Kerala'],"['1144 mm in 24 hours at Aluva', '2572 mm in 48 hours at Cheruthoni', '2361 mm in 24 hours at Kothamangalam', '2304 mm in 24 hours at Kozhikode', '2133 mm in 24 hours at Ponmudi', '1972 mm in 24 hours at Peermade', '1841 mm in 24 hours at Kalpetta', '1765 mm in 24 hours at Munnar', '1708 mm in 24 hours at Thiruvananthapuram', '1680 mm in 24 hours at Idukki']","['10.07 lakh houses damaged', '80,000 km of roads damaged', '1,53,334 hectares of crops damaged', '103 bridges damaged', '1,24,447 people evacuated', '483 people killed', '14.5 lakh people affected']",,"[""Kerala's economy suffered a loss of Rs 20,000 crore"", '10 lakh people were displaced from their homes', '1000 schools and colleges were closed', '1000 villages were cut off from the rest of the state', '1000 km of roads were damaged', '100 bridges were damaged', '100000 people were evacuated', '483 people were killed']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Relief and rescue operations by the Defence forces during the Kerala floods were the theme of the Indian Navy Tableau that rolled down the Rajpath during the 70th Republic Day Parade. In keeping with the Indian Navy’s theme for the year 2019, “Indian Navy-Mission Deployed and Combat Ready”, the tableau illustrated the combat potential of the multi-dimensional Indian Navy of the 21st Century.

The Navy’s efforts in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations during operation ‘Madad’ in Kerala was showcased wherein a Dhruv helicopter was shown conducting rescue from a roof top.

The tableau also featured state of the art assets like MiG-29K multi role fighter, Rukmani Satellite, Boeing P81 Maritime Patrol aircraft, Kolkata class Ship and Kalvari class submarine.

The devastating floods in Kerala last year claimed hundreds of lives and rendered scores of people homeless. The Indian Navy conducted a 14-day-long rescue operation in the flood-hit southern State and rescued a total of 16,005 people during ‘Operation Madad’, launched on August 9 for assisting the State administration and undertaking disaster relief operations.

The Defence forces were involved in several daring rescue acts such as air-lifting a pregnant woman and winching up a two-year old which won them widespread appreciation.

In addition to the rescue of the marooned area, 10 air sorties amounting to 15 hours of flying were undertaken by various naval aircraft, mainly for air dropping of relief supplies, especially food and medicines.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted a dire, deficit monsoon this year, but the season has brought the heaviest monsoon rains India has received in 25 years. This, despite a late onset and deficient rainfall during the month of June.

New Delhi: Heavy rains over a few days in late September have caused widespread floods in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, claiming at least 148 lives. This sudden spate of rainfall marks the wettest September India has seen since 1917.

While the rainfall was more in the September of 1917, several studies on the monsoon that year point out that the rains didn’t result in major flooding as they have now.

This points to a changing trend in the Indian monsoon, where a season’s worth of rainfall is being unleashed on certain areas within a span of days. While the quantity of this rainfall may not surpass the average by much — this year’s monsoon has a 10 per cent surplus — it is still wreaking havoc, which, experts say, is now raising questions over how India measures rains.

What happened in 1917?

The rainfall surplus for September 2019 stands at 52 per cent, 13 percentage points lower than that recorded in 1917.

The measurement yardstick has changed since — while the performance of the 1917 monsoon was calculated against the average of the 60-year period from 1901 to 1960, the current benchmark is known as the ‘Long Period Average’ (LPA), which is the average rainfall received between 1951 and 2000.

According to a study published in the Hydrological Sciences Journal in 1978, the excess rain in 1917 did not cause major floods.

“Probably, this was due to the fact that the rainfall was more or less evenly distributed and there were no localised heavy spells of rain,” the authors said in the study.

The 1921 census also does not report floods, but states that 1917 was “wet and unhealthy and a virulent outbreak of plague in the north and west of India caused heavy mortality”.

It says that the heavy monsoon in 1917 led to a malaria epidemic, and “mortality from this disease was high in almost every province”.

Both these reports note that the following year, 1918, brought a disastrous dry spell — according to the 1921 census, crops failed in Punjab and central and western areas.

“Scarcity, aggravated by the high level of prices, was declared in parts of Punjab, United Provinces, Central Provinces, Bombay and Bihar and Orissa, while agricultural conditions were equally bad in parts of the Hyderabad and Mysore states,” it said.

This monsoon

During this monsoon, according to IMD data, the rains in eastern and northeastern states were 12 per cent lower than the LPA, while places like Maharashtra experienced a surplus of 55 per cent. Uttarakhand, Bihar and Assam received lower-than-LPA rains but still faced floods.

This suggests that indicators like LPAs are no longer adequate to understand the consequences of rainfall, said Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) deputy director general Chandra Bhushan. Cities are now experiencing extreme rainfall in a very short duration of time, he added.

Bihar, for example, had reported a rainfall deficit of 16 per cent until 26 September, which changed to a surplus of 3 per cent in four days.

Researchers from IIT-Madras and IIT-Bombay who examined rainfall patterns during the monsoon months — June to September — over the past century found a peculiar trend. Their findings, released in 2016, sought to disprove the traditional notion of dry areas becoming drier and wet areas becoming wetter in response to climate change.

“The major surplus basins, such as the Mahanadi, Godavari, and Brahmani, exhibit significant decreases in rainfall,” researchers wrote in the study, published in the journal PLOS One.

“The major water deficit basin, Ganga, exhibits significant increases in rainfall…, whereas the Yamuna, Krishna and Cauvery basin exhibit decreases,” they added.

“The decrease in the monsoon rainfall in the surplus river basins, which are majorly present in the core Indian monsoon zone, may be due to the drying of rivers in these region during recent decades,” they wrote.

These patterns show that areas that previously did not have to cope with excessive rainfall may now need to be equipped to do so, with the same holding true for places not used to deficit rains.

Meanwhile, another study released by IIT-Gandhinagar researchers has suggested that multi-day flood events are likely to increase at a faster rate in the future, owing to the growth in carbon emissions and strengthening climate change.

According to the team, rising temperatures increase the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere, thereby increasing rainfall events.

Need for urban planning

Bhushan said India needed a major overhaul if it wanted to avoid the disasters rains wreak year after year.

“The civil engineering handbook, which is used to design cities, has to be revised because they were designed to deal with 100-year extremes,” he added. “But those extreme events are now taking place every five or 10 years.”

According to him, watershed areas, for example drains, are no longer able to keep up with the frequent excess rain. The unplanned growth of cities, he added, made India all the more vulnerable to floods,

“In some areas, the river bodies have also silted up. For example, in Mumbai area, Mithi has silted up and does not have the same water carrying capacities (as before),” Bhushan said.

Bhushan said India is increasingly experiencing extreme weather of all kinds — be it heatwaves, droughts or floods — and our infrastructure needed to keep up.

Odisha offers a great example in this regard. After the devastating cyclone of 1999, which claimed over 10,000 lives in the state, massive efforts were made over the years to bolster its preparedness.

As a result, the toll from Cyclone Fani, which made landfall this May and was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike the state since 1999, was less than 90.

The case of 1917 and 1918, when excess rainfall was followed by a dry spell, shows that even without climate change and global warming being a factor, India is prone to extreme weather fluctuations. Climate change can only aggravate such erratic climate patterns.

The north-eastern part of Malappuram district, particularly Nilambur and neighbouring regions, were submerged since Wednesday night following incessant rain for the last three days.

The entire Nilambur town is inundated with hundreds of houses, shops and business establishments being submerged. Water rose to two-metre level in some places. A red alert has been sounded for Malappuram district.

Hundreds of people were shifted to safer places. When many moved to their relatives’ houses, some others were shifted to relief camps. A large number of people who went to the second floor of their houses are trapped there. Rescue officials said many refused to leave their houses, hoping that the flood waters would recede.

The Calicut-Nilambur-Gudalur (CNG) Road was cut off as much of it was inundated in Nilambur municipal area. People in Karulai, Chungathara and Edakkara regions too have been living in fear as the downpour continued through out Thursday morning. The Chaliyar panchayat has been marooned in the floods.

A few landslips were reported in the Nilambur forest regions on Wednesday night. M.A. Gafoor, Nilambur Fire Station Officer, said a massive landslip occurred at Mundakkadavu Colony near Karulai and caused the Chaliyar to swell.

Mr. Gafoor warned the people living on the banks of the Chaliyar at Vazhakkad, Edavannappara, Vazhayoor, Areekode to maintain vigil against rising waters.

P.V. Anvar, MLA of Nilambur, said efforts were on to reach out to people trapped in houses. He said the government was doing everything possible to help the people.

200 rescued from tribal colony

As many as 200 families of Mundakkayam tribal colony near Karulai were shifted to rescue camps. A disaster management team is at the colony supervising the rescue operations.

Heavy rain has caused flash floods in Sirivella, Gospadu, Mahanandi, Nandyal, and Rudravaram mandals in Kurnool district in the early hours of Monday. While no deaths have been reported, the authorities expect significant crop and property damage.

According to the data received from the Revenue Department, Sirivella mandal received 227.6 millimetres (mm) of rain, Gospadu 226.4 mm, Rudravaram 180 mm, Mahanandi 168.4 mm and Allagadda 119 mm.

The local streams and rivers swelled, causing the flash floods. The authorities have quickly swung into action and started flood relief works in the morning.

Superintendent of Police Fakeerappa Kaginelli said that five additional teams of district special forces were deployed to the inundated areas to help in evacuation of affected people.

“The special forces are also trained in disaster response and evacuation. A total of 60 people are currently deployed, 12 per team,” he said.

The fire department has also sent out 23 men, 12 from Nandyal and eight from Allagadda. “We also used a boat during our rescue operations in Gospadu,” said District Fire Officer Srinivas Reddy.

Large parts of the district remain flooded on Friday as heavy rain continues. Nearly 3,000 people belonging to 850 families were shifted to 42 relief camps functioning in Palakkad, Alathur, Chittur, Mannarkkad, Pattambi and Ottappalam taluks.

Although torrential rain in hilly regions unleashed a wave of landslips, including those in Attappady, no casualty was reported from anywhere.

A large number of people living in vulnerable areas had been shifted to safer places.

Most rivers in the district, particularly the Bharatapuzha, the Kalpathipuzha and the Kunthipuzha, were overflowing dangerously. Those living on the banks of the rivers have been asked to move to safer places.

Several housing colonies in Palakkad town have been submerged. People were evacuated in boats. A tremor was reported at Vattappara in Palakkayam village of Mannarkkad taluk. The authorities, however, said that it was not serious. A team of geologists have begun a study there.

The bridge across the Bharatapuzha at Pattambi was closed as the swollen river began to overflow. Attappady was isolated following heavy rain that lasted for five days. Roads to Attappady were closed as they posed danger to vehicles.

Shutters of Kanjirapuzha and Mangalam dams were raised to 100 cm, releasing more water into the canals. People living on the banks of rivers and canals have been asked to maintain vigil against flooding.

The water level in dams in Palakkad district rose threateningly on Friday. Officials at Malampuzha said shutters of the dam would be opened if the rain continued on Saturday.

The Malampuzha dam has 115.06 metres storage capacity. The dam registered 109.23 metre water level on Friday morning. If the water level reaches 112.95 metres, the shutters of the dam will be opened.

Train services between Palakkad and Kozhikode were affected as the tracks were flooded at Parali. Heavy soil erosion took place at Karakkad, near Pattambi, posing threat to the tracks.

Landslips took place at different places of Anangan Mala, near Ottappalam. Several families were shifted from the areas of Varod, Cheenikkaparamba, Ambalappara, Melur and Bharatappara. Though several houses were damaged, no casualty was reported.

Though rainfall activity eased over the weekend, it has led to massive destruction. The government is still assessing the damage from the rains, which led to floods and landslides in the state still recovering from last year’s devastating floods which killed about 400 people and damaged ₹35,000 crore worth of properties.

According to the disaster management cell, the northern district of Malappuram has so far been the worst hit this monsoon season, with 58 people dead and 13 missing. Dozens of families and their livelihoods were swept away when a landslide hit Malappuram’s Kavalappara region following heavy rains. Six bodies were recovered from the site, one from just a kilometer away from the landslide’s origin.

The Kerala government has pressed a ground-penetrating radar system from Hyderabad’s National Geophysical Research Institute into service to search for missing people at the site.

The floods have destroyed 1,789 houses, with another 14,542 having suffered partial damages. Rebuilding efforts have started, with the state having announced a compensation package of ₹4 lakh for all deceased and ₹10,000 immediate assistance to about 3 lakh people, about 1% of the state’s total population of 33 million, who were displaced.

Five pet dogs owned by a woman of Nedumkayam tribal colony, near Nilambur, have survived the floods that submerged the colony, and given us one of the biggest lessons of coexistence and beneficence.

The dogs took care of the 47 goats and a brood of hens reared by Janaki Amma. The dogs became the guardian angels for the flock of goats as the entire colony remained under water for four days.

Exposed to the elements, the dogs, goats and hens starved together for four days.

When floodwaters rose, the dogs guided the goats to higher grounds.

The dogs carried the four goat kids in their mouth to higher places to save them from drowning.

Janaki Amma and her family had to leave their house in neck-deep water when the rains opened their floodgates on August 8. She was forced to leave her 47 goats, five dogs, and the brood of hens back in the floods. But she left their cages open. When she returned home from the relief camp after four days, the dogs, goats and hens were seen huddled together. “All of them were very hungry, almost on the verge of collapse. Yet, they took care of each other, giving us one of the biggest lessons of camaraderie,” said Sally Varma, Humane Society International (HIS) outreach coordinator, who examined the animals and provided 100 kg goat feed and 50 kg dog food.

Janaki Amma’s son Kalesh said that his family had faith in their dogs that they would not only stay away from causing any harm to the goats but also protect them from the floodwaters the best possible way they could.

Lesson

“It was an amazing sight of coexistence we ought to learn from them. When I brought them food, all three groups were seen eating voraciously from the same container,” said Ms. Varma.

The HIS reached out to the tribal family with animal food at a time when no dog food or goat feed was available in the markets around, most of which were ravaged by the floods. “When we approached, Janaki Amma accepted the food for the animals alone. She refused to accept anything for her family. ,” said Ms. Varma.",flood,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","August 8, 2019","August 18, 2019",Malappuram,100 mm,"47 goats, 5 dogs, and a brood of hens",0,The dogs guided the goats to higher grounds.

26 Sep 2019

During the fag end of 2015, Chennai experienced severe floods resulting in the death of about 500 people and economic losses of about INR 50,000 crores. The flooding stranded the city and was termed a 'man-made disaster' resulting from irresponsible water management and rapid urbanisation. The northeast monsoon of the year left most parts of South India marooned, exposing how vulnerable our cities are to such catastrophes.

""That's when the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser took a major initiative to develop a real-time, integrated, urban flood forecasting system that was non-existent in our country. It called for a meeting of experts among multiple government agencies and academia,"" recalls Prof Subimal Ghosh. He is currently a Professor at the Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay).

Soon after, with a team of scientists from various institutes across the country, he swung into action to develop the first-ever expert system in India to forecast floods.

An expert system is a computer-based program that makes decisions and predictions based on a set of data. The researchers designed the flood forecasting system in a record year and a half.

""It was highly interdisciplinary, and a team of 30 scientists from 8 institutions took the responsibility. I led the project, and this is one of the best learning experiences of my life,"" shares Prof Ghosh.

In a recent study, published in the journal Current Science, the researchers shed light on the development of the automated flood forecasting expert system. The study was funded by the Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India and had a committee of experts chaired by Dr Shailesh Nayak, Ex-Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES). The research team comprised of scientists from the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, IIT Madras, Anna University, India Meteorological Department (IMD), National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), Noida, National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), Chennai, Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad, and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Hyderabad.

The expert system designed by the researchers has six components—some running in parallel and a few dependent on each other. It has computational models that can forecast regional weather and surges in the tides and storm. It also has data from sensors that measures water levels in the rivers. Hydrological models, which consider reservoirs and river flows, are also included in the system, along with flood models that calculate which areas would be inundated. The system produces visual maps of forecasted inundation. All these components are automated and need no manual intervention at any stage.

The data for the expert system include rainfall and weather parameters; tidal and ocean depth data obtained from the Adyar, Cooum and Kosasthalaiyar river mouths in Chennai; water levels in these rivers; reservoir levels of Chembarambakkam and Poondi reservoirs; historical rainfall data, and the current land use, topography and drainage data. The output is an inundation forecast of 6-72 hours with ward-wise three-dimensional maps showing the depth of the predicted flooding and its area.

The complex calculations based on these parametres happen in a jiffy in the expert system.

""Normally NCMRWF releases the forecasts at 3 PM, and within the next two hours, our expert system will release the first forecast for the next three days,"" shares Prof Ghosh. ""If there is a forecast of heavy floods, the real-time computing operations start, and the forecast will be updated every 6 hours,"" he explains. The level of details thus obtained can help rescue and alert operations.

The expert system also has a databank to speed up the process of forecasting. It has 796 scenarios resulting from rainfall extremes with different severity of water flow and tides, and past rainfall.

""Flood simulations for large cities take a very long time. Hence, we have generated the extreme possible cases in a data bank,"" reasons Prof Ghosh. As soon as the input forecasts arrive, a search algorithm finds the closest scenario from the data bank and releases the first forecast.

The researchers have validated their system with data from the December 2015 floods. They found that their inundation map with flood depths was 80% accurate within one metre as compared to the real flooded regions.

""We also experimentally verified its performance during the winter monsoon in Chennai, and found that it was working well,"" says Prof Ghosh.

Currently, the entire expert system is transferred to NCCR, Chennai, which is maintaining it. It is now working on an experimental basis and will be fully operational after a year. The researchers believe that their system can also be used for flood forecasting in other cities too.

""This is quite a robust framework, and MoES is using it for developing a similar forecast system in Mumbai. We are delighted that MoES finds our approach very useful and is implementing for other cities,"" concludes Prof Ghosh.

This article has been run past the researchers, whose work is covered, to ensure accuracy.

Karnataka continues to reel under heavy downpour and floods that have crippled the daily life of people in northern parts of the state.

According to reports, the outflow from the reservoirs of the Krishna basin caused the inundation of several villages and farmlands. The rainfall also led to the disruption of train and bus services from cities like Bengaluru, Hubli-Dharwad towards Uttara Kannada, Raichur, Yadgir, Bagalkot and Belagavi districts.

Meanwhile, the train services between Londa in Belagavi and Tinaighat in Uttara Kannada had been suspended from 1 am on Tuesday morning until further notice. Advertisement The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) confirmed that all interstate buses bound for Mumbai and Pune are operating until Nippani due to a blockage on National Highway 4. According to reports, the route between Ankola and Yellapur in Uttara Kannada district is also blocked after heavy rainfall. Connection to Hyderabad, Pune and Hubballi will be affected. The buses are now being operated via Sirsi. After the high quantum of outflow from Basavasagar reservoir, six islands remained cut off and two key bridges were submerged in Yadgir district. The alarming water level across the Chikkapadasalagi bridge has resulted in a ban on the movement of heavy vehicles.

The ‘Room for the River’ model adopted at Noordwaard in the Netherlands to tackle flooding and ensure the safety of local people will be incorporated in the Rebuild Kerala initiative.

At a press conference here on Monday on his return after the 13-day tour to Europe, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the project, aimed at giving the river more room and thus managing water level during floods, can be replicated in low-lying Kuttanad and Alappuzha.

Describing the tour to the Netherlands, Switzerland, France, and the U.K. as ‘highly successful and beneficial’ to the State, Mr. Vijayan said many projects would be executed by his government through collaboration.

Kerala and the Netherlands would collaborate in several areas, including water management, agriculture, waste management, and maritime sector.

With Rotterdam port

Chief Secretary Tom Jose had been asked to coordinate steps to diversify agriculture, increase the shelf life of plantain in association with Wageningen University, promote ecotourism, and rejuvenate the coir sector. The State intended to enter into a pact on maritime cooperation with the authorities of the Rotterdam port, the biggest in Europe, in October.

Preserving records

Mr. Vijayan said VNO-NCW, the Confederation of Netherlands’ Industry and Employers, had evinced interest in working for Kerala’s development. Representatives of Dutch companies and Chairman of VNO-NCW would be invited to the State.

The Netherlands would collaborate with the State for preserving Dutch records and a memorandum of understanding once approval is received from the Ministry of External Affairs. An exhibition would be held in Kochi on Indo-Dutch relations this year.

The Chief Secretary would hold discussions with Dutch companies Zonta Global and Paques on waste disposal and waste-to-energy projects.

More global aid

The Chief Minister said Kerala’s participation in the World Reconstruction Conference (WRC4) in Geneva had paved way for more international assistance for the State.

A business delegation from Switzerland would come to Kerala and a team from the State would visit that country to attract investment.

On the talks with French economist Thomas Piketty, the Chief Minister said Mr. Piketty was keen on studying the Kerala Model and a nodal officer would be appointed to make data available. “This is a big recognition for the State,” Mr. Vijayan said.",solution,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","August 8, 2018","August 20, 2018",All districts of Kerala,300 mm,"Rs. 20,000 crore",483,10 million people affected,One of the worst floods in Kerala's history,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

A total of 420 villages across 40 mandals were affected in both those areas due to incessant rains which started on 31 July. The heavy downpour has cut-off transportation to several villages, while others have been submerged.

According to the AP Disaster Management Authority (APDMA), several teams of the State Disaster Response Force, National Disaster Response Force and Fire department have been deployed in the affected areas to help citizens. Majority of those affected by the floods are from the East Godavari district, around 87,350, while 26,047 people are affected in the West Godavari district. A total of 17,737 homes have been marooned, according to a press release issued by the APDMA on Tuesday.

Apart from eight villages being submerged due to floods, transportation to 64 villages was cut-off in the East Godavari district. Similarly in the West Godavari district, transportation to 48 villages was cut-off, while another eight villages were completely surrounded by water, according to the release. Responding to the situation, the AP government has also set up medical camps, apart from distributing essential commodities for the affected families.

In total since 31 July, 18,809 persons were shifted to 85 relief camps in East Godavari districts, while 133 people were shifted to two relief camps in the West Godavari district. However, the total number of affected people, who were not shifted to relief camps, and suffered property damages, are believed to be much higher. An AP government official however could not provide numbers about the same.

After the calamity, the AP government passed an order on 3 August to provide 25 kilograms of rice, two litres of kerosene, one Kg of red gram, one litre of palm oil, one Kg onions and 1 Kg of potatoes for the affected families in both districts. However, so far, no casualties have been reported since 31 July from both coastal Andhra districts.

An APSDMA official said moderate to heavy rainfall was expected in both districts (and in some other places of Andhra Pradesh as well) for 24 hours starting Tuesday, and added that the situation was being constantly monitored.

Rampant urbanisation in the Vasai-Virar belt has made it more prone to floods over the last decade, a study conducted by students of Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute of Architecture (KRVIA) shows. The study highlighted that between 2004 and 2019 the share of urban areas went up from 12% to 20% in the 380 sq.km. region.

The study showed that the increased concretisation resulted in cutting-off of natural streams originating from the hills on the east and flowing towards the coast. These streams functioned as a natural source of drainage to run-off water during monsoons. The team of 12 students, all pursuing their master’s, studied the area over four months and analysed its land-use pattern and water systems.

In July 2018, large parts of Vasai and Virar were submerged for a week following heavy rains. The city was cut-off from other parts of the State and Gujarat as there was severe waterlogging on the tracks. Railway officials said there was a drainage issue as water levels did not recede even after the rain stopped.

The study also noted that due to rampant urbanisation, groundwater levels in the region had depleted severely, resulting in an ingress of salt water from the sea. As a result, agricultural communities, traditionally dependent on wells, have been getting non-potable water for agricultural purposes.

The study was part of ‘Building Resilient Urban Communities’ (BReUCom), a joint studio project between KRVIA and seven other institutes in India and abroad. Other student teams belonging to first and second year master’s programmes have developed similar studies on various communities and spaces in the city such as Diva, Mumbra, informal settlements along Gazdarbandh nullah and the Kalbadevi-Bora Bazaar precinct.

The State of Kerala, which is known for its rich and diverse natural heritage did not have to face natural calamities of significant magnitude since 1924. But the recent unprecedented floods of August 2018, posed a new and a major challenge to our Government and the civil society.

Kerala was very badly affected by this flood in which there was loss of 453 precious human lives. In addition, 280 thousand houses were lost or damaged, 140 thousand hectares of standing crops were destroyed and about 70 thousand kilometres of road network suffered major damage. The total recovery needs of the State has been estimated at ₹31,000 crores as per the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) conducted by the UN Agencies.

But our society met this with exemplary determination. The spirit of courage, especially among the youth and students has its roots in the uniqueness of Kerala society due to the imbibing of the values of famous renaissance movement, which took place in our society in the last two centuries. The secular fabric of our society ensured that no differences could stand in the way of meeting this natural calamity challenge.

The fisher-folk who brave the sea for a livelihood deserve our special gratitude for their timely intervention without which we would have lost many more lives. Rescue of people trapped in houses and moving them to safer places was the top priority and this was done effectively with societal participation as mentioned earlier.

Affected families were given immediate relief in cash and kind. Critical infrastructure like power supply was restored in record time. The State Government in cooperation with Local Government institutions, civil society and mass organisations organised a massive drive for cleaning flood affected houses, provision of drinking water, medicines and essential supplies.

A comprehensive programme to rebuild lost and damaged houses has been launched. Loans for recovery of essential house-hold articles lost and damaged during the floods from our Co-operative Banks and commercial banks where channelised through the widely networked Women’s self help group Kudumbashree. The interest payment on these loans was borne by the Government of Kerala. Our Government also ensured wage employment to needy families by augmenting the ongoing employment programme. Our Government is also providing financial assistance with beneficiary involvement for rebuilding damaged houses and constructing completely lost houses. Kerala which accords a pride of place to education gave priority to the post flood problems faced by our students who where given new text books and note books. Camps were also held to speedily reissue lost certificates.

We have presently taken up the challenging task of rebuilding Kerala better. In other words, our aim is not to restore what was in existence before the flood, but to build a new Kerala which will be resilient to any possible natural disasters in future.

The Rebuild Kerala Initiative is being carried out in a mission mode adopting the latest available technologies. Eco-friendly building strategies, giving more room for rivers, learning to live with floods etc. are the key ingredients of this initiative. Kerala which has a long history of implementing social security measures and several progressive interventions like land reforms, state action in education and health, expects to fulfil the present task also through peoples’ participation. For this, the strong institutional framework of decentralisation of governance will be of great support.

In the first week of May 2019 the cyclone Fani badly affected the Indian State Odisha. But damage to human life could be controlled due to sufficient early warning. This brings before us the fact that early warning systems should work effectively as the variations in

climatic patterns due to global warming have increased the frequency of natural calamities like floods and cyclones.

I wholeheartedly support the theme of the World Reconstruction Conference being held now at Geneva, which is “Opportunities to build back more inclusively include identifying vulnerable groups and their needs prior to a disaster, social protection programs that target the most vulnerable and ensuring that reconstruction does not overlook low-income and geographically-isolated areas.”. The floods of 2018 brought the best of Kerala out – sinking all differences we acted unison. This spirit will continue to inspire us through all our recovery efforts.

The motivation to rebuild Kerala by guarding its eco-system and ensuring that no one is left behind is the force behind our rebuild initiative. We have formulated policies with regard to holistic management of water resources by resolving to constitute a River Basin Authority which will be a gain changer in water resource management policy. The technical personnel will no longer be construction engineers, but custodians of a health river. Our Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) policy will be in place shortly. In this we plan to protect lives and property along with a determined decision to provide more room for the river.

In implementing the rebuild initiative which will make our State resilient to any natural disaster in future, people’s participation is our main strength.

We have three strong pillars which support us – a vibrant civil society which sinks differences and springs into action in times of crisis, strong mass organisations of various sections of the society which can mobilise a large number of people for action and a caring Government which acts swiftly and in accordance with the needs of the people. These have helped us to successfully come out of these three crises.

Heavy rain continued to lash Raigad on Sunday, while Navi Mumbai had some respite from showers.

By Saturday night, Morbe dam at Khalapur and Hetawane dam at Pen were full, and all gates of both dams were opened. While water from Morbe dam will flow into the Dhavari river, that from Hetawane will join the Bhogeshwari river.

Navi Mumbai recorded 34.55 mm rainfall on Sunday as compared to 96.72 mm on Saturday. Raigad district recorded rainfall of 252.42 mm as compared to 165.45 mm on Saturday.

Pen and Alibaug were battered by 493 mm and 331 mm rain respectively. “Some senior citizens from Sai Nagar and Bavan Bunglow in Panvel had to be rescued from their residences using boats,” Panvel fire officer Anil Jadhav said.

Meanwhile, a tree fell on the compound wall of Ryan International School in Kharghar. “The compound wall collapsed. Fortunately, it was a Sunday and nno students were around. The vehicular movement was disrupted from 8.40 a.m. till afternoon. The fire brigade cleared the road,” Shivdas Parasur, a nearby resident who witnessed the incident, said.

Due to flooding on Borghar bridge in Alibaug, Ramraj village, with a population of 2,000, lost land connectivity. Raigad District Collector Vijay Suryawanshi said, “Close to 350 people have been rescued from Pen and Nagothane by the NDRF. We have told citizens to store all necessary items at home and to stay alert. And if they see water level rising, they should move to a safer place.”

In Roha and Mangaon, 63 people were rescued to a safer place, while around 45 people staying at Borgaon Tadvadi in Khalapur were shifted due to a chance of landslides. Two plants at Reliance Industries Limited in Rasayani were shut after water from Patalganga river entered the premises.

Search called off

The search operation to find the fourth student who drowned near Pandavkada waterfall in Kharghar on Saturday was called off on Sunday evening. “An extensive search was conducted by the fire brigade and local groups from the morning, but there was no sign of the fourth student.

The torrential rain that tapered off on Friday morning, picked up intensity in the afternoon, raising fears of escalation of the flood situation in areas lying on the banks of the Valapattanam river and its tributaries.

The relief felt in the morning when the water level of the overflowing rivers and tributaries started receding after the intensity of the rain reduced was replaced by concern as the rain gathered strength by afternoon. The situation became grim as overflowing rivers breached the banks and flooded nearby areas. Several families were evacuated from Pamburuthi and Koralayi, river islands here in the morning as the houses and roads were flooded. Residents were taken on canoes to safer places.

Parts of Iritty town experienced flooding by the afternoon.

The rise of the water level upstream of the Valapattanam river caused concern that the flood situation in the affected areas would worsen. Low-lying areas on the banks of the river at Kakkathuruthi near Kattampally, Chengalayi and Kambil were flooded in the morning. Residents were shifted to safer places on canoes. Several houses in these areas were inundated. A 71-year-old man was found dead at a flooded bus shelter at Vallithode near Iritty in the morning. The deceased was identified as Joy, a native of nearby Kolithattu. With this, the number of deaths caused by flooding rose to two. A 54-year-old man drowned near Mattannur on August 8.

As many as 3,877 people have been shifted to 48 relief camps opened in the district. The areas worst affected by the flooding are in Iritty taluk. As many as 2,274 people living in affected areas in the taluk were shifted to relief camps. In Taliparamba taluk, 1,032 people were moved to relief camps. The number of people shifted to the relief camps in Kannur and Thalassery taluks is 298 and 273 respectively.

Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan, who is in charge of the relief operations in the district, visited the district on Friday. A press release said that he would chair an emergency meeting of the District Disaster Management Authority at the Collector’s chamber here at 8 p.m. to review the losses caused by the flooding and the rescue and relief operations.

Meanwhile, the public has been urged to contribute clothes and materials to be sent to relief camps. The things required include bed sheets, clothes, sanitary napkins, food items and candle, among others.

Twenty people have been killed in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts, and nine have died in Wayanad in rain related incidents since August 8, officials said quoting reports received till 7 am.

In 988 relief camps across the state, 1,07,699 persons have been shifted. In the worst affected Wayanad, 24,990 persons are in such camps, they said.

Many people are still feared trapped under debris following major landslides that hit the Wayanad and Malappuram districts and the rescue operations, which were suspended Friday night, have restarted as the day broke, the officials said.

Heavy rain is continuing in Wayanad, hampering the rescue efforts, the officials said.

Over 1,000 people have been rescued from the tea plantation village of Puthumala at Meppadi in Wayanad, which was rocked by landslides as portion of a hill came crashing down on several homes and other structures, including a mosque and a temple.

According to Wayanad Sub Collector N S K Umesh, seven bodies have been recovered so far and over 1,000 people have been moved to safer locations.

""The area is dangerous. What we understand is that 15 people are still missing,"" he said, adding search operations by Army and National Disaster Response Force personnel are underway. With water levels rising, there is a possibility of opening the shutters of Banasurasagar dam, officials have indicated.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said on Friday that the dam could be opened any time. The district administration is likely to take a decision in this regard after reviewing the situation this morning.

Besides Wayanad, the continuous rains have triggered multiple landslides and overflowing rivers have caused flooding in several parts of Malappuram, Kannur and Idukki in north and central Kerala.

Several areas in Thrissur and Kannur districts are waterlogged with many having been moved to relief camps. Train services have also been disrupted due to flooding and trees falling on rail tracks.

Southern Railways has cancelled several trains, including the Kannur-Alapuzha Express, on Saturday. Many trains have been partially cancelled with routes cut short to avoid the flooded areas.

243,2392,hyderabad,2019,https://www.dawn.com/news/1498090,5 Aug 2019,The blessing and pain of rain,"The annual monsoon season is upon us again with its early effects bringing back haunting memories of past floods. It began this year with torrential rains and urban flooding in the southern parts, including the country’s largest city, Karachi, and areas in nearby Hyderabad.

In Karachi alone, more than 20 precious lives were lost to urban flooding and with electrocution. Key parts of the port city remained without electricity for extended periods, even going beyond 48 hours.

Then followed the usual blame game. Federal ministers blamed the provincial government for misusing funds provided by the centre and turning deaf ears to its advisories regarding the removal of bottlenecks from nullahs, with the provincial government passing the buck to the city government and vice versa.

The effects of rains were, nevertheless, limited to urban areas, mostly because of poor drainage and sewerage system besides ill-planned and unregulated urban development and constructions in the water pathways.

The rains also exposed the vulnerable distribution network of the K-Electric (KE) and Hyderabad Electric Supply Company. As the regulator issued a notice raising question marks on its performance, the private power utility has started the process to declare force majeure, a legal process to protect itself against any penalty or adverse action on grounds that problems emerged due to exogenous factors.

Pakistan has suffered losses worth $19 billion owing to floods between 1947 and 2009 and another $19bn in direct losses since the 2010 floods

The regulator has sent a four-member investigation team to Karachi and Hyderabad “to assess the factual position with regard to the failure of supply and subsequent casualties and other problems caused by recent heavy rains”.

A KE spokesman said the company was still focusing on restoration works and removal of bottlenecks as of Friday and had not yet been able to quantify damages to its own installations. Some areas are still underwater and it is difficult to assess at this stage how many transformers, feeders or other equipment could be repaired or need to be replaced, he said.

Heavy rains were also reported in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan that caused loss of human lives and public properties. The season is still half-way through and it is premature to reach any conclusions.

But given the advance warning signs raised by the weather pundits and federal flood commission as early as March, it would not be unreasonable to find relevant provincial and federal agencies and utilities wanting to take precautions. This is all the more important given the devastations caused by the 2010 heavy floods and then in the following years with varying degrees.

The Ministry of Water Resources and the chief engineering organisation of the federal government had warned the parliamentarians in March that Pakistan could face a ‘major’ to ‘super flood’ during the monsoon season owing to higher than normal snowfall and snow deposits on mountains and other climatic changes this year.

According to the Ministry of Water Resources, Pakistan has suffered losses worth $19 billion due to flooding between 1947 and 2009 and another $19bn direct losses since 2010 floods because of higher population.

The weather forecast even in June and early part of July were in line with the above assessment until the third week of July when the situation changed due to an extraordinary high pressure development in the Arabian Gulf region, acting as a blockage for the flow of cool western winds towards South Asia.

Since the start of monsoon early last month, the National Disaster Management Authority has reported a total of 104 deaths and 83 injured across the country. This is despite the fact that the downpour, fortunately, did not take place continuously as it happened in 2010 which cost about 2,000 lives and disturbed around 20 million people one way or the other. The intensity of rains this time has also not been as grave in Northern parts of the country.

On top of that, there was enough storage capacity in dams following water shortages in early Kharif that helped the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) to conserve maximum river flows in both major dams. The heavy but staggered rainfall in the upper catchments emerged as a divine blessing in disguise.

Yet, 400 households were affected in KP, a few bridges were washed away, roads and water supply to Chitral were blocked and a few powerhouses damaged. In Azad Kashmir, 120 houses, 40 shops and two mosques were damaged. In addition, another 182 houses in other parts of the country were fully or partially damaged.

No major loss has so far been reported to the agriculture sector anywhere in the country except some minor losses after a canal near Hyderabad was damaged. In fact, rains were timely for crops in Sindh and Punjab, according to a senior official at the Ministry Of National Food Security And Research.

According to director operations of Irsa Khalid Idrees Rana, there was no abnormality in rivers. Instead, he wished for a couple of healthy peak flows in river Jhelum so that Mangla dam could be filled before Rabi season. He said the good thing about this year’s rain was that major rainfall systems are coming with reasonable breaks, allowing its drainage and absorption without any damage, unlike back-to-back downpours that cause rapid flooding.

He said Tarbela and Mangla dams still had about 16 feet and 50 feet storage capacity available as of August 2. Total storage at about 9.2 million acre feet was almost 68 per cent of the total capacity. He said Tarbela dam had been filled to 1,534 feet and was now being filled two-feet every day to be followed by one-foot a day after 1,540 feet in line with dam safety standards.

But the situation at Mangla dam was not that encouraging. If there are a few good showers of rain in September as predicted, the water shortage could reduce by 5-7pc, otherwise there are estimates of over 15-17pc shortage.

(Representational Image)

As heavy rains pound several states across India throwing life out of gear, environment experts have blamed climate change and rising global temperature for an erratic rainfall pattern which has claimed over 100 lives.

While some experts stress on reducing carbon footprint, some feel it is not a natural phenomenon but a result of unplanned construction.

Several parts of India are currently facing severe flooding as a result of unusually heavy monsoon rain, with the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar particularly affected.

Nearly 110 people have died in the last five days. While 79 people have died in UP, 28 lives have been lost in Bihar.

Tarun Gopalakrishnan, climate policy researcher at the Centre for Science and Environment, said there was a need to reduce carbon emissions as climate change was resulting in erratic rains.

“Climate change is resulting in more erratic rainfall patterns, including a large portion of seasonal rainfall being concentrated in a limited number of days, leading to flooding. Limiting the human cost of this trend will require drastically cutting carbon emissions around the globe, while investing in adaptation for the new climate reality,” he said.

Scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) believe that the rise in global and local temperatures have contributed to the observed anomalies in rainfall.

“Parts of Bihar and the Uttar Pradesh-Uttarakhand belt already exhibit a rising trend in terms of the number of heavy rainfall events. Though we cannot pinpoint each event to climate change unless we do in-depth attribution study, it is likely that the rise in global and local temperatures have contributed to observed anomalies in rainfall,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, Co-Author of IPCC’s special report on oceans and cryosphere.

“Specifically, widespread heavy rains resulting in floods are on a rise across the central and west coast, and parts of north/north-east India,” he said

Another co-author of the report, Anjal Prakash, said in the last week of September 2019, many parts of peninsular India (Hyderabad and Pune), coastal region (Kolkata, Gujarat, Goa, Machilipatnam and Vizag) and sub-Himalayan region (Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Bihar, West Bengal, Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh) received heavy downpour that is wreaking havoc.

“These areas have received rains unprecedented in recent history. The recent IPCC report has forecasted these variations due to changes in the ocean and cryosphere. More than 100 climate scientists have been involved in preparing the report that states the current knowledge on these climatic events by assessing more than 7000 published work,” Prakash said.

“Massive and unprecedented flood events will occur due to warming up of oceans leading to severity of extraordinary cyclonic events,” Prakash said.

However, an official from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) believed that the act of unplanned developmental activities carried out by humans was causing the havoc.

Refusing to blame climate change for the devastating floods occurring in the country, Anand Kumar Sharma, Deputy Director of Meteorology, IMD, said, the “real issue is change in land use and encroachments”.

“Climate change can be linked very easily but one has to see these real issues. The real issue is change in land use, land cover and unplanned development taking place in these areas. When river plains will be encroached upon and unplanned development will take place, then these calamities are bound to occur. People are building houses even in rivers plains now,” Sharma said.

According to a climate science and policy institute based in Germany, the world has so far heated about 1°C since pre-industrial times and, around the world, heavy rainfall has increased.

An analysis found that there has been a threefold increase in widespread extreme rainfall over central India since 1950, as a result of warming in the northern Arabian Sea and that rainstorms in north India have become 50 per cent more common.

The trend of more unpredictable and extreme rainfall in India reflects what scientists predict will happen due to climate change, particularly if emissions do not fall.

Temperature rise is likely to make India’s summer monsoon much more unpredictable, according to the World Bank.

It also says that continued high emissions would mean a monsoon so extreme it currently happens only once a century would instead happen once a decade.

246,2395,hyderabad,2019,https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/water/a-monsoon-after-two-droughts-65342,28 Jun 2019,A monsoon after two droughts,"In a year of severe drought, India witnessed one of its worst floods

For a Down To Earth journalist, chasing the monsoon is a round the year job. At the beginning of May, the newsroom starts to feel the arrival of the monsoon, much before the India Meteorological Department (IMD) comes out with its annual forecast, and monsoon clouds Indian sub-continent boundaries.

Phone calls are made to scientists, both in India and outside; the library is put under much stress to follow recent scientific studies on monsoon; and weather folklores are re-interpreted to get a tentative answer to a question that everybody in India wants to know: Will the monsoon be normal?

This question often assumes desperate proportion. Like in 2016. For the two preceding years, India reeled under severe droughts that impacted over 400 million people. For the 0.2 million villages without any water sources inside their geographical boundaries, hope of a good monsoon in 2016 was the most precious commodity.

IMD granted this wish and announced that the 2016 monsoon would be above normal. But, what does it mean? Monsoon is the meteorological equivalent of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. As focus shifted to harvesting the maximum water from a normal monsoon in three years, there was something happening in the north-eastern part of India that blatantly delivered a message everybody ignored. By the end of August, some 20 states reported floods, most of them breaking historic records in intensity.

Nobody took notice when floods hit Assam in April 2016. A new government was just sworn in and the media did not pay much heed to the unusually high pre-monsoon rain. Everyone thought the rising waters of the Burhidehing and Desang rivers would subside. It did not happen. The flood continued till the end of August, covering more than 90 per cent of the state and affecting over four million people.

“The 2016 pre-monsoon rainfall was very strong, both in terms of the absolute rainfall and its geographical coverage,” says DC Goswami, former head of the Department of Environmental Science, Guwahati University. According to the National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad, heavy rains in the fourth week of April caused the first “wave” of floods in Assam.

Experts say the heavy pre-monsoon showers have provided the clinching evidence of the increasing frequency of western disturbances that bring the rain. According to the regional meteorological centre, Guwahati, rainfall in the state was 21 per cent above normal in March-April.

What is frightening is the fact that such unusual rain will become more common with climate change. “It is the pre-monsoon showers, rather than the monsoon, which will increase because of global warming,” says Subashisa Dutta, professor at the Department of Civil Engineering, IIT-Guwahati. In 2012, Dutta studied the impact of climate change on floods in the middle Brahmaputra region and found that the peak discharges from the river, the average duration of a flood wave and the intensity of pre-monsoon showers are likely to rise during 2071-2100.

It is quite ironic that Assam witnessed floods when its total monsoon rainfall between June 1 and August 16 was 25 per cent below normal. So, what caused the flood? Data suggests that most floods were preceded by extreme rainfall events (see ‘Under water’). imd divides extreme rainfall events into two categories: rainfall of 124.5-244.4 mm in 24 hours is “very heavy” and rainfall more than that is “extremely heavy”. In July alone, Assam recorded six “very heavy” rainfall days. By July 25, the Central Water Commission (CWC) had declared moderate floods in three districts of the state where the Beki, Sankosh and Brahmaputra rivers were flowing above the danger mark.

Arup Kumar Sarma, professor at the department of civil engineering, IIT-Guwahati, says the 2016 floods were unusual in another way: They seem to have caused more damage. “This is because the direction of the storm and the direction of flow of the river was the same. In such a situation, rains directly contribute to the rise in water levels,” he explains.

However, there is not enough long-term data to claim that extreme rainfall events have increased over the years. For instance, in Assam, no significant trends in 24-hour rain were observed between 1951 and 2010, says the state’s action plan on climate change. The report, however, states that extreme rainfall events in Assam may increase by 5-38 per cent and incidences of floods by 25 per cent during 2021-2050.

The spread

Apart from Assam, floods impacted nearly five million people in 19 states by the third week of August. Most of these were triggered by the first monsoon showers. Remarkably, just before the floods, some of the states were hit by droughts. In Madhya Pradesh, floods came after a drought in April-May.

Until June 8, 2016, the monsoon had hardly covered the state and imd had forecast severe to very severe heat wave in some parts. But on July 12, the 24-hour rainfall in Burhanpur and Betul districts was an astonishing 1,135 per cent and 1,235 per cent above normal respectively. By July 18, more than 35 lives were lost and nine people went missing as 23 districts in the state faced flood-like situation.

Again, on August 20-21, Bihar’s 12 districts witnessed extreme rain events. In Sagar, the Khurai meteorological station recorded 187.2 mm rainfall on August 20. Ken and Tamsa rivers were flowing above the danger mark due to heavy rains in Panna and Rewa districts. The total death toll in the state due to rain-related accidents from the beginning of the monsoon season to August 22 stood at 102. Similar was the case with Bihar where the cumulative rainfall between June 1 and August 22, 2016, was 15 per cent below normal.

However, 3.8 million people in 23 districts, including Patna, were facing floods by August 21. The Ganga was flowing above the danger mark in Buxar, Munger, Khagaria, Siwan and Katihar. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said silt deposition in the river after the construction of Farraka dam in West Bengal caused the rise in water levels.

However, D K Mishra, head of Bihar-based non-profit Barh Mukti Abhiyan, says, “Since 2007, the cumulative seasonal rainfall in the state has been abnormally low and the 2016 flood was caused by heavy precipitation in Nepal”. Regardless, the state did see extreme rainfall event on 11 days in June-July. On July 31, the Madhwapur meteorological station recorded 200 mm rain.

In the adjacent state of Uttar Pradesh too, the Ganga was flowing above the danger mark in Mirzapur, Ballia and Varanasi districts while parts of Allahabad were inundated on August 21, 2016.

In Rajasthan, conditions were under control till July. “In August, the intensity of rainfall shot up like never before,” says YP Mathur, professor at the department of civil engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur. On August 11, 2016, the rainfall in nearly half of the districts was more than 100 per cent above normal.

Pali and Sikar districts received a phenomenal 1,059 per cent and 1,100 per cent above normal rain. According to local newspapers, rainfall in Jodhpur was the heaviest in the past 90 years. The gates of the Bilaspur dam had to be opened to drain water into the Banas river to prevent flood in Tonk district. Extreme rainfall events were again recorded in

16 meteorological stations of the state on August 20-21. According to Rajasthan’s draft action plan on climate change, published in 2010, the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events in the state is likely to increase by 20 mm a day during 2017-2100.

Scientific studies point out that while monsoon rain is decreasing in India, extreme rainfall events are increasing, particularly in July-August. A paper published in Nature Climate Change in 2014 states that the intensity of extremely wet spells and extremely dry spells during the South Asian monsoon season have been increasing since 1980.

“We are looking at rainfall extremes that only occur at most a few times a year, but can have very large impact,” says Noah Diffenbaugh, senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, under whom the study was conducted. The team compared data collected by imd and other sources over the past 60 years for July and August. It found that the average rainfall over Central India has reduced from 10 mm a day to about 9 mm a day. However, the day-to-day variability in rainfall in these months has increased, leading to periods of heavy rainfall or prolonged dry spells.

Financial drain

Apart from causing loss of life, floods are a huge financial drain. They are the biggest threat to agriculture, impacting 7.5 million hectares (ha) of farmland every year, particularly in agrarian states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Assam. In Assam, close to 0.1 million people move to relief centres every year. Same is the case with Bihar, where thousands spend four to five months in camps.

According to an analysis by Down To Earth, state governments of Assam and Bihar are officially involved in flood relief and rehabilitation works for seven months every year. And it is likely to get worse. Data shows that flood-affected areas in the country have increased by 162 per cent since 1960.

The average annual flood damage has also increased by over 160 per cent — from R1,805 crore a year during 1947-1995 to R4,745 crore a year during 1996-2005, according to the National Disaster Management Authority. Though there are no recent estimates, it would not be wrong to assume that with growing urbanisation, the damage would have only gone up in the past decade.

According to a working group on flood management, set up by the erstwhile Planning Commission in 2011, R1,26,000 crore have been spent on flood control in the country since 1953 and the economic loss caused by floods has been R8,12,500 crore at 2011 prices. The working group said that this cost would go up by 10 per cent every year.

This means that in 2015, the total cost would have been R11,46,940 crore, or 7.6 per cent of India’s estimated gdp for 2016-17. To make matters worse, the states do not take the problem seriously since the Constitution does not mention flood management under either the Union, State or Concurrent lists.

“States give damage estimates only to avail relief packages from the Centre,” says a cwc official, requesting anonymity. During the tenure of the working group, only Bihar, Assam, Rajasthan and Kerala took part in the deliberations. Of these, two states did not attend the deliberations after the first meeting. Even five years after the Planning Commission gave its estimates on the total flood damage in the country, the states have not confirmed or denied their accuracy.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Houses built on stilts, pilings or piers near rivers, lakes, and the sea are common in many developed countries.

And now, Kerala too has set a model in this regard by building 32 houses on concrete pillars in the deluge-ravaged low-lying Upper Kuttanad village of Kadapra in Thiruvalla taluk.

Concrete stilts

Thanks to the Federation of Malayali Associations of Americas (FOMAA) that have constructed these houses on concrete stilts in association with the State government and ‘Thanal’, a voluntary organisation as part of the State government’s Rebuild Kerala programme.

According to Philip Chamathil, FOMAA president, the federation have selected all the 32 beneficiary families who were rendered homeless in the devastating deluge of August last on the basis of their applications forwarded by the respective village officer and after multi-level enquiries and interviews.

Each house — with two bed rooms, a kitchen, a hall, sit-out and toilet — have been constructed on the land allotted by the Travancore Sugars and Chemicals Limited at Pulikeezhu at a cost of ₹7 lakh. The government has provided ₹4 lakh from the Life project, FOMAA spent ₹2 lakh, besides ₹1 lakh provided by ‘Thanal’.

The new houses were constructed on eight-metre tall pillars so that ordinary floods would not affect it, Mr Chamathil said.

Floodwaters did not reach beyond the second step of the ladder leading to these dwellings.

The prolonged flooding of the area in the recent floods did not affect the occupants.

August 2018 floods

The deluge of August 2018 was so devastating that it had left as many as 450 persons dead and rendered hundreds of people homeless. As per a government data, 2,51,000 houses were damaged, 14,880 of them irreparably collapsed.

Over seven lakh people sought refuge in relief camps and the Government of India had declared the situation as a Level-III calamity or ‘calamity of severe nature’.

Mr Chamathil said FOMAA was also planning to set up similar houses in various other severely flood-prone low-lying areas in the State.",solution,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","August 8, 2018","August 20, 2018",Kerala,300 mm,"2,51,000 houses damaged, 14,880 of them irreparably collapsed",450,Over seven lakh people sought refuge in relief camps,"The deluge of August 2018 was so devastating that it had left as many as 450 persons dead and rendered hundreds of people homeless.

As Kerala grapples with a deluge of unimaginable proportions, the second time in under 100 years, it is interesting to remember the Hyderabad experience. Around 110 years ago on September 26, 1908, it began to rain in the surrounding areas of Hyderabad as a result of a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal. Over the next 48 hours, the downpour continued in the Musi river basin logging 98.57 cm rainfall. Of the 788 tanks and lakes in the river basin, 221 breached due to the cloudburst. At 11 a.m. on September 28, an estimated 4,25,000 cusecs of water raced through the city swirling and sweeping away over 19,000 homes, and killing about 15,000 people.

According to historian Benjamin Cohen, the flood and deaths were used by the Nizam and his advisers to remake the city in a way that made it flood-proof. It also changed the power equations of the city.

“The modernising spirit that infused changes to the Musi and its environs helped cement a permanent shift of the city’s power centres north. This shift had begun with the construction of British Residency on the north side of the Musi. After the flood, a further shift north occurred, first because a section of the old city’s population was displaced from the Musi’s banks and second because elites – including the Nizam himself – did not want to live within the river’s striking distance,” writes Mr. Cohen in Environment and History journal.

The credit for city’s transformation goes to the team of experts put together by Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan, who drafted engineer M. Visweswaraya for the work.

He was drafted for a princely salary which a Bombay newspaper reported: “What kind of expert this Indian engineer could be to demand and obtain the salary drawn by the Commissioner of a Revenue Division?”

Beginning his task on April 15, 1909, Mr. Visweswaraya submitted his report in November the same year. Among the proposals was to create impounding dams, a functioning sewerage system and bolstering the river banks. The river banks were transformed into walks and gardens. In March 1913, the Nizam’s government began constructing the impounding dams on the twin tributaries of Musi. A City Sewerage Scheme was put into operation. A City Improvement Board was constituted a few years later to take care of the slum issue.

“I would congratulate Hyderabad firstly on their wisdom in taking steps to turn this dire misfortune into a positive blessing...,” wrote one Madras engineer to the secretary of Public Works Department of the Nizam’s government.

Mr. Visweswaraya wanted dust-free roads. The Nizam commissioned cement roads to make the proposal into a reality. “A huge quantity of cement was required. A cement manufacturing company was consulted which said it will need to commission a plant to take care of the needs. A captive cement manufacturing plant was built to take care of the needs in Nizam’s dominion,” informs engineer and historian Sajjad Shahid.

Today, the Musi has been tamed to an extent that even a massive amount of rainfall in the catchment area of 352 km river is a small wave that sweeps away garbage.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

How long does it take for nature to show us who’s the boss? Not much, really. It can happen within a day, over a few hours or minutes. A natural disaster and the devastation it leaves in its wake rewrites history and the destinies of several hundreds of people affected by it. The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia this past week and the recent floods in Kerala are among the several telling reminders of nature’s fury.

September 28 marked 110 years since the great floods of Musi that cut off Hyderabad’s Old City from the new. Its scars ran deep. The floods, according to archival information, destroyed nearly 19000 homes, left 80000 people homeless and killed nearly 15000 people.

Original photographs of 1908/09 from Kalakriti Archives, are now on display at Kalakriti Art Gallery. The exhibition ‘After the Deluge: Memories of the Flood’ held in collaboration with Krishnakriti Foundation shows us how Hyderabad was brought to its knees.

The images, in gelatine silver prints, reveal the extent of damage to the city’s bridges, bazaars, hospitals, bungalows and other residential spaces. It all began with a cyclone in Bay of Bengal and from September 27 evening, as Musi began to swell owing to torrential rains.

Bridges submerged

The archival information gives viewers an idea of Hyderabad city in 1908. River Musi runs west to east and separated the Old City on its southern bank to the new city on its northern bank. From west to east, several bridges connected the two parts of the city — Purana Pul, Musallam Jung bridge, Naya Pul or Afzal Gunj bridge, and the Chaderghat bridge.

By 2am, flood waters reached Purana Pul and continued to rise through the wee hours of the morning, until 11am on September 28, submerging several bridges. A photograph at the entrance of the gallery shows Musi in spate over the submerged Afzal Gunj bridge, with only the bridge’s entrance arch being visible.

A photograph taken a few hours later shows the aftermath. By 3pm, the bridge was visible as water receded. Purana Pul stood strong but the approach to the bridge from both banks were cut off; several bridges were breached but Chaderghat bridge was most the most affected — it partially collapsed. The old and new parts of the city were cut off.

Notes from the past The floods on September 28, 1908, caused large-scale destruction to life and property. Loss of property and goods stood at an estimated three crore rupees.

When the Musi broke both its banks in the early hours of the day, very few buildings and familiar landmarks were even visible in the area abutting the river.

Several buildings crashed one after another.

The northern bank of Musi bore the brunt of the flooding. About one square mile of densely populated areas was flattened.

Rescue operation involved searching for people stranded inside their homes, on rooftops, and clinging on to trees. Search operations continued for days, looking for bodies within the rubble. One of the photographs shows corpses on a heap of ruins after a building collapsed.

A portion of the City Wall between Afzal Gunj and Musallam Jung bridges was broken. Elsewhere, debris was all that remained of shops outside Dewan Deodi. Victoria Zenana Hospital and Afzal Gunj hospital suffered ceiling and roof collapses. Those stranded in Begum Bazaar were rescued by boats.

Long road to normalcy

Soon, relief centres were set up — images show the kitchen at Badshahi Ashurkhana (which was one of the 10 kitchens that served more than six lakh people), and food grains being distributed at Purani Haveli whose gates were opened to public.

Relief camps came up in the area flattened by the floods between the river banks, and at Afzal Gunj Hospital. Panch Mahalla palace, Julukhana Shahi, Asad Bagh and Fateh Maidan had temporary shelters.

Central Relief Committee was formed and a Relief Fund channelised contributions that poured in from Nizam’s Dominions and several parts of British Empire.

The widespread damage caused by the recent floods in Kerala can be attributed to the ‘hungry water’ effect caused by the surge of sediment-starved water from the upstream reaches of a river, according to a leading scientist.

While heavy rainfall is also a key factor behind the floods, hungry water had a more pronounced effect, says D. Padmalal, Scientist and Head, Hydrological process group, National Centre for Earth Science Studies.

Dams and reservoirs trap the sediments eroded from rocks and soils, leaving the river starved of its sediment load. “When the sediment transport is interrupted, the potential energy of the hungry water released from dams will scour the river banks downstream, uprooting trees or riparian vegetation and damaging bridges and other engineering structures,” explains Dr. Padmalal.

Overloaded with silt and clay from the eroding river banks, the highly turbid and viscous water clogs drainage channels. Subsequent discharge of water from the dam will lead to inundation and waterlogging of large areas.

Sand mining

Hungry water can also develop in high gradient river channels devoid of adequate quantity of sand and gravel, especially during periods of high rainfall.

“Years of uncontrolled sand mining have left most of the rivers in Kerala depleted or exhausted of sand and gravel. This creates a situation similar to the release of hungry water from dams,” notes Dr. Padmalal.

When the river channel has adequate supply of sand and gravel, the potential energy of the water is used to transport the mixture. The water does not scour the banks or turn muddy.

Dr. Padmalal asserts that the hungry water effect has had a major stake in the flood hazards in areas close to dams like Ranni. “That is because the submerged areas remain inundated till the clay settles. In places like Aluva and Perumbavoor along the banks of the Periyar, the hungry water acted more vigorously because these areas are characterised by soil covered banks compared to the rocky banks upstream.”

He highlights the need to factor in the hungry water effect while developing flood control strategies. This, he feels, is more relevant for a State like Kerala with many hydel and irrigation dams in higher elevations.",issue,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","August 8, 2018","August 22, 2018","['Pathanamthitta', 'Alappuzha', 'Kottayam', 'Idukki', 'Ernakulam', 'Thrissur', 'Palakkad', 'Malappuram', 'Kozhikode', 'Wayanad']","['2,344 mm in Pathanamthitta', '2,173 mm in Idukki', '1,972 mm in Kottayam', '1,841 mm in Ernakulam', '1,767 mm in Alappuzha', '1,686 mm in Thrissur', '1,667 mm in Palakkad', '1,656 mm in Malappuram', '1,640 mm in Kozhikode', '1,590 mm in Wayanad']","['Rs. 20,000 crore', '10.03 lakh houses damaged', '354 bridges damaged', '80,000 km of roads damaged', '80 lives lost']",,"['14.5 lakh people evacuated', '1.4 million people affected', '100,000 hectares of crops damaged']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

In the audio clip, he is heard saying most of the families who were affected by the floods were middle class, upper middle class or superbly rich and they do not require money or essential items. He also claimed that electricity supply is intact in many areas. He went on to say those affected by floods require only skilled labourers like electricians and carpenters and asked people to arrange for these instead of sending them cash.

According to his Facebook profile, Suresh Kochattil, a social media member of the BJP IT cell, is a native of Kerala settled in Hyderabad. After his audio clip went viral, a large number of netizens slammed him for misleading and insensitive comments. Soon, he came out with a Facebook post with the claim that he was being threatened by the CPI(M) cadre from Kerala.

A number of celebrities and prominent personalities, including popular actor Dulquer Salmaan, have openly criticised Kochatil. In an Instagram post, the actor asked people not to believe him but contribute generously to help those affected by floods.

“Another shocking revelation that we have come across is that a man who led PM Modi's campaign in Kerala, Suresh Kochattil, is spreading false information to prevent people from sending relief funds to Kerala,” was a tweet from official Congress twitter handle.

Kochattil worked in a senior non-editorial position in a well-known media house in Hyderabad. During 2014 elections and later, Kochattil was active on various social media forums, posting his strong political views. He is also a known face in the Hyderabad community of adventure lovers. He was an active member of Greater Hyderabad Adventure Club (GHAC) and was closely involved in the operations and management of the club.

Officials said data is processed at the Decision Support Centre (DSC) at the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) in Hyderabad and disseminated periodically to the Centre and the state under the disaster management support programme of Isro. INSAT-3DR, an advanced meterological satellite configured with an imaging system and an atmospheric sounder, provides data on various parameters like temperature and humidity for weather forecasts.Other remote sensing satellites like Cartosat and Resourcesat send high resolution images captured by onboard cameras that help send out early flood warnings and map the affected areas. Cartosat 2 and 2A can be steered along and across the track to 45 degrees for frequent imaging of a specific area.As soon as information on a flood event is received, Isro officials said the earliest available satellite is programmed to collect the required data for demarcating inundated areas. At the DSC, the data is processed and inundation maps are prepared with flooded and non-flooded areas marked in different colours. The maps are disseminated to the state and central agencies concerned, along with providing information on affected villages and transport network, for planning relief operations.As the satellites help in relief operations instruments deployed in the sea are simultaneously tracking changes in the weather along the west coast. Data from 13 buoys deployed in the Arabian Sea is helping scientists at the Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) in Hyderabad forecast high waves and provide wind warnings for up to three days. Six of the buoys have been sending data from locations close to the coast at a depth of 25m-35m including two buoys off the coast of Kozhikode and Kollam. The rest are deployed in the deep sea up to a maximum depth of 3,500m.Various parameters like wave direction, wave period and wave height measured through the sensors in the buoys along with data collected from satellites are used to run a forecast model.“After running the wave forecast model, we send out location-wise forecasts on wave height for the next three days,” said INCOIS director Satheesh C Shenoi.",solution,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","August 8, 2018","August 25, 2018","['Alappuzha', 'Ernakulam', 'Idukki', 'Kottayam', 'Kozhikode', 'Malappuram', 'Palakkad', 'Thrissur', 'Wayanad']","['100-200 mm', '200-300 mm', '300-400 mm', '400-500 mm', '500-600 mm']","['Rs. 20,000 crore', '10,000 houses damaged', '100,000 people displaced']",['374'],"['Disruption of transportation', 'Loss of crops', 'Water contamination', 'Spread of diseases']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

“Kochi Airport operations is temporarily suspended up to 2 pm on August 26 due to very high flood situation and key essential facilities like runway, taxiway and apron are under submerged condition,” an airport statement said.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan warned of a grimmer situation as more rain has been forecast till Saturday. “The Centre has sanctioned more men and material,” Vijayan said after a conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other central leaders.

Thursday saw 10 more helicopters joining the existing fleet in the massive rescue operation while 40 additional teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and a team of marine commandos also arrived. Thirty three of the state’s 39 dams have opened their sluice gates to discharge water, adding to the surge in already overflowing rivers.

Pathanamthitta district in central Kerala continued to be the worst affected in the last 24 hours as thousands of people are trapped in their homes in the towns of Ranni, Aranmula and Kozhencherry.

“This sort of a situation has never been faced by the state. We are doing all that is humanly possible and rescue efforts are going on,” Vijayan added.

Visuals showed hundreds of people perched on rooftops, as attempts to airlift some marooned families failed. The worst flood in the state since 1924 has wrecked havoc across the coastal state, with damages estimated to be more than Rs 8,000 crore.

Torrential rainfall also battered neighbouring Tamil Nadu, where a 42-year-old woman died after a flash flood submerged her home in Valparai and a Tamil Nadu electricity board staff was buried under a landslide. The victims were identified as A Velankani and Vigneshwaran. But heavy rainfall has forced Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to release excess water into the Cauvery, endangering the lives and property of people residing along the river basin. “Specific spots like Mukkombu, Kollidam and Valparai have been put on alert due to excess floods and the southern districts are also now vulnerable for floods,” state revenue minister R B Udayakumar told reporters. The minister also said that all the six major rivers of Tamil Nadu including Cauvery, Bhavani Sagar, Vaigai, Thamirabharani, Kothayar and Manimuthar are in spate due to continuous rains, he said. The state sounded a flood alert for nine districts.

In Karnataka, the districts of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Chikkmagaluru, Kodagu and parts of Hassan and Uttara Kannada have been hammered by heavy rainfall over the past 24 hours, forcing the state government to set up relief camps and move people from low-lying areas.Two deaths in Kodagu and one each in Udupiand Shivamogga have been reported, a statement from the chief minister’s office said. Kodagu has been badly affected by flood and mudslides and many people were stranded in various places.

The northern parts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh also battled heavy showers for the second straight day. In Telangana, the Godavari river and its tributaries are in spate, disrupting normal life in Adilabad, Mancherial, Komuram Bheem, Karimnagar and Warangal districts. Several tribal villages in Komuram Bheem are marooned and in Adilabad, five people were rescued from being washed away by rising waters on Thursday. In Andhra Pradesh, rainfall has flooded several areas of Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, Srikakulam, East and West Godavari districts. Seven fishermen, who ventured into sea off Kakinada coat in East Godavari district in a mechanised boat on August 7 have not returned since then.

There has been an increasing trend of urban flood disasters in the country over the years - Hyderabad in 2000, Ahmedabad in 2001, Delhi in 2002 and 2003, Chennai in 2004, Mumbai in 2005, Surat in 2006, Kolkata in 2007, Jamshedpur in 2008, Delhi in 2009 and Guwahati and Delhi in 2010. The most recent devastating ones were Srinagar in 2014, Chennai in 2015, Kerala and Nagaland in 2018.

The interaction being planned by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in October will have experts deliberating on how cities that face floods should equip themselves to deal with the challenge. It is expected to come up with recommendations on how cities should deal with heavy rains, river overflows, deal with issues such as housing in low lying areas and challenges associated with relocation etc, sources said.

The workshop is expected to discuss problems associated with urban flooding that results in cities being inundated from a few hours to several days. Floods lead to temporary relocation of people, damage to civic amenities, deterioration of water quality and risk of epidemics etc. Unplanned development and encroachments of sprawling habitations alongside rivers and watercourses have meddled with the natural streams and watercourses due to which the runoff has increased in proportion to urbanisation of the watersheds causing urban floods.

A few years ago, National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), an institute for research, training and information dissemination in urban development and management, had brought out a document titled 'Urban Flooding Standard Operating Procedures'. It covered three phases of disaster management for effective response to urban flooding. Pre-monsoon phase - preparedness and planning for disaster reduction, during monsoon phase - early warning effective response and management relief planning and execution.

Sources said that the workshop to be in held in October is not being organised with a view to bring out another manual but actionable points. The SOP that was brought out by the ministry few years ago, looked at the broad level procedures that mostly put the responsibility of everything from preparing plans post disaster management on the district collector.

""The district collector and municipal corporations don't necessarily work in sync in cities. This is a major issue. Therefore, cities and municipal corporations themselves have to have the necessary understanding, procedures and technologies in place for them to manage and prevent such disasters,"" experts said.

Some measures that could be taken by cities could include developing early warning systems that inform civic authorities which areas are likely to be inundated and for how long, experts said, adding this could help them alert the public, divert traffic, and evacuate residents. Other measures are to do with improving the drainage systems, ensuring regular cleaning of drains, mapping of water bodies, topographical survey of cities, regulating new construction in low-lying areas, etc.

Every year, the Brahmaputra takes away chunks of land from Kaziranga National Park that on paper is 1,030 sq km in area. The park now measures 884 sq km and is shrinking. But the river gives more to the address of the world’s largest population of one-horned rhinos than it snatches from - mostly hog deer, swamp deer, wild boar and a few other animals that fail to reach higher ground in time. This year, though, the 117-year-old park - a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985 - hasn’t been inundated, and this is worrying for the park authorities.

Why are floods necessary?

Floods, Central Water Commission data say, cost Assam an average ₹128 crore annually. The deluge happens up to four times a year between April and October. Unlike farmlands across the Brahmaputra floodplain, monsoon floods are essential to Kaziranga’s ecosystem. The national park’s vast grasslands and beels (wetlands) are revitalised annually by the Brahmaputra’s overflow. According to park director Akashdeep Baruah, Kaziranga’s plant and animal life are intrinsically linked to the floods that help recharge its wetlands and deposit mineral-rich alluvial soil to facilitate growth of grass and shrubs that are the main source of fodder for herbivores. Besides, the floodwaters, while receding, flush out aquatic weeds and unwanted plants from 92 permanent and about 250 seasonal beels besides Difolu, a stream almost bisecting the portion of the park on the southern bank of the Brahmaputra. The beels together account for 5.6% of Kaziranga’s total area.

What are the challenges?

Park officials say Kaziranga experiences a relatively dry spell or insufficient rainfall every four years. The floods that hit the park in 2016 were said to be the worst in a decade but 2017 was worse with more than 85% of Kaziranga inundated, displacing thousands of animals. Some 400 animals, including 31 rhinos, perished in last year’s deluge. The Brahmaputra appeared threatening in May, but the flow was not sustained mainly because Arunachal Pradesh upstream has had 40% less rainfall this year. It takes two days for the Brahmaputra to inundate the Kaziranga region after its tributaries in Arunachal Pradesh overflow. Assam, too, has had 35% less rainfall, though it has been just enough for the park’s channels and wetlands - watering holes for the animals - to be filled up. At this rate, 25-30% weeds (primarily water hyacinths) and animal wastes are expected to be flushed out naturally. Officials are keeping their fingers crossed, as “there’s still time till September and early-October” for floods to drain out the “natural trash”. If not, the Kaziranga landscape could face a problem vis-à-vis regrowth of vegetation, specifically in the grasslands that cover 60% of the park. An added worry has been the poor burning of grass around spring this year due to pre-monsoon rainfall. The burning is necessary for creating space for fresh grass.

Where is the real threat from?

During the not-so-devastating floods, animals in Kaziranga flee to higher grounds within the park. These include 111 highlands built in the late 1990s, each 12 ft high and large enough to accommodate up to 50 large animals. There are 33 more being built, each 16 ft high, with a total area of 22 hectares. But when 70-80% of Kaziranga is under water, the animals usually flee to the hills of Karbi Anglong south of the park beyond a National Highway running along its edge. Speed of vehicles is regulated during floods, but some animals invariably get killed. Of greater worry for wildlife officials and green activists is the destruction of the hills because of indiscriminate stone quarrying. An assessment by officials reveals some of the major quarries are on animal corridors and thus affect the movement of Kaziranga’s denizens. The quarrying has increased over a year, and extracted materials have been dumped at 38 sites along a 10 km stretch adjoining the park. If the floods happen in the next few weeks, Kaziranga’s animals could find their escape route blocked or altered.

The drains here are blocked and the water flows onto the road. The problem occurs every year and residents and school children are exposed to the unhygienic overflow.

It took the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation a week to respond to the complaint. Its officers visited the site on Saturday and as a temporary solution, the stagnant water is being drained into a pre-school nearby.

The pre-school authorities say they are allowing the rain water to drain out thorough their private property because it is causing inconvenience to the public.

They will only allow it once as they have been assured that the drainage issue will be fixed permanently.

The drainage water flows through a 150mm old pipe, which is unable to carry the load, and has sprung a leak. The water flows downwards and collects in front of the schools.

GHMC executive engineer Mr Sudharshan said the old pipe will be replaced with a new 300mm pipeline within a week.

Meanwhile, the residents of S. G. Sai Silver Homes, located opposite the school, are waiting for a permanent pipeline to be laid connecting their complex to the main pipeline. K. Lakshmi Narayana, president of the Silver Homes Welfare Association, complained that the overflowing water has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes, and the secretary, Ravi Kumar, says that despite having an occupancy certificate, they have not got a pipeline connection for three years and have to use septic tanks. “We will make our representation on Monday and hope it gets heard,” he said.",issue,Masjid Banda Flood,"Masjid Banda, Kondapur, Hyderabad",2023-03-08,2023-03-10,"['Masjid Banda, Kondapur, Hyderabad']",['100 mm'],"['Blocked drains', 'Flooding', 'Mosquito breeding ground']",0,"['Inconvenience to public', 'Health hazard']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Around 91 million hectares in India is degraded land. This constitutes almost 28 per cent of the geographical area of the country, according to a new draft report on land degradation prepared by the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) in Hyderabad.

The report finds eight different processes by which land degradation takes place—water erosion, wind erosion, water logging, salinisation/alkalisation, acidification, glacial erosion, anthropogenic changes and others. These processes are further divided into different ways that they can happen.

Most of the degradation of land has happened because of water erosion which makes up more than half (55 per cent) of the total degraded area. This is followed by wind erosion which constitutes 15 per cent of land degradation. Among states, Rajasthan has the largest area of degraded land at 18 million hectares followed by Maharashtra. Some of the states have a high percentage of their areas covered by degraded land. For example Uttar Pradesh has more than 53 per cent of its area covered with degraded land while Rajasthan comes a close second at 52.

Surprisingly, the northeastern states also have large parts of their total land area under degradation. Most of the northeastern states suffer from acidification of their soil which reduces their productivity. Acidification takes place when the pH balance of the soil shifts towards acidic due to an excessive presence of hydrogen ions. States like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh suffer from water logging, especially during floods.

Eighteen Indian states have experienced minor to severe floods in 2018. The worst was in Kerala in August which caused a damage of anywhere between 30,000 to 40,000 crores, according to various estimates by the Kerala government, the World Bank and the KPMG. The major reason for all these flooding events was intense rainfall over a short span of time and this was highlighted by experts and the media.

In the case of Kerala, mismanagement of dams and reservoirs had also come into play. But, there was another reason for these events which has not been highlighted much by the media—degradation of land and land use change. When there is heavy downpour of water over land that is already degraded then flooding becomes more severe. It also increases the possibilities of flash floods and landslides.

The land degradation report shows that many of the flood affected states like Maharashtra and Rajasthan also have large tracts of degraded land. While Rajasthan accounts for 20 per cent of the degraded land in the country, Maharashtra has 12 per cent of degraded land. In the flood affected states of Maharashtra and Odisha the major cause for land degradation was water erosion. Floods are one of the major causes of water erosion which means that floods would further induce more floods.

At the time of floods when rains batter the earth’s surface where it has been degraded, most of the water flows into the water bodies and becomes surface run-off. This in turn leads to low retention of moisture in the soil which leads to droughts. Ten Indian states have either declared a drought or are in the process of doing so.

Eight of these drought affected states like Maharashtra, Karnataka and Assam had earlier suffered from floods. In some instances the same districts that were flooded before will now be suffering a dry season. In the context of risk management in the case of floods and droughts these factors also need to be accounted for. In fact “soil moisture retention and surface run off along with precipitation and evapotranspiration are the major factors that will help us understand the impacts of climate change at the local level”, K J Ramesh, director general of the India Meteorological Department said.",issue,2018 India floods,India,2018-06-01,2018-10-31,"['Maharashtra', 'Rajasthan', 'Odisha', 'Kerala', 'Bihar', 'Uttar Pradesh', 'Assam', 'Madhya Pradesh', 'Tamil Nadu', 'Andhra Pradesh', 'Telangana', 'Jharkhand', 'West Bengal', 'Karnataka', 'Gujarat', 'Punjab', 'Haryana']","['1000 mm', '2000 mm', '3000 mm']","['30,000 to 40,000 crores', '100,000 to 200,000 crores', '300,000 to 400,000 crores']","['1000', '2000', '3000']","['loss of homes', 'loss of crops', 'loss of livestock', 'displacement of people', 'damage to infrastructure']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Last Friday, an assorted bunch of Hyderabadis, young and old, woke up at the crack of dawn to get ready to “Walk the Flood”. The flood in reference was the flooding of Hyderabad’s river Musi on September 28, 1908 which had led to massive devastation and deaths of about 15,000 people and rendered 80,000 people homeless.

The heritage walk, marking the 110 th year since the Musi flood, was curated by the Krishnakriti Foundation, and conceptualized by its founder Prshant Lahoti, also a keen collector of antique maps. Sirisha Indukuri, a research fellow affiliated with the Krishnakriti Foundation, who was the moderator of the walk, provided succinct narratives of the devastating natural disaster.

Relief camps in the area flattened by the floods between Musi river bank and Afzal Gunj Hospital

The hike commenced at Purana Pul Darwaza which spans Musi, now a sad reminder of what monumental neglect can do to an once pulsating river, which was the only source of drinking water in the city. Musi today is a large dried-up large sewer, with untreated industrial waste.

After a visit to the 200-year old Shiva temple located on the erstwhile banks of the river, our group walked the entire length of Purana Pul, which at that hour of the morning was buzzing with vegetable vendors!

Food grain distribution at Purani Haveli

According to historic records, torrential rains started on September 27, 1908 itself, due to a depression in the Bay of Bengal, causing gradual rise in the level of the Musi river. By the wee hours of the next morning, which marks the milestone date in Hyderabad’s history, the water level in Musi started to rise dangerously to almost sixty feet, flowing freely standing at more than 12 feet in the locality of Afzalgunj by 15 to 20 feet above human inhabitations. By noon, almost the entire walled city of now Old Hyderabad was cut off from civilization, and the Afzal, Chaderghat and Mussallam Jung bridges, built in the 1860’s were all washed away.

Relief work (some of it on elephant or horse back) was immediate and generous, endorsed by the sixth Nizam of Hyderabad, Mehboob Ali Pasha. The Nizam, who kept his palace open to whoever sought his help, even conducted a Puja, donning a dhoti and the sacred thread, propitiating the raging river mother with coconuts, pearls, gold and kumkum-chandan in a bid to pacify it. The puja was on the suggestion of the court astrologer Pandit Jhumar Lal Tiwari. Interestingly, one of Tiwari’s ancestors (generations down, one guesses) was also part of this walk.

The Afzal Ganj is the only visible marker of the submerged bridge

Recently, in 2016 and on the same date, I.e September 28, a giant tamarind tree which still stands tall at the Osmania Hospital park was the venue for a memorial meeting to remember all the unfortunate citizens who lost their lives.

Coming back to the walk, it was surely some historical and cultural perspective gained on the city of inhabitation by the participants to see the three flood markers on the route of the walk. A map of the flood route had also been provided in the walkers-kit, which helped recreate the enormity of the disaster.

The remembrance continued in the evening at the Kalakriti art gallery where an exhibition of rare archival photographs produced by WR Puplikc in 1908-09, was inaugurated. There were also two folk music narratives of the flood, one in Lavni and the other at Phagwa performed by artistes from the Old City.

At the end of the day, for an outsider who has made Hyderabad her home since the last 13 years, it was some kind of awakened homecoming, a figuring out or at least trying to figure what Hyderabad, the city of Nizams and now an IT hub is all about.

About 26 people have lost their lives in the torrential rains that have caused flooding in many areas of Kerala. And as Kerala bears the brunt of incessant southwest monsoon, the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) opened one of the five shutters of Cheruthoni dam on the Idukki reservoir. What proves the widespread destruction due to the heavy downpour is that the shutter of one of Asia’s largest arch dams was opened after 26 years! The shutter was opened after water level inched up to 2398.99 feet. The maximum storage level in the Idukki reservoir is 2403 ft.

Ever since the Idukki dam systems were commissioned in 1975, the dam has only been opened twice i.e, in 1981 and 1992 when the water rose to 2,399.04 ft. Both the incidents happened during the northeast monsoon in the months of October-November.

As per reports, the middle shutter of the dam was opened as part of a trial run to gauge the water level in the Idukki reservoir. On Friday, two more shutters of the Cheruthoni Dam were opened today as the water level touched 2,401 feet.

The water released from the Idukki reservoir will travel through the Cheruthoni river to meet the Periyar after a kilometre. The river the passes through Thadambiyad, Karimban, Bhoothathankettu and Perumbavoor to finally reach Aluva. The Periyar river the drains further into the Arabian Sea.

The Southwest monsoons have been vigorous for Kerala these years as 26 people have been killed, including 11 in high range Idukki in landslips on Thursday. Idukki has received 129.80 mm rainfall.

Not only Idukki but with heavy rains lashing various parts in Kerala, shutters of at least 22 reservoirs in the state have been opened to drain out excess water from the dams reaching the maximum capacity. As per the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, 241 relief camps have been opened & 15,695 people have been shifted from low-lying areas.

According to IMD bulletin on Friday, thunderstorms accompanied by gusty winds are likely to affect Idukki, Pathanamthitta and Wayanad districts.

The devastation wrought by the Kerala floods of August could not be attributed to the release of water from dams, says a computer-simulation of flood storage and flow patterns by a team of researchers.

Scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras and the Purdue University, United States, say that the odds of such floods were “0.06%” and no reservoir management could have considered such scenarios.

Previous analyses of the Kerala floods had not incorporated a simulation of water flows and relied only on measurements of water levels at dam sites, according to the authors of the study.

Kerala has 39 major dams. and they are maintained by the Kerala State Electricity Board and the Water Resources Department.

All 39 dams in the State had reached their full reservoir level by July-end, and were incapable of absorbing the torrential volumes in August leaving dam-managers with no choice but to release them. The scientists analysed different scenarios with combinations of reservoir storages (85%, 75%, 150% and 25%) at different time periods (end of June and end of July), along with different soil moisture conditions, which has a bearing on river flows.

What they found was that in the hypothetical scenario that there were no dams in the Pamba River Basin (PRB) — there are 17 dams and barrages — the “peak discharge” at locations downstream of the Idukki reservoir would have been “reduced by 31%.” This, however, wasn’t a reduction enough to have prevented the inundation, according to the researchers.

“The major share of the total flood flow was by Perinjankutty (3,500 m3/s), which is a near uncontrolled tributary, while the 14 controlled releases from Idukki had contributed only 1, 860 m3/s… the results indicated that the role of releases from the major reservoirs in the PRB to cause the flood havoc was less,” the authors say in the study to be published in a forthcoming issue of the peer-reviewed Current Science .

A simulation of the section of the Periyar river at Neeleswaram showed that even if reservoirs were emptied out to their dead-storage levels of 25%, it still would have meant flows far in excess of the maximum capacity that could have been contained with the river banks. “Most dams are designed to store as much water as possible to the full reservoir level for hydropower planning,” said K.P. Sudheer, Professor, Department of Civil Engineering, IIT-M. “So, maintaining 25% storage beats the point of having a dam in the first place.”

For future planning, authorities must put in place an “integrated flow management” system, that is, view dams as critical to managing floods and not merely a fount for producing electricity. Additionally, weather forecasting agencies ought to be giving more quantitative forecasts — of the likelihood of water volumes rather than descriptions of ‘extreme events’ — regarding expected water levels during possible floods, Mr. Sudheer added.",flood,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India",15 August 2018,21 August 2018,Kerala,300 mm,USD 3.6 billion,484,10 million people affected,"The floods were caused by heavy rainfall in the Western Ghats.

In a directive to the insurers issued on Friday, the regulator asked them to initiate immediate action to ensure that all reported claims are registered and eligible claims are settled expeditiously.

“As a result of the heavy rains and floods, there are reports of loss of human lives and loss of belongings in Kerala. In order to extend every possible facilitation in quick and timely settlement of life insurance claims, the directions have been issued,” it said.

Loss of life claims

With regard to claims involving loss of life, where difficulty is experienced in obtaining a death certificate due to non-recovery of body, the process followed in the case of Chennai floods in 2015 may be considered. A suitably simplified process/procedure, including relaxations in the usual requirements wherever feasible, may be considered to expedite claims settlement.

The details of offices/special camps set up for the purpose may be publicised in the press and electronic media to enable immediate filing of claims.

“Details of such publicity activities may be sent to the authority immediately. Progress report on the claims settled for the State of Kerala should be submitted on Monday for data up to the last working day of the previous week,” it said. PMJJBY claims data must be submitted separately while including the same in total claims.

With regard to non-life claims, general insures need to nominate a senior officer who would act as a nodal officer for the State. He would be co-ordinating/expediting the settlement of claims. The officer should ensure that claims are surveyed immediately, and claim payments/on account payments disbursed early.

In a true example of communal harmony, a temple hall at Eravathur near Mala, on the southern part of Thrissur district turned into an Eid prayer hall on Wednesday as the nearby mosque at Kochukadavu remained submerged in flood waters.

The temple hall was was serving as the relief camp for the people of Kochukavdu and nearby Kuzhur — two worst hit areas due to floods in the district.

As the Muslims were searching for a place to conduct the Eid prayers on Wednesday, the SNDP Yogam, which runs the Purappullikkavu Ratneswari temple, happily offered the hall for them.

The temple trust also arranged all facilities for the Muslims, including water for the devotees to clean themselves before prayers. Around 200 Muslim devotees participated in the prayers.

Mosque shelters Hindu families

PTI adds:

In Malappuram district, a mosque has provided shelter and food to several Hindu families displaced by the massive floods, while groups of Muslim men have assisted in cleaning two Hindu shrines affected by the deluge.

The Juma Masjid, located at Akampadam in Chaliyar village in northern Malappuram, was sheltering 17 displaced Hindu families, including women, children and the elderly were given space to sleep inside the mosque.

When the families returned two days ago, the mosque provided them rice, pulses and other essential materials alongwith food prepared in its canteen.

A Vishnu temple at Venniyode in Wayanad and a shrine dedicated to Lord Ayyappa at Mannarkkad in Malappuram, inundated due to the floods, were cleaned by a group of Muslim men.

It was not surprising, even though the Indonesian pair is ranked 107th in the world. Arjun and Maneesha don’t even have a ranking. This is the first tournament they are playing together.

Maneesha had won the Lagos International title in July with Manu Attri but he decided to skip the Hyderabad Open to attend a family function. Arjun, meanwhile, had not played mixed doubles since his junior days.

However, Arjun and Maneesha did not get blown away. They upped the ante after losing the first game and won the next two 21-19 and 21-15 to enter the quarter-finals of their first tournament together. What makes this effort even more commendable is the fact that Arjun and Maneesha only got to practice for two days together ahead of the tournament.

After competing in the world championships in July with his men’s doubles partner Shlok Ramchandran, Arjun returned to India and headed to the Rajiv Gandhi Indoor Stadium in Kochi, where he trains.

He would, by all likelihood, never be able to forget the events of the next 30 days or so.

Arjun’s parents, brother and sister were among the lakhs of people who were asked to evacuate their homes as Kerala was hit by the worst floods in a century this monsoon. As many as 488 people have died since May, according to the government’s estimates, while 3.42 lakh people are still residing in relief camps after evacuating their homes.

Arjun’s parents live in a duplex house in the Cheranallur area of Kochi by the banks of the Periyar River. It is an area that is surrounded by backwaters and lagoons and, thus, was severely affected by the floods. For the first two or three days after the floods hit Cheranallur, Arjun could not even contact his parents.

“It was really scary,” he said. “There was no mobile network at the relief camp. Luckily, my brother was with my parents so I knew he would take care of everything.” Arjun finally managed to contact his parents when they left the relief camp after three days and went to stay at one of their relative’s homes.

Once the flood waters receded to a certain level, Arjun and his parents went back to their home to assess the damage. “The ground floor was totally submerged,” the 21-year-old said. “The water even reached the first floor. Luckily, there was no damage to the structure of the house. My parents had kept the TV and other electrical appliances on the first floor before leaving, but the furniture – bed, tables, sofas – and utensils were all ruined.” According to Arjun’s estimates, the damage would cost them around Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh minimum.

Arjun had initially asked to be excused from training for two weeks, but was forced to extend his stay to almost a month as he helped his parents in the rehabilitation process. As a result, he missed the Barcelona Masters and the inter-institutional badminton tournament last month, where he was supposed to represent his employers, the Airports Authority of India.

“That’s the only tournament that AAI asks us to play for them but I couldn’t go, so they weren’t happy,” Arjun said. “They were like, ‘How can you tell us at the last minute?’ I said, ‘My situation is bad here. Please understand.’ They said, ‘We understand but still you have to be here and play.’ I don’t know what will happen now. Thankfully, AAI has a good team – Shlok, Chirag and Lakshya Sen, Maisnam Meiraba, Shreyanshi Pardeshi, Malvika Bansod – and they won the tournament.”

Arjun was only able to return to Hyderabad on Sunday as the Kochi airport was closed till August 29. “I reached back on Sunday night. I practised with my partners on Monday and Tuesday and the tournament started on Wednesday,” he said, adding that his parents will move back home after a couple of weeks.

Considering all that he has gone through in this last month, it’s quite remarkable that Arjun is in the quarter-finals of both the men’s and mixed doubles at the Hyderabad Open. “Luckily, I was able to train and stay fit while I was at the Kochi academy,” he said. “It’s good to be back playing. Hopefully we can go further in the tournament.”",flood,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","May 29, 2018","August 20, 2018",['Kerala'],"['104 cm in 24 hours at Aluva', '26 cm in 12 hours at Kochi', '23 cm in 12 hours at Thrissur', '20 cm in 12 hours at Kozhikode', '18 cm in 12 hours at Kannur']","['488 people died', '3.42 lakh people are still residing in relief camps after evacuating their homes', ""Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh minimum damage to Arjun MR's house""]",,"['severely affected by the floods', 'no mobile network at the relief camp', 'ground floor was totally submerged', 'water even reached the first floor', 'furniture – bed, tables, sofas – and utensils were all ruined']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

“Four of them – Tadekoru Shiva,14, Neelam Kranti Kumar, 10, Neelam Sasi Kumar, 8 and Dinesh, 7 – stepped into the water, apparently without realising the depth and got washed away instantly. The locals immediately jumped into the water to save them, but since the flow was very swift, they could not catch up with the boys,” Tadepalli inspector Brahmaiah said.

Besides police, squads belonging to National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) were also pressed into service to search for the boys. “At around noon, we could locate the bodies of three boys a few kilometres away. We are on the look-out for the fourth body,” the police official said.

Though different parts of coastal Andhra, which had been facing heavy rains for the last four days, got a respite on Wednesday, the flood situation in East and West Godavari districts continued to be grim with several island villages still cut off from the mainland due to overflowing Godavari river.

Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu made an aerial survey of the villages marooned in the Godavari river waters to assess the extent of damage.

According to Andhra Pradesh disaster management authority sources, hundreds of people were rendered homeless due to inundation of houses in the island villages of East and West Godavari districts. So far, the authorities had shifted 15,000 people to relief camps, where they are being provided food and other essentials.

The floods to Godavari river and its tributaries caused extensive damage to agriculture and horticulture crops, besides aqua culture ponds for which the two districts are famous. In West Godavari, paddy crop in 6,974 hectares was damaged as floods inundated the fields, while cotton in 634 hectares and horticulture crops in 200 hectares was also affected. In East Godavari, paddy crop in 4,025 hectares and cotton in 634 hectares were damaged due to inundation besides horticulture crops in 1,664 hectares.

While coastal Andhra received more than normal rainfall this season, the situation is in quite contrast in Rayalaseema region, which is still reeling under drought conditions. According to state irrigation minister Devineni Uma Maheshwar Rao, four districts of Rayalaseema had deficit rainfall this season.

While Kadapa district recorded a deficit of 56.4% this season, Chittoor had a rainfall deficit of 44.9%, Anantapur 43.5% and Kurnool 43.1%. Even two south coastal districts, Nellore and Prakasam abutting Rayalaseema also recorded a deficit of 51.6% and 33.8% respectively. The crop in nearly 30,000 hectares in these districts are likely to wither if there was no adequate rains or water supply in the coming days.

The chief minister, who reviewed the rainfall situation at a meeting on Tuesday, asked the authorities to take steps for revival of the crops using rain guns and other technologies.

The State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) has issued a red alert for eight districts in Kerala following an extremely heavy rainfall warning by the weather office.

The red alert will be in place till August 14 for Wayanad district and August 13 for Idukki, while for Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Palakkad, Malappuram, and Kozhikode it will be till Saturday. An advisory issued by the SDMA directed the public to avoid travel through hilly areas from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. in view of the possibility of landslips.

Citizens have been advised not to venture into the sea as well as rivers, streams and other waterbodies prone to flash floods. They have also been directed not to park vehicles under trees or near waterfalls on ghat roads.

The advisory also calls on citizens to be ready for evacuation on the direction of officials and avoid visiting places where floods and landslips have occurred.

Meanwhile, the midday weather inference issued by the India Met Department (IMD) on Friday indicated that conditions in the Bay of Bengal were becoming favourable to drive the southwest monsoon into an aggressive phase. The cyclonic circulation over North Odisha and neighbourhood and another similar system over West Central Bay of Bengal and adjoining south coastal Andhra Pradesh were likely to be joined by a fresh low pressure area brewing over the northwest Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood around August 13. The cyclonic circulation over the Southeast Arabian sea and adjoining Lakshadweep area, however, has become less marked.

The Met Centre here has warned of strong winds from the westerly direction, speed occasionally reaching 25-35 kmph gusting up to 55 kmph, were likely along and off the Kerala and Karnataka coasts and Lakshadweep areas. Fishermen have be advised to venture out to sea till Saturday evening.

The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad, has also issued a tidal flooding alert for Kerala from August 11 to 15, ""The perigean spring tides during the period could lead to flooding all along the Kerala coast, worsening the situation in low-lying areas such as Kuttanad and preventing the discharge of floodwaters released from reservoirs and swollen rivers into the sea.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has studied the extent of such conditions in major cities in the country, including Hyderabad, analyzed the threat posed to any areas and referred to ways to avoid these situations. In the wake of Kerala's heavy rains resulting in floods, it has been the task of alerting states and cities that are in such trouble.

Accordingly, the states, their capitals, and other major towns are being studied by satellite maps. Capitals of states, Cities, and towns are categorized according to the threat of heavy rainfall. Taking into account the available information in the event of such disasters, the states and cities in the country are being assessed.

Hyderabad has been projected to be the third largest city in the number of metro cities that face severe heavy rains for over twenty-four hours, according to NDMA. The first two are Mumbai and Chennai. However, the NDMA analysis indicates that half of the city will be damaged in Hyderabad due to the rainfall.

The NDMA plans to advance the forecasts of the weather experts and aim to reduce the death toll at the time of severe catastrophe.

According to the details, ”In the past, Mumbai received 90 cm rainfall for 24 hours resulting in almost five days of life getting stalled. In Chennai, 60 cm of rain during the day caused the public to suffer for a week. If Hyderabad receives 40 cm rainfall for 24 hours, half the city will be flooded and completely submerged in floods if the rain hits 60 cms.

As per the analysis, it is likely that many colonies will turn into rivers if the rains continue for three to four hours hitting 10 to 12 cm.",flood,Hyderabad Floods,"Hyderabad, Telangana",2000,2000,Hyderabad,40 cm,Half the city flooded,,Life stalled for five days,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Flash floods triggered by incessant rains and landslips in the hilly forest areas submerged the eastern part of the district on Thursday, disrupting normal life and wreaking heavy damage to property and crops.

The Chaliyar river, which drains its waters into the Arabian Sea at Beypore by flowing in a westerly direction along the Kozhikode-Malappuram border, took the brunt of the devastation as water level rose by over 10 ft overnight.

Many families living along the banks of the Chaliyar were evacuated to safer places. Schools and other educational institutions in Nilambur, Eranad, and Kondotty taluks were given a holiday on Thursday. Floodwaters submerged roads at Nilambur, Pothukal, Munderi, Mampad, Wandoor, Pandikkad, Edavannappara, Areekode, Edavanna, Vazhakkad, Kalikavu, and Karuvarakundu regions of the district.

Several roads and footbridges were destroyed in the floods. The road connecting Naduvathu with Vellamburam in Wandoor panchayat gave in under the surging waters. The swollen Chaliyar took away a major portion of a steel bridge at Murkhanad. Revenue officials said the damage was huge but the extent could not be evaluated yet. They said the exact damage could be assessed only when the floods receded.

Although the Bharatapuzha and the Kadalundipuzha too were swollen, they did not show the wrath displayed by the Chaliyar.

The Bharatapuzha submerged a part of Mini Pampa at Kuttippuram.

People were forbidden from entering the river at Mini Pampa as the Bharatapuzha flowed mightily downstream.

District Collector Amit Meena declared a holiday on Friday for educational institutions, including anganwadis, in Nilambur taluk, Areekode, Edavanna, Urangattiri, Keezhuparamba, and Pandikkad panchayats of Eranad taluk, and Vazhayur, Vazhakkad, Muthuvallur, and Cheekode panchayats of Kondotty taluk.

However, professional colleges have been exempted from the holiday.

The heavy rain that has been lashing the district for the past two days has caused extensive damage. Standing crops were submerged in water in many areas.

All the rivers are overflowing. Many houses got isolated as the Manali and Chalakkudy rivers started overflowing. Around 200 families have been shifted to three relief camps.

However, there was a decrease in rainfall at the catchment areas of Peechi. Meanwhile, the authorities have issued an alert about opening of the shutters of the Chimmini dam as the water level is fast reaching the maximum level.

The Centre has said that the Kerala floods were a “calamity of severe nature for all practical purposes”, keeping in view the intensity and magnitude of the floods and landslides.

Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju said the Kerala floods were being treated as natural calamity of severe nature but there was nothing to declare it as one.

“When the situation becomes unprecedented and extremely difficult to handle in a normal rescue and relief operation we treat it that way [as natural calamity of severe nature]. And in Kerala we have already treated it as one,” Mr. Rijiju told The Hindu .

A letter dated August 16 sent by the Disaster Management division of the Union Home Ministry to the Rajya Sabha secretariat said the same. “It is to inform that as per information received from the State Government of Kerala, 247 human lives have been reported lost and 17,343 houses/huts have been reported damaged due to the floods/landslides in the State during south-west monsoon 2018. Keeping in view of the intensity and magnitude of floods /landslides in Kerala, this is a calamity of a severe nature for all practical purposes,” the MHA letter said.

Another official said an inter-ministerial team led by Mr. Rijiju visited Kerala to assess the situation and it is only done in circumstances when the natural calamity is of severe nature.

13 September 2018

After an arduous nine-hour journey, I finally reach Kozhikode (Calicut) after an arduous journey of nine hours. The journey has been heart-wrenching. About 2000 children are cramped into relief camps along with their parents and caregivers who have lost their valuables to incessant rain and floods.

Tomorrow — day two — should be even longer so we need to be prepared. Kuttanadu (the rice bowl of Kerala, also known as the Venice of the East) will have to crawl back to normalcy. My journey, just over 30 kilometers, took two hours.

Earlier in the day I visited four relief camps in Alappuzha which accommodates 8,000 people. In the middle of their misery the people here celebrate and honour the fishing community who have reached out to save lives. The camps do not have sobbing, cursing or stoic silence. Rather there is a calmness and determination etched on most faces. In the struggle for existence, saving lives and managing supplies, children’s needs are sometimes not at the forefront. The hope is that rehabilitation in Kuttanadu will provide an opportunity to rebuild better.

Driving through Ernakulam, 80 kilometers from Alappuzha and 200 kilometers from Thiruvananthapuram (the state capital), in my hired vehicle, I find a different scenario. The waters have receded and camps are closing. People who have returned to their houses in Paravoor realize the challenges ahead. They find heaps of slush inside their houses and no water to wash it out. No furniture left. No electricity. No utensils. No books and toys for children. An experience of total loss.

People return to find their cattle tied in the cowshed, the dog in chains and the chicken in the cage, all just ‘carcasses’. Then there is the accompanying stench; yet you cannot bury them because the water has not fully dried up.

When I saw my parents return last evening from the visit to our house, their tears and sorrow broke my heart The clouds that brought the downpour and wreaked havoc are visible in the faces of people who, with lowered heads, return to the camps.

“I was not having any problems till yesterday. When I saw my parents return last evening from the visit to our house, their tears and sorrow broke my heart,” said Saraswathy, a 12 year old girl from Paravoor.

UNICEF and government partner Childline have a team visiting the camps to set up play areas for children and to reduce the impact of trauma on them. A team from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences has also arrived today and psycho-social need assessment is in progress.

Although Kerala has not seen floods in the last 100 years, this disaster calls for long-term planning, which has benefited other states like Bihar and Odisha where floods wreak havoc every year. Their impact has been contained with long term, sustainable interventions.

The journey is long but with clear goals and milestones, we can achieve safety and protection for every child in Kerala.

In 2015, unprecedented and sudden floods paralysed Chennai with over 18 lakh people being displaced. Following this, at the behest of the office of the Principal Scientific Advisor to government of India, research institutions, chief among them the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), Chennai, and IITs, got together to build a flood warning system customised for use in Chennai. Carrying the acronym C-FLOWS, which stands for Chennai FLOod Warning System, the six-module ensemble can predict flooding due to heavy rainfall, sea-level rise and increase in water levels of the three rivers — Cooum, Adyar and Kosasthalaiyar — that traverse the city.

Ward-level data

“The State government shared data such as ward boundaries, population details, infrastructure available across Tamil Nadu, which have been used in the warning system,” says M. V. Ramana Murthy, Director, NCCR. The topography data was obtained from the Indian Remote Sensing programme. “Next we plan to develop such a system for Mumbai city and Cochin area,” he adds.

Knowing the elevation at different spots, the system can predict the way the area would flood based on different scenarios that have been simulated. Inputs were taken from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on forecast and National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF), which gives the prediction for rain 10 days in advance. Similarly, INCOIS gives the hydrodynamic congestion such as storm surge and tide etc. Using this, the system can, two weeks ahead of the event, simulate the scenario. “The system can predict what would happen at the level of individual wards,” says Tune Usha, scientist with the NCCR and one of the key persons behind the development of C-FLOWS. “We can now apply it to the Greater Chennai Corporation area of 462 sq. km,” she adds.

Thus, early warnings could be issued. “The flood itself cannot be avoided, but it can be managed and the disaster mitigated,” says Dr Usha.

The spatial database of the city which contains all administrative layers, details of ward boundaries, infrastructure, details of elevations and surfaces, soil, land use, geomorphology and census datasets are contained in the first module. There are many precomputed scenarios of flooding based on the forecast rainfall and tidal conditions, in a library. From this the most appropriate one may be selected for superimposing on the geomorphology. The second module has to do with this precisely. Simultaneously, models can also be run in real time based on actual datasets. Over this can be overlaid details of storm water drains and drainage fractions to enable pre-flood planning operations.

The 3D visualisation module makes possible a realistic visualisation of the flooding in various places such as infrastructure, buildings, roads, ward boundaries etc, by superimposing the model outputs on the layers of data.

Convergence

Data from IMD, NCMRWF, INCOIS and Tamil Nadu State government are brought together in an online hub along with the field data and the remote sensing data to observe the situation in real time. This is the fourth module.

Authorised personnel can use a mobile app, which has been developed alongside, to collect data from flooded areas such as geotagged photographs and add to the database. This fifth module helps capture the ground reality and provide primary information for decision makers to plan relief and mitigation operations.

The last aspect is a decision support system: this is an online GIS query portal which can answer questions on quantum of flooding in specific localities, flood proximity, for example, it can say which roads are inundated and suggest routes for planning relief operations and so on.

According to Dr. K Satyagopal, Principal Secretary and Commissioner, Revenue Administration and Disaster management, C-FLOWS will be integrated with TN-SMART, a portal being developed by his department.",solution,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city,1000 mm,USD 1 billion,500,18 lakh people displaced,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,error

On Sunday, Jose Mathew and others rescued by Jineesh and his friends were at the St.Thomas Church in Poonthura, to bid one last goodbye to the young man who saved their lives.

Twenty-three-year-old Jineesh had died on Saturday morning after he got involved in a road accident at Pazhaya Uchakkada.

Memorable image

One of the memorable images of him from the rescue mission is of him neck deep in the floodwaters, holding aloft 86-year old Rachel John on a chair, as he carries her into a waiting boat. Rachel’s daughter Leena Mathew, based on Texas, had lost hope of finding her parents when she got in touch with Jineesh’s group.

“My parents, both above 80 years of age, were alone in the house with just the house help for company. We had earlier got a wrong information that they were already rescued. Later, we got in touch with Jineesh’s group members through Facebook. They soon headed there and got them out safely. It’s quite sad that he left us so soon,” says Ms.Leena.

Also among those rescued by his group were 28 young children of an orphanage, following a particularly dangerous rescue operation, which even the Navy couldn’t take up.

Even after they got back home after the rescue operation, Jineesh and group were in constant touch with those rescued over phone.

“When we set out on August 16 night, he was the one who brought an extra engine from his home. Our group stayed there for five days and rescued close to 800 people. The irony is, his name does not even appear in the official list of rescuers, as we did not wait to enter our names at the taluk office, before heading to the rescue operation. Though he was one of the youngest among us, he was one of the bravest,” says Johny, one of the members of the group.

Jineesh had given up on his studies after completing Plus Two, to take up fishing and support his two younger brothers, both of whom have completed their degrees.

A short stint in the Middle East did not work out, causing him a loss of ₹2 lakh.

They had to shift out of their original home, situated close to the coast, three years ago as the battering of the waves had damaged the house badly.

They have been staying in a rented house since then.

The heart-rending wails of hundreds of men and women, young and old, accompanied him as his coffin was being carried to the sand-filled cemetery adjacent to the Poonthura church on Sunday afternoon.

“He had a big network of friends here. He was popular among the kids too, as a dancer and a cricketer. They all used to gather around every evening near the church. He has always been the first to volunteer for help for someone in need, despite his circumstances,” says Johny.",flood,Kerala floods,"Kerala, India","August 8, 2018","August 22, 2018","['Chengannur', 'Pathanamthitta', 'Alappuzha', 'Kottayam', 'Ernakulam', 'Idukki', 'Thrissur', 'Palakkad', 'Malappuram', 'Kozhikode', 'Wayanad']","['1144 mm in Aluva', '1092 mm in Cheruthoni', '1084 mm in Kozhikode', '1076 mm in Munnar', '1064 mm in Peermade', '1056 mm in Ponmudi', '1044 mm in Thiruvananthapuram', '1032 mm in Kalpetta', '1024 mm in Idukki', '1016 mm in Kottayam']","['Rs. 20,000 crore', '10,000 houses destroyed', '10 lakh people displaced', '800 people killed']",,"['Loss of crops', 'Damage to infrastructure', 'Waterborne diseases', 'Economic slowdown']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Navi Mumbai: The floods in Kerala have pushed the prices of spices imported from that State by at least 25%.

“Each spice has a season and they are kept in cold storage till the next season. So the prices of the spices in the storage have gone up as the crops in Kerala have been affected and there will be a shortage in the next season as well,” a trader from APMC market said on Tuesday.

The spices that come from Kerala are nutmeg (jaiphal), dry mace (javantri), cloves (lavang), green cardamom (elaichi/velchi), dry ginger (sonth), and black pepper (kali miri). Green cardamom comes only from Kerala while others are also imported from other countries.

Nutmeg that used to cost around ₹600 is now ₹800 per kg. Dry mace which was available between ₹1,300 and ₹1,800 per kg, is now priced between ₹1,500 and ₹2,100. Both these spices, which are also imported from Colombo, was stocked in June. Cloves which are largely procured from Indonesia are not much affected. “Cloves come from Kerala as well, but in a very limited quantity. It costs between ₹900 and ₹1,100 and there is a price rise of ₹50 to ₹100,” Bhavesh Vitha, a trader from APMC market, said.

Green cardamom which is traded only from Kerala is supplied twice a year: July and December. The rate of green cardamom which was between ₹1,100 and ₹1,200 now stands at ₹1,400 to ₹1,500. The price is expected to increase if the supply gets hit in December. “There will be fluctuations in the prices of the spices depending on the loss Kerala has suffered. As and when we get to know the condition of the crops there, there will be a change in prices,” Mr. Vitha said.

Dry ginger is supplied from Karnataka and Kerala, and also imported from Nigeria and China. The best among them is the one coming from Kochi, and it costs between ₹220 and ₹250 per kg, while earlier it was between ₹150 and ₹170.

Dry ginger is supplied in January, and this time, it is speculated that there will be a delay. “Since the spices don’t get spoilt, we have an option of storing them.

Currently, river Brahmaputra at Nimatighat in Jorhat, Dikhow at Sizasagar town, Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat and Jia Bharali at NT Road Crossing in Sonitpur are flowing above the danger mark. The water level in the Yamuna river rose to over 206 metre yesterday. On Monday, the Kerala government had issued an orange alert” in three districts as the water in Idukki reservoir came close to full storage level. It has sad that it would issue a “red alert” if the water-level reached a certain level, according to Indian Express report.

Generally three types of colours are used for issuing alert- “Orange”, “red” and “yellow alert”. The Central Water Commission uses this colour-coded system to alert local people in case of emergency. There are over 700 flood forecasting stations located across the country and a defined “warning level”, “danger level” and “highest flood level” for the river on which it is situated, the report says. The “warning and danger levels” are generally kept fixed for a river. However, highest flood level keeps changing and alteration is done based on the prevuious year’s record.

The colour-coded system works on the basis of the amount of water that flows in a river at a particular time. When the water in a river is “above normal flood” level, or between the warning and danger levels, a yellow alert is issued. When the river is in “severe flood”, or the level is between the danger and highest flood levels, authorities concerned issue “orange alert”. Authorities issue a red alert when the waters breach the highest flood level, the IE report said.

In Delhi, Yamuna was flowing at over 206 metre on Tuesday noon with the danger mark being 204.83 metres, officials said. The highest water level recorded at Old Yamuna Bridge was 207.49 metres in 1978.

devastating river floods have occurred in the past across the world, causing severe damage to life and property. Currently, 21 million people globally are affected by river floods every year (this figure may reach 54 million by 2030); India has the highest number of affected, at 4.84 million people, followed by China (3.48 million) and Bangladesh (3.28 million)—compare that to the US’s only 167,000. According to the World Resources Institute, 15 countries (least developed or developing) of the 169 countries surveyed account for 80% of the total number of people exposed to river floods in the world. The flurry of river floods during the last 2-3 decades has brought to the forefront the question: Are dams causing floods? The recent floods in Kerala seem to strengthen that view.

To my mind, this may not be true—because traditionally dams are considered as providing protection against floods, along with other benefits like generation of electricity (clean energy), irrigation and recharging of groundwater, etc, for socio-economic development of a country. Thus, it’s necessary to examine carefully, and scientifically, the real causes of river floods. Let’s assume that dams do cause floods. Then, should we put a moratorium on construction of dams and explore other alternatives to fulfil our requirements that dams are meeting today?

Suppose we do that in India, then what next? Taking the example of compensating for electricity generation, which dams provide us currently, we have to further enhance production of solar and wind energy—which we can do as there is abundant sunshine and wind in India, though at the cost of huge investment and the long time required. But can we be sure that solar and wind energy will not lead to any harmful effects in the future?

The answer is ‘no’. Today’s boon can become tomorrow’s bane—consider Industrial Revolution of the 19th century or the invention of plastic. Are we not stuck here? Let’s now discuss the other side of the story—that dams cannot be blamed for floods. Then, the question arises: What exactly is causing an increasing number of river floods? Researchers, scientists and environmentalists, after thorough investigation, have noted there are three main reasons for the same:

First, water in reservoirs of dams, at times, is allowed to be filled to the brim, so that there is no shortage of water for electricity-generation. And when there is a sudden downpour—which is increasingly happening in this era of climate change—the gates are suddenly thrown open to save dams from destruction. This is what happened in Kerala, where of the more than 50 dams, gates of about 30 dams, including of the large Idukki Dam, were thrown open. It should be understood that water has to be released intermittently, and for this it is necessary that advanced warning about heavy rains is provided to dam managers by the meteorological department and other weather forecasting agencies.

Second, there is total disregard for the environment while carrying out infrastructure development or developing human habitat, alongside fragile river banks and basins. Here, it appears we are not taking sufficient measures to ensure that proper drainage system is kept intact—it includes maintenance of the system and regular de-silting, so that excess water can be easily stored and channelised all the time. The recent deadly floods in Uttarakhand and J&K can be attributed to these reasons.

Third, unregulated and rampant mining—which destroys forests and leads to soil erosion—aggravates the occurrence of river floods. In Kerala, landslides, degraded soil and debris deposits due to quarrying and sand mining contributed substantially to the damage due to floods. Here, it must be mentioned that a report—by a committee headed by ecologist Madhav Gadgil in 2011—had warned that mining and hydropower dams are threatening the ecologically-sensitive areas of the Western Ghats because of reckless resource extraction, but, alas, the report was junked. Also, a government-backed report in June 2018, asserting that Kerala was at the risk of a big disaster, was not heeded to. Many districts in Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka, falling in the Western Ghats region, are other cases in point that have been badly affected in not too distant past by river floods. The above findings suggest that it is not dams, as such, but there are other reasons, as discussed, that are causing devastating floods. In view of this, measures need to be taken on a war-footing by central and state governments so that disaster due to floods can be sufficiently reduced:

Streamline and strengthen weather forecasting system about occurrence of heavy, long-duration rainfall (including cyclones, typhoons, hurricanes and other types of storms or tsunami) in this age of climate change, when sudden, extreme and variable weather conditions are the ‘new normal’;

Take into account the fragile ecology of various regions, states, towns while carrying out construction and mining activities, and pay heed to the advice of researchers in this respect;

Manage water reservoirs of dams efficiently, relating to usage of water for various purposes. To conclude, there is a need for a ‘national-level flood-control authority’ that takes care of all matters regarding flooding. This has not been done so far, though the Rashtriya Barh Ayog (National Flood Commission) was constituted 42 years ago, in 1976, by the government of India.

At least 205 locations in various parts of the city continue to be identified as ‘prone to flooding’. During the floods in 2015, the Chennai Corporation had identified 306 locations that were flooded.

Ahead of the northeast monsoon’s onset, the Chennai Corporation has prepared a disaster management plan to cope with inundation in these 205 localities, mapping areas in all 200 wards in the city.

Most of the flood-prone localities have been identified in the Perungudi zone near the Pallikaranai marsh. According to data , 48 locations in Perungudi including wards 169 and 191 are still prone to flooding. In ward 191, officials have identified 21 areas that are prone to inundation, the largest number identified in any ward.

Former Corporation Council Floor Leader V. Sukumar Babu said stormwater drains have been developed in some of the 205 flood-prone areas such as Razak Garden in ward 105 after the floods in 2015. “But there are challenges in desilting such drains and a delay in connecting them to disposal points,” Mr. Babu added.

‘Down since 2015’

During December 2015, inundation to the extent of five feet was reported in 37 localities such as MRC Nagar, Srinagar Colony and CIT Nagar. The civic body initiated measures to reduce severe flooding in such areas by developing drains and canals. “The number of locations with severe flooding has decreased since 2015,” an official said.

Major roads like the Nungambakkam High Road, Dr. Besant Road, Anna Salai, Avvai Shanmugham Salai and Dr. R.K. Salai feature in the civic body’s list of roads likely to get flooded this year.

The catastrophic floods that caused widespread havoc throughout the State last month have also released several alien species of fish into waterbodies, raising a threat to the endemic aquatic ecosystem and biodiversity, scientists have reported.

A joint research team which carried out a rapid assessment of the impact of the floods on waterbodies has documented the presence of 11 alien species, including the alligator gar ( Atractosteus spatula ), arapaima ( Arapaima gigas ), arowana, giant gourami, grass carp, kissing gourami, ( Helestoma temminckii ), koi carp, gold fish ( Carassius auratus ), shark catfish also known as Malaysian vaala, red-bellied pacu ( Piaractus brachypomus ) and three-spot gourami and four alien invasive species namely the East African catfish, common carp, tilapia (both cultivated and ornamental varieties) and sucker catfish.

The researchers from the University of Kerala, Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (KUFOS) and the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS), Bengaluru, have established that the alien species had escaped in large numbers from flooded commercial and ornamental fish farms.

Major route

“Globally floodwaters have proved to be a major route for the spread of invasive species and, therefore, a precautionary approach is warranted while farming potential invasives along floodplains,” says A. Biju Kumar, Professor, Department of Aquatic Biology and Fisheries, University of Kerala.

According to Rajeev Raghavan of KUFOS and the South Asia Coordinator of the IUCN’s Freshwater Fish Specialist Group, the proliferation of alien species poses a serious threat to the freshwater ecosystems of Kerala, considered a global hotspot for fish diversity, with about 200 freshwater species of fish, about 30 percentage of them endemic. The scientists have called for a ban on the import and farming of alien species like the arapaima and alligator gar.

Endemic to the Amazon, the Arapaima grows up to 4.5 metres in length and 200 kg in body weight, while the alligator gar, native to the US and Mexico, reaches a body length up to 3 m and and weighs around 137 kg. Both the species feed voraciously on fish and hence have the potential to cause serious threat to the indigenous fish in the rivers of Kerala.

Another escapee, the red-bellied pacu which was extensively cultivated in several districts, is currently caught in large numbers from the Vembanad and kole wetlands and backwaters of Kuttanad. A native of South America, it is omnivorous, devouring everything from fruits, seeds and nuts to insects, small fish, crustaceans and zooplankton.

The 2015 floods is seared in our collective memory; and we call it Chennai Floods and December Deluge. If you are a stickler for accuracy, it should be 2015 Coromandel Coast Floods or 2015 November-December Floods. For, it swept through Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry. And, before December, there were at least two episodes of heavy rains in November, contributing to the overall devastation along the Coast. But, everyone of us is naturally inclined to define even collective suffering in highly personalised terms, validating the exercise with our unique experiences. Each of these experiences is as essential to understanding the larger picture as is a jigsaw piece to solving a puzzle.

There are unique flood stories from Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR), because the region is dotted with lakes and many of these burst their embankments in November-December 2015.

There were stories of how HR managers of rival IT companies put their heads together to understand the situation and shape their response to it. There were also stories of servers being carried to safety; and of operations being shifted to other cities that were on dry ground.

For some of the IT professionals who were also residents of OMR, it was a double whammy. On the morning of December 1 this year, which marked the third anniversary of the floods, I met Thiyagarajan Sivakumar who personalises the 2015 Chennai Floods by calling it the Perumbakkam Floods.

Thiyagarajan is part of the mammoth IT workforce on OMR and a resident of Perumbakkam. He and his family had to abandon their apartment in Indira Priyadarshini Nagar three different times during the 2015 Chennai Floods. “On all the three occasions, the problem started on a Tuesday — November 17 and 24, and December 1. On November 17, the Perumbakam lake had broken its bunds and the water was chest-high. There was some flooding on November 24, not as serious as the previous one, but we did not want to take a chance. And the December rains were catastrophic. In our locality, there was enough water to submerge a six-footer and we had to be rescued in boats. A metal cot had to be placed on the first-floor sunshade for us to board the boats. We are in a low-lying area and surrounded by lakes and a wetland and therefore a sitting duck for lake bund-breaking rains,” recalls Thiyagarajan.

These stories have to be told and retold because they help residents to look for ways to protect themselves. Following the 2015 cataclysm, Indira Gurudev Colony Residents Welfare Association (which Indira Priyadarshini Nagar is a part of) has been keenly focussed on issues relating to rainwater drainage.

Thiyagarajan explains: “The natural course for rainwater in Perumbakkam is to flow from South to North. There was a unique system of floodwater drainage predating urbanisation of the area. Excess rainwater from Perumbakkam was designed to flow into Okkiyam Maduvu. From Okkiyam Maduvu, it would flow into the Buckingham Canal and then into the sea. So, when the culverts on the Medavakkam-Sholinganallur Road were done away with for the creation of stormwater drains, we sought alternative culverts to drain floodwater in a similar manner. Two months ago, three culverts were created on the Global Hospital Road. This system may not be bulwark against flooding of the kind that we experienced in December 2015. But it would certainly spare you the inconveniences we faced in November that year.”",error,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The Indian Space Research Organisation’s satellites and Doppler radars played a key role in weather monitoring and forecast, and provided critical inputs for various agencies involved in the rescue of stranded citizens during the floods in Kerala last month.

Pointing out that most of the districts in Kerala — mainly Iddukki, Patthanmthitta, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Palakkad — had received more than expected rainfall with a deviation of more than 164% in August, the space agency said it had monitored the whole event through its various satellites, helping the prediction and safety measures.

In just the first 20 days of the month, Kerala had received the highest rainfall for the entire month in 87 years, with Idukki district breaking a 111-year record for the highest rainfall for the month, as per the India Meteorological Department's records. This rainfall had triggered floods in several parts of the State and caused widespread havoc, according to the agency.

Weather monitoring

ISRO not only extended support through its space-based sensors, but ground-based sensors as well. Two of its radars — one C-Band Polarimetric Doppler Weather Radar (DWR) at TERLS, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Thiruvanthapuram and one S-Band DWR at Kochi — were continuously monitoring the weather on 24X7 basis up to 500 km radius.

The data was transferred to IMD, Meteorological and Oceanographic Data Archival Centre (MOSDAC), and Space Application Centre (SAC) for further data analysis and centralised weather monitoring. The information was made available in near real time for the public through the MOSDAC and IMD websites.

According to a press release by the ISRO, the radars had helped in long range weather surveillance, forecast and nowcast of the weather and rainfall activity in Kerala. The National Disaster Management Authority and Kerala State Disaster Management authority were continuously monitoring the data received by the radar and images were continuously updated on the IMD website for making decisions on various activities.

The DWR system provides quantitative information in digital form — the intensity and mean velocity of cyclones along with rainfall rate and accumulation. It improves the understanding and forecasting of thunderstorm, hailstorms, tidal wave height, wind turbulence and shear as well as the probable intensity of rain in and around the region, the press note said.

‘Gandipet ka paani’ and Hyderabadi biryani are the quintessential Hyderabadi’s building blocks.

This vast expanse of land would then be open to loot with government permission and more buildings will come up, with nary a thought to history and fantastic engineering skills.

Osmansagar was a major source of water supply, built near Gandipet to serve one million people of Hyderabad and Secunderabad.

The devastating floods of 1908 got the then Nizam thinking about safeguarding the city from such floods in the future and he wanted to plan the city properly. The seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan, did not want to use the services of the British and chose the renowned engineer-statesman and the Dewan of Mysore, Mokshagundam Visveswarayya for the job. Sir Visveswarayya had a proven track record in the field of flood control, water management and city planning, who was in turn ably helped by renowned engineer Nawab Zain Yar Jung.

The two lakes were planned in such a way that they would not only help control the flow of Musi but also provide an assured supply of potable water to the city.

The countryside survives on cheruvus or natural water tanks for its drinking requirements, cattle and irrigation. This was water harvesting at its best before it became a compulsion.

During the reign of the Kakatiya kings, several of the water tanks were strengthened and villages were encouraged to manage their own little water tanks.

The Qutb Shahi rulers continued this practice and added many more tanks of their own, in and around Golconda. A majority of those tanks were still full of water but pollution and greed have made them go dry, and their soft beds might become home to a concrete jungle if there is no fight against this continuous advance of builders.

Osmansagar with a storage capacity of 3.90 thousand million cubic feet has been a vital source of drinking water for Hyderabad ever since its creation in 1918, though the machinery had come in 1914.

The rocks where the dam was built have luckily been kept untouched, with a beautiful look-out point, built of stone. Reminiscent of the Titanica climb up here gives a bird’s eye view of the water and the ‘development’.

In a niche amongst these rocks is a small temple. Facing this and lost in dirt and oblivion is the foundation stone, laid in 1913, in the second year of rule of the Mir Osman Ali Khan. It is in Urdu and etched on white marble and pink granite.

The public is not allowed down these stone steps and so you do miss out on the foundation stone, which is tucked away in a niche, but the place is strewn with wafer packets and empty water bottles.

The temple celebrates its annual festival. Then the small gate is opened and people are allowed in. Wasps have built their hives in the inside of the railings.

It is said that 101 dynamite sticks were used to blast the rocky side of the gorge. A book on he subject goes on to say, “When the excitement had subsided, his Highness went down with the British Resident Colonel Pinhey to the bed of the river and made himself acquainted with what was being done on the spot.”

An aqueduct was built just outside of the dam walls and a pipeline was built using the natural gravity. With a wall 125 feet high, this was the biggest thing to be built in Hyderabad. It was a covered conduit 12 miles long and a pipe system which would supply water to one million people of the city. It cost '56 lakh to build the dam for flood protection and Rs 45 lakh to build Himayatsagar for irrigation.

There is an audible water level recorder, which is still in use. If one door is opened facing the water, you almost feel that you are the captain of a ship. This experience is not for the ordinary picknicker.

These two balancing tanks served several purposes, including supplying drinking water, taking care of irrigation for huge tracts of lands and controlling the Musi river. This dam has a spillway and so when it reaches a particular height the water flows down. With indiscriminate construction going on, it won’t be surprising if there is a lot of encroachment on the dry side of the lake.

It is said that 16 villages were submerged to create this lake which spread over 45 sq km. Hotels and weekend resorts were built on the sides of the lake, after the 1980s.

Apparently four crocodiles were brought by one such resort as an added attraction. After a terrorising incident, these creatures were released into the lake.

A warning board was put near the lawn telling people not to go too close to the water because of the crocodiles.

They have now gone away along with the waters but the board remains and certainly stops a few people from stepping near the lake.

When Gandipet started off as a picnic spot, just the sight of water and the greenery all around used to be enough. Food was always brought from home and that tradition continues. Two landscaped gardens still delight people who come here with families. Young couples walk the entire stretch of the dam to find a small little niche for some intimate moments.

There used to be a beautiful garden and a guest house near the aquaduct which is now overgrown by shrubbery, but still untouched by developers and is a soothing sight. Because the rate of construction is so swift and final in these areas, people must worry that their picnic spot will soon give way to ‘gated communities’ for the rich and the famous.

There is one little shop, with a lazy person behind the counter watching a film on his mobile, while two dogs get over-excited when they see visitors with packets in their hands.

In fact the tourism aspect of this place must be highlighted instead of giving way to “developers” who will bring only more cement and mortar to this place, which otherwise is home to birds, dragon flies and a cool breeze.

Surprisingly there are not too many eating joints en route to Gandipet. There are one or two dhabas and a few tea shops, but if you do not want to spend too much of money packing a snack or lunch would be the best idea. Any time of the day is a good time to come here, except during peak summer, when there is no shade. There are a couple of well known resorts close by but that is only if you want to splurge.

Gandipet is easily approachable, with the Outer Ring Road and Narsingi and then it is a straight drive. It could be a day time trip for a few hours and the use of toilets may not be needed then, but otherwise it would be a bit difficult if you want to stay longer with friends.",discussion,1908 Hyderabad floods,"Hyderabad, India",1908-09-01,1908-09-03,Hyderabad,100 mm,1000s of homes destroyed,100s,Major disruption to city life,"The floods were caused by heavy rainfall in the catchment area of the Musi river.

They waded and stumbled through waist-deep muddy water and slush for hours to reach a relief camp in Pandalam, in rain-ravaged Pathanamthitta district, Central Kerala. Dr Bijin Joseph, a specialist in family medicine, along with his medical team of 16, with three doctors, eight nurses and four pharmacists from KIMS hospital in Thiruvananthapuram, wanted to push on.

The raging waters of the Pamba prevented them from progressing further and fishermen warned them against attempting anything foolhardy. Instead, they promised to bring patients to their camp.

“It was pouring. I can never forget the sight of 500 people, young and old, huddled in that camp, because we have never seen a calamity on this scale in Kerala. While the youngsters were actively organising things at the camp, many senior citizens were completely in a state of shock. Many had seen their lives being washed away by the water — houses and all their possessions. It was traumatic for all of us too. We were on our feet from 10 am to 9 pm on some days. Our immediate concern was for patients who were on daily medication: those who had diabetes in need of insulin, those with hypertension and cardiac problems. Then there were many, specially young children, with cold and fever,” recalls Bijin. Through the six days, the team also worked in camps in Ranni, and Seethathodu, both in Pathanamthitta.

Stay alert Since volunteers and residents were forced to live in waterlogged areas and walk through flooded places, rat fever or Leptospirosis is a worry. All those who had to work or live in such conditions are given Doxycycline as a prophylactic medicine.

Snake bites are common in floods when the water recedes, so it is best to wear thick rubber gloves, gum boots and use mechanised equipment to clean houses and buildings.

Keep the skin dry to avoid skin infections and fungal infections. Consult a doctor in case of redness or itching.

To clean wells, flush out as much water as possible. Then opt for a process of super-chlorination: use upto 10g of bleaching powder for every 1,000 litres of water (usually only 2.5g is used). Let it stand for an hour.

Toll-free health line: 1800 1231454

In a relief camp in Seethathodu, he learnt that the area had experienced over 30 landslides in a week’s time. There were villages where houses were completely wiped out. The team had to treat fractures, cuts and bruises. “Two people had been killed and many families had their houses completely demolished by landslides and floods. They wondered what they had to return to,” narrates Bijin.

Meanwhile, a huge medical team set off from Thrissur Medical College to camps around Thrissur, in Central Kerala, under the leadership of orthopaedic surgeon Dr Santhosh Kumar, deputy superintendent of Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, and vice-president of Doctors Without Borders in South Asia. On the team were Dr Mohammed Asheel, Dr Bindu DHS, Dr Rahul UR.

“A mobile medical unit consisting of a doctor, nurse, and pharmacist was put together and 30 such teams travelled in a bus around Thrissur. There were 30 such buses for offering medical assistance in the camps. Our priority was to treat patients in need of help and also prevent the outbreak of any contagious diseases (measles, chicken pox, typhoid, cholera, diarrhoea). Since thousands of people are living together, it is easy for a contagious disease to reach the levels of an epidemic,” says Santhosh. He also led a team to Wayanad, aided by an NSS squad from Delhi.

As the waters recede, there are bound to be manifold new issues in the days to come, says Santhosh, who has treated patients hit by various disasters in over 30 countries. “As the camps are being closed, the threat of an outbreak of contagious diseases has decreased greatly. However, since the water has still not receded in many places in Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta districts, and since people have begun to return to their homes, there are other problems to look out for,” he explains.

It is also at this stage of such a calamity that respiratory diseases must be carefully monitored. A simple viral infection that results in a cough or cold, can get escalated to become something more serious, like pneumonia.

An immediate concern is a spike or occurrence of rat fever, because of the lack of proper footwear, such as gumboots. Then there is the danger of snake bite and fatal injuries caused by electrical equipment damaged by the flood waters.

Since almost all the wells in these regions have been contaminated, all the sources of drinking water will have to be pumped, cleansed and super-chlorinated, before they can be used.

Even as the water is still going down, vector-borne diseases rear their heads. When the sun comes up and water starts stagnating, the whole life cycle of mosquitoes begins anew.

Based on his experience in working in flood-hit Philippines and Odisha, he says it would be best to use mosquito nets for protection or use mats and ointments to protect oneself from dengue and Japanese encephalitis.

The floods in Kerala are said to be the worst in a century, since 1924.

The doctors also point out the immediate necessity of organising psycho-social support groups to counsel many of the survivors of the flood. “The plan is to select about 200 volunteers and train them to identify, select and counsel those undergoing emotional stress or trauma. The best way is to have such trained volunteers at clinics, so that they can identify people in need of counselling,” says Santhosh.

As the State moves into the process of rehabilitating the survivors, medical practitioners gear up for more work, not letting the grief of their own losses come in the way of duty and service.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Mr. Vijayan thanked UAE president Sheikh Khalifa bin Syed Al Nahyan, the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince, and Vice President and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum for the generous gesture.

The UAE government had communicated the decision to provide assistance to Kerala when Gulf-based industrialist M.A.Yusuffali called on the Crown Prince.

“For Malayalis, the Gulf was a second home and the ties between Malayalis and Gulf nations was deeply emotional. The offer of assistance reflected the concern that Gulf nations had for Kerala and Malayalis,” the Chief Minister said.

NCMC meets

The National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) met for the sixth time in a row on Tuesday with Cabinet secretary P.K. Sinha in the chair to review the rescue and relief operations in the State. State Chief Secretary Tom Jose participated in the meeting via video conference and informed the NCMC members that the situation had improved considerably and that only some isolated pockets were still under water.

As many as 32 persons were still missing on Tuesday even as rescue operations to bring to safety marooned persons is almost coming to an end. The focus of the government has shifted to post-flood relief operations.

Of the 32 still missing as per the Disaster Management State Control Room, Thrissur district accounts for 20 persons, followed by seven in Idukki district, three in Wayanad district and two in Palakkad district.

The Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel rescued 15 persons on Tuesday, including 11 from Nelliyampathy, a hill station in Palakkad district, hit by landslips and flashfloods.

Five deaths were reported on Tuesday taking the toll in the monsoon fury since August 8 to 228. Three deaths were reported from Alappuzha district and two from Idukki district.

In the past week, Whatsapp and FB has been buzzing with photographs of snakes and reptiles found in people’s homes — coiled on ledges, around window bars, underneath the sofa in the living room, on the gas cylinder and places where one would least expect them. Humans are not the only creatures that have been displaced by the floods that ravaged the State.

As the waters recede, reptiles that have had their burrows filled with water are seeking refuge in people’s homes. In Desom, Aluva, one of the worst hit places outside Ernakulam, a home-maker is believed to have found 35 snakes in her house, which she claims to have killed. In Pariyaram, Chalakkudy, a crocodile was found which was duly handed over to the Forest Department by the people. In and around Paravur alone, around 45 snake-bite cases have been reported. The Medical College Hospital at Kalamassery has opened a department for snake bite and anti venom is being made available at more hospitals.

Animal lovers across the State are co-ordinating efforts to spread awareness that the animals are as scared as people are and in need of rescue. “Just as people have taken shelter at relief camps, these creatures have taken refuge at your homes. Please seek help from snake rescuers, instead of killing them,” says Vidya Raju, a snake rescuer from Ernakulam. She is just back from volunteering work at Aluva where she helped clean out the debris from a house. Residents who are going back to their houses that were inundated have to exercise caution, especially while removing soggy mattresses, and curtains. The snakes tend to coil around curtain rods, says Vidya. “Never put your hand directly and in case one finds a reptile, use a stick or rod to guide it outside the house”, she adds.

The snakes that have commonly been found in the aftermath of the flood are the spectacled cobra (moorkhan), krait (anali) in the venomous category and rat snakes (chera), common kukri (banded snake) and python (malampambu) in the non-venomous category, says Arun Prakash Lal, snake rescuer and the State secretary of Snakes and Wild Animals Rescuers Association (Swara), a Whatsapp group of snake rescuers and snake lovers. Formed around two years ago by snake lovers, the group has over 250 members from Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod and it has collated a list of snake rescuers in each part of the State, who can reach the spot and engage in the rescue. “Along with IndiaSnakes.org, we are going to the infested places and helping in the rescue without any remuneration.”

Spreading falsehood

Arun points out that spreading falsehood through social media is detrimental in a situation such as this. “A harmless amphibian, hammerhead worm, has been termed as an extremely dangerous creature and Whatsapp messages about it have been creating panic.”

Sajinesh TP, one of the members of Swara, adds: “Most of the snakes that people have been killing are not even the poisonous variety.” The rescuers advise against untrained people trying to catch the snakes to protect themselves and the animal.

The Chennai Animal rescue team of volunteers have come to help with snake rescue missions in and around Chengannur, Thiruvalla and Kochi. A doctors’ Whatsapp group, which has snake bite experts from different States are also in action.

The flood situation in Alappuzha district turned worse on Thursday. Several places in Chengannur, Kuttanad, and Ambalapuzha taluks have been isolated following an alarming rise in the water level.

Several people stranded at homes have been rescued and shifted to relief camps. Officials, however, said an unknown number of people were still stuck at their homes and buildings in Chengannur and Kuttanad taluks and steps were being taken to rescue them. The areas including Chengannur, Pandanad, and Edanad have been completely isolated. The flood situation remains grim at Thiruvanvandoor, Vazhar, and Mangalam.

Standstill

In Kuttanad region, the life has come to a standstill for the second time in a month owing to floods.

People have started fleeing the region to safer places, leaving everything behind. Officials said steps had been taken to evacuate around 25,000 people from Veliyanad. Kainakary, Pulinkunnu, Chambakulam, Edathua, and Ramankary were badly affected.

An Indian Navy helicopter has been pressed into action to evacuate the stranded people in the region. The Indian Coast Guard (ICJ), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) have also been deployed in the affected areas.

More than 200 relief camps and 483 gruel centres have been opened in different parts of the district for 1.25 lakh people.

District Collector S. Suhas has convened an emergency meeting of all department heads in the district and take stock of the situation.

Water level has risen in the region following heavy rains and after the shutters of the Kakki, Anathodu, and Kochu Pampa reservoirs, part of the Sabarigiri hydroelectric project, in Pathanamthitta district were opened.

Authorities have urged the people living near the riverbanks to exercise caution and comply with the directions issued by authorities. In case of an emergency, people should contact 1077, 0477- 2238630, and 2243721.

The summer monsoon is a regular feature this time of year in India, and it can bring heavy rains to the region. However, periodically areas of low pressure can form within the general monsoon trough and bring even more rain.

Kerala is facing its worst floods in nearly a century that has left at least 231 people dead, and forced 3.14 lakh people out of their homes. The Centre has declared this calamity of ‘severe nature’.

Rainfall accumulations from August 13 to 20 showed two bands of heavy rain across India, NASA said in a statement.

The first band appeared much broader and extends across the northern part of the peninsula with weekly rainfall totals ranging from over 5 inches towards the western half of the peninsula to as much as 14 inches over parts of the eastern half towards the Bay of Bengal.

The first band is associated with the general monsoon circulation.

The second band appeared more concentrated and intense and is closely aligned with the southwest coast of India and the Western Ghats where onshore flow was enhanced by an area of low pressure embedded within the general monsoon.

Weekly rainfall totals in this band are generally over 10 inches with embedded areas exceeding 16 inches. The maximum estimated value from the data in this band was 18.5 inches, NASA said.

Although the extreme Himalayan topography is much more well-known, another contributing factor to the heavy rains along the southwest coast of India is the Western Ghats, it said.

Though much smaller than the Himalayas, this mountain range runs parallel to the West Coast of India with many peaks over 2,000 metres.

As a result, the Western Ghats are well positioned to enhance rainfall along the West Coast of India as they intercept the moisture laden air being drawn in off the warm waters of the northern Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea as part of the southwest monsoon circulation.

The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is used to estimate precipitation from a combination of passive microwave sensors, including microwave sensor and infrared data.

The data is generated every half an hour, thereby allowing scientists to track rainfall across the globe almost in real time.

The day started with a heritage walk in the old city, led by Sirisha Indukuri, where 23 participants visited Purana Pul Dawzara, Miya Mishk Mosque and Old Shiva temple and relived the heritage. Elaborating about the whole initiative, Prshant Lahoti, Managing Trustee, Krishnakriti Foundation, says, “Heritage is not just in our monuments and historical artefacts but in everyday experiences, and memories and that’s the reason we came up with this initiative.”

Later in the evening, the inauguration of the exhibition of original photographs of the 1908 flood from the collection of Kalakriti Archives was held which included a selection of rare archival images produced by W. R. Puplikc and Co between 1908-09. “This is a rare opportunity to view a set of photographs from over a hundred years ago. The aesthetic, and technical brilliance is at par with the detailed content captured in these rare historical moments. This is a unique experience for everyone interested in the history of Hyderabad,” shares Abeer Gupta, director, Krishnakriti Foundation.

The guests in the evening also got the opportunity to know a bit more about the floods from noted historian Sajjad Shahid who gave a talk on ‘Memories of the Flood’, which was followed by folk music performances about the flood, in the Musi River, moderated by Dr Anand Raj Varma.

After Kochi airport was flooded on August 15, airlines were asked to fly to Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode. Meanwhile, on August 16, the Civil Aviation Ministry proposed that Kochi’s naval airbase be used for civilian flights.

Joint Secretary Usha Padhee created a WhatsApp group connecting the ministry, Kerala’s Chief Secretary, and the important players in Kochi. In less than 30 hours, regulatory agencies conducted a test flight at the naval facility, and security equipment like x-ray machines and baggage scanners from Thiruvananthapuram were shifted in.

Airlines started flights with smaller ATR planes from August 20, five days after Kochi airport was forced to close.

Civil Aviation Secretary R.N. Choubey praised Alliance Air, Bureau of Civil Aviation Security, and ground handling personnel, among others, for going beyond the call of duty. “It has been a heroic effort on the part of government agencies, whose own family members were trapped or stranded. CISF jawans even volunteered to swim to the Naval airbase! In particular, the Indian Navy rose to the occasion, because their establishment was already fully stretched carrying out relief operations.”

Vistara, which flew only to Kochi, set up a new station in Thiruvananthapuram in 14 hours, something that normally takes weeks. Chief Strategy and Commercial Officer Sanjiv Kapoor credits the airport authorities for giving them vacant slots and check-in desks, and regulatory agencies for coming together to expedite processes. “Everybody said, let’s make it happen.” Other airlines also quickly re-routed flights.

Aside from waiving cancellation and rescheduling charges and capping fares, many airlines joined in the relief efforts. IndiGo carried in nearly 30 tonnes of relief material, Vistara 15 tonnes, and Jet Airways over 10 tonnes. Vistara also ferried in doctors, nurses, disaster management experts and skilled volunteers for free.

Flash floods marooned at least 3,000 families in Tripura, where incessant rain triggered mudslides that have killed six people, including three of a family, in the past four days. Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb declared financial assistance for the victims’ families. Shelter has been provided in 36 makeshift camps.

Above danger level

Several localities in Agartala are submerged, while water was flowing above the danger level in three rivers.

The District Magistrate of West Tripura district, Sandip Mahate, said, “Due to incessant rains last night in Sadar and Jirania sub-division and in several wards of Agartala Municipal Corporation, the water of Haora River is flowing at 10.3 m which is .3 m above the danger level.”

“The affected people along the river banks have been shifted to flood relief camps...The administration has arranged for ample food supply and drinking water,” he added.

Officials said the flood situation remains grim owing to torrential rains in the hills in north Tripura, the source of all major rivers of the State.

Low-lying areas are the worst affected, requiring evacuation of people.

A portion of the Assam-Agartala National Highway has also flooded, disrupting normal traffic. Schools have been declared closed in several places.

Tripura Education Minister Ratan Lal Nath inspected some flood-affected areas. “Due to a sudden downpour in the hilly areas, the Balda Khal, Chandrapur and adjoining areas are flooded as the water level in rivers have increased, due to which, the water is unable to pass to Bangladesh,” he told reporters.

“I have instructed the authorities to provide all support to people marooned in flood water,” he said.

District officials on Monday said the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), fire services, defence personnel and volunteers are jointly working to help affected people.

The regional office of the Meteorological Department has issued a warning with the prediction of more rainfall in the next 24 hours.

Sir M Visvesvaraya Tamed Hyderabad’s Floods for Decades?,"While most Indians know about Visvesvaraya's immense contributions as the Diwan of Mysore, few are aware that the legendary engineer also played a key role in making Hyderabad flood-free way back in the 1900s.

A statesman, economist and engineer par excellence, Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya was one of India’s foremost nation-builders. Born on September 15, 1861, in Muddenahalli (in modern-day Karnataka), he completed his school education in Chikkaballapur and Bengaluru. After graduating in engineering in 1883, he joined Bombay’s Public Works Department as an assistant engineer and worked there for the next 25 years.

However, Visvesvaraya attained the pinnacle of his professional achievement during his tenure as the Chief Engineer (and later Diwan) of the kingdom of Mysore. Every initiative he started during this period continues to bear rich fruit even to this day – from the State Bank of Mysore, Mysore University and Mysore Paper Mills to Bhadravati Iron Works and Krishnaraja Sagar Dam.

While most Indians know about Visvesvaraya’s immense contributions as the Diwan of Mysore, few are aware that the legendary engineer also played a key role in making Hyderabad flood-free way back in the 1920s.

On the occasion of his 156th birth anniversary, also celebrated in India as Engineer’s Day, we bring you this little-known story about Sir M V Visvesvaraya.

In 1908, Visvesaraya had opted for voluntary retirement (from his job at Bombay’s PWD) and embarked on a world tour to study the systems and designs prevalent in the industrialised countries of the western world. Armed with a brilliant vision for the development of modern India, he returned home in 1909.

When Visvesvaraya was touring the world, Hyderabad was being battered by a devastating flood. In September 28, 1908, the river Musi had flooded the streets of the city after torrential rainfall due to a cloudburst. As the water poured into the small irrigation tanks dotting the city, their overburdened walls of the tanks gave way under the pressure.

The flood level rose to unprecedented heights, leaving a trail of death and destruction in its wake. Nearly 19000 houses collapsed, about 15000 lives were lost and around 1 lakh people, (roughly one-quarter of the city’s population) were left homeless.

At least 12 such floods had been caused by the river Musi in the past but the devastation caused in by the deluge in 1908 was unprecedented. The sixth Nizam of Hyderabad, Mahboob Ali Khan, personally supervised rescue operations and distributed relief supplies among the floods victim. He also threw open the gates of the royal palaces for the victims while the royal kitchens fed over 5 lakh of them for several days.

Mahboob Ali Khan also took several measures to combat a similar flood in the future, including commissioning Visvesvaraya as an adviser and consultant for Hyderabad’s flood management plan. The British had wanted to send their own expert but the Nizam had heard of Visvesvaraya’s engineering expertise and decided to choose him for this crucial project.

Visvesvaraya agreed to conduct a study and suggest flood-management measures for the city on two conditions – that he would be paid the same salary as the British expert, and that he would be free to employ anybody he liked. Once these conditions were accepted, he got down to the job with his customary thoroughness.

Visvesvaraya began by collecting and studying data on the rainfall received in different parts of India, especially the neighbouring provinces of Bombay and Madras. He also conducted a detailed survey of Hyderabad’s network of rivers and reservoirs before devoting time to understanding the engineering aspects of the problem.

The solution devised by Visvesvaraya involved creating storage reservoirs above the city that would control floods by storing water that exceeded the river’s carrying capacity. He submitted the report on October 1, 1909, along with other recommendations for improving the flood-resilience of civic amenities. This included the establishment of a City Improvement Board and an allocation of 2 million rupees per year for the next six years for flood prevention works.

Here’s an excerpt from his 1909 report, titled ‘The Flood of 1908 at Hyderabad – An Account of the Flood, Its Causes and Proposed Preventive Measures’:

“The flood embankments on both sides will be carried out to a height of 5 feet above the flood level. For greater part of their length, these embankments will be constructed along boulevard…These boulevards will be the lungs of the city. The poor, who are the ones largely using footpaths and roads, will benefit as much as the rich, by clean, shaded, well kept roadways and graceful surroundings…its of greatest importance that the Government does not miss this opportunity to render the riverfront healthy and picturesque.”

Visvesvaraya’s solutions were accepted with alacrity and work commenced on the construction of two storage reservoirs — Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar — above the city of Hyderabad (one across the river Musi and another across its tributary, river Esi), along with a modern system of underground drainage.

Damaged walls were rebuilt, existing bunds were strengthened and the area between the Char Minar and river Musi was also reconstructed after the Aaraish-e-Balda (City Improvement Board) was established in 1912. The squalid and overcrowded residential areas along the river bank were transformed into parks and boulevards beyond which the Osmania General Hospital, the High Court and the State Central Library were constructed.

In 1911, Mahbub Ali Pasha passed away and the seventh Nizam, Mir Osman Ali Khan, took over the implementation of the plan. Osman Sagar was completed in 1920 and Himayat Sagar in 1927, proving to be a turning point for the people of Hyderabad. River Musi’s frequent floods were tamed for many of the coming decades.

However, subsequent rulers and governments did little to improve the flood management system designed by Visvesvaraya, even as Hyderabad expanded in leaps and bounds. In August 2000, torrential rains wreaked havoc again. The City of Pearls experienced one of the worst floods seen since 1908, with as many as 90 residential areas in the city being submerged under water.

With Hyderabad reeling under the threat of a massive flood yet again, maybe it’s time to draw inspiration from India’s most prolific civil engineer and devise an effective flood management plan for the city. There could be no better way to celebrate the memory of the man who once made Hyderabad flood-free.

Thanks to encroachment, several lakes, including Banda Cheruvu in East Anandbagh, overflowed. Heavy rains in Keesara and Shamirpet, the catchment area, pushed rainwater down to RK Puram lake, Safilguda lake and Banda Cheruvu. The nala which should be more than 10 metres wide has shrunk to two metres in Anandbagh and other areas of Malkajgiri and so failed to carry away the rain water.

GHMC Commissioner B. Janardhan Reddy said there are always problems in urban areas when more than 15 centimetres of rain falls. “Any city drainage system is designed only to carry 2 cm of rain water. It was recommended 10 years ago to have nalas that were a minimum of nine metres wide, but it is hardly two metres wide. Keesara recorded 17 centimetres of rain. There are no gauges at Safilguda, RK Puram and Banda Cheruvu. Due to heavy rains these lakes overflowed, but there is no breach at any lake,” Mr Reddy said. The rain water overflowing from lakes and nalas flooded colonies en route up to Uppal via Lalapeta and Nacharam.

The GHMC commissioner said that the “behavioural patterns” of people is also responsible for the flooding. “Plastic bags, papers, garbage, damaged furniture, etc are thrown into the nala, and get stuck at the culvert, reducing the capacity. Bandla Cheruvu was once 102 acres in area; it has now shrunk to 39 acres due to encroachments. These floods are localised, restricted to Kapra, Malkajgiri and Uppal,” Mr Reddy said. Superintending engineer of GHMC’s Disaster Management Cell, R Mohan Singh, said, “The nala was encroached and has shrunk to 1.8 metres at Patelnagar, NMDC Colony, Durganagar, Vasanthapuri areas.”

8 rescued from swollen Musi

Eight persons, including six from a family, who were stuck in the swollen Musi river in Valigonda mandal in Nalgonda district were rescued by NDRF teams on Thursday. The victims had gone to a temple located in the middle of the river for special puja. Sources said S. Jahangir, a farmer from Redlapaka village in Valigonda mandal and his wife Lakshmamma, Jangulu, Alivelu, Venkatesham and a temple priest named Chari were rescued by NDRF.

On Thursday morning, they had gone to the Bhimalingam temple located in the middle of the river. Around 12 pm the river became swollen due to the rise in flow and they rushed to the temple roof. After a couple of hours they informed villagers over the phone and they informed the police. Revenue and police officials swung into action and soon NDRF teams arrived. Meanwhile, two other persons from the fishermen community got stuck in the river and they took to the rocks for safety. They were also rescued.

Hyderabad recorded 13 centimetres of rain over a period of five hours as heavy rains lashed the city after a cloudburst on Monday evening.

People returning to the city after the end of a festive season were stranded in the outskirts of Hyderabad as traffic came to a grinding halt on all highways connecting the capital city of Telangana. Several roads, colonies and the low-lying areas remained water-logged until late night on Monday due to poor drainage.

City dwellers opted to stay indoors, thereby, averting a nightmarish experience on a public holiday. However, road routes that remain busy such as",the one connecting the city to the airport were water-logged. flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

However, despite what its name suggests, the variety is grown within the country itself. Vendors say that they purchase the fruit from the wholesale market of Gaddiannaram in LB Nagar and from Mozamjahi market. Each fruit weighs around 300 to 500 grams, and is sold for between Rs 100 and Rs 150 per kg.

“Customers are buying it because of its unique appearance and red pulp. The fruit arrives from Bengaluru every morning and we buy it from wholesalers,” says Abdul Khadeer, a fruit vendor at Charminar. According to Mr Tajuddin, a wholesaler at the Gaddianaram fruit market, the Thai guava is grown by several farmers in Bengaluru and Mysore. “The plants were grafted, by horticulturists, from the original Thai guava species, hence the name,” he says. The Thai guava is sold by wholesalers for Rs 30 to Rs 40 per kg, and retailers mark up the price by over Rs 100 per kg. “It has a shelf life of up to a week,” says a wholesaler.

Researchers have named the variety VNR-Bihi. It produces much larger fruits than regular guava plants. “Farmers in Bengaluru and other places are opting to grow it because of the premium price that it fetches,” says a researcher. Guavas that are actually imported from Thailand are only available at select retail outlets, and that too at a much higher price of '300 per kg. M.A. Khadeer of Golden Fruit Palace in Moazamjahi Market says that about 200 kg of the fruit arrives in the city from New Delhi. “A few big firms import the fruit and supply it within the city. Retail vendors buy only two to three kg at a time, depending on the local demand. A few families buy it for their own consumption; it is mostly bought to be presented as a gift during marriage ceremonies or for iftar parties during Ramzan,” he says.

He adds that the pulp of the fruit actually imported from Thailand is pink, not red. Dr M. Vijaya, the dean of research at the Sri Konda Laxman State Horticulture University, says that a local variety of guava from Kohir in Sangareddy is also famous for its red pulp. Habeeb Mohammed Baghdadi, a fruit vendor from Barkas, says that the area was once renowned for its red pulp guavas. “There was a huge demand for it because it was believed that red guavas had medicinal properties. But the trees were chopped ten years ago, after a pest attack. Eventually, that variety became extinct,” he says.",discussion,2023 Hyderabad floods,"Hyderabad, Telangana, India","July 17, 2023","July 20, 2023","['Hyderabad', 'Secunderabad', 'Gachibowli', 'Kukatpally', 'L.B.

Click here

This is the worst flooding since 2005 when, in 24 hours to 8.30am on July 27, 2005, in its worst ever flooding, Mumbai witnessed 944mm of rain, with more than 500 people dying in that flood.

The rain came down in Mumbai much as it had in Chandigarh on the morning of August 21, 2017. By afternoon, the joint capital of Punjab and Haryana had received 112 mm of rainfall, 23 times the city’s average daily monsoon rainfall. Similarly, on August 15, Bengaluru received 37 times, and on August 11-12 Agartala received more than 11 times its average daily monsoon rainfall of the last five years.

In Chandigarh, a city of 1 million, commuters found it difficult to reach their destinations, and some had to abandon their cars and motorbikes on the roads. Many vehicles floated in the water–a reminder of similar images from Chennai during the November-December 2015 floods. Water entered buildings, and the urban administration of the country’s best-planned city descended into chaos.

Independence Day 2017 was unusually wet and waterlogged for Bengaluru. Heavy rains started around midnight, and by morning, 128 mm of rain had cascaded down on the city of 9 million. Localities in and around Koramangala in the southern part of the city went under water, with parked vehicles nearly submerging.

On August 11 and 12, 2017, a heavy downpour drowned Agartala, the capital of Tripura in northeastern India. While the city of 438,000 received 102 mm of rainfall in one day, on the next there was 94 mm, and 196 mm in two days was more than the city could take. The city’s systems collapsed, and normal life was disrupted.

On July 26-27, 2017, the downpour was in Ahmedabad, where within 24 hours the city of 5.5 million received 200 mm of rainfall. To make matters worse, due to heavy rainfall in the upper part of the Sabarmati river catchment, the authorities had to release water from the Dharoi dam. With the river hemmed in by perpendicular, concrete riverbanks as it flowed through Ahmedabad, there were serious threats of heavy flooding, and the administration reportedly evacuated more than 10,000 people.

In the monsoon months of July to September, between 2012 and 2016, Mumbai’s suburban district received an average rainfall of 18.54 mm. As we said, Mumbai received more than 11 times this amount in under 12 hours on August 29, 2017.

With such cloudbursts becoming more frequent across India, these are the questions scientists are considering: Is the prognosis of extreme weather events becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change beginning to come true? Are Indian cities designed to withstand such events? What can be done to make them more resilient?

Increased rainfall intensity in a time of climate change

Recent research indicates that the intensity of these extreme weather events is increasing, according to Pradeep Mujumdar, chairman, Interdisciplinary Centre for Water Research (ICWaR) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. Also, the intensity of urban events vis-à-vis non-urban ones is increasing.

“Though it is difficult to attribute any one event to climate change, there is much research results from across the world that is showing that the pattern of multiple extreme events in a season is happening due to the changing climate,” Mujumdar told indiaclimatedialogue.net, a website dedicated to climate-change reportage.

Chennai had a series of five “extreme precipitation events”, in scientific parlance, between November 8 and December 4, 2015. Before the city could recover from one event, it was battered by the next. The climax was the release of water from the Chembarambakkam reservoir upstream of the city, causing the Adayar river to jump its banks in Chennai.

The secondary runway of the Chennai airport, built over the Adayar river, was flooded and airport services were paralysed for days. To evacuate those who wanted to leave the city and were stuck at the airport, the Indian Navy helped operate civilian flights from the naval air base at nearby Arkonam.

ICWaR has been studying the urban flooding events in Chennai, Hyderabad and Bengaluru in recent years. For Bengaluru, the team compared 26 general circulation models (or global climate models) along four “representative concentration pathways”–greenhouse gas emission scenarios up to year 2100, used by the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The conclusion: Climate change projections clearly indicate an increase in high-intensity rainfall.

Another report, published by the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bengaluru, confirms similar findings: Rain events greater than 100 mm have increased in number in the past 100 years, researchers Jagdish Krishnaswamy and Srinivasan Vaidyanathan wrote. There is an overall increasing trend of events exceeding 100, 150 and 200 mm since the 1900s. But there is an increasing variability in recent decades.

However, attributing a single event to climate change remains problematic.

It was not possible to attribute the extreme rainfall in Chennai on December 1, 2015, to climate change, a team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, and the University of Oxford in the UK, said in a 2016 study.

Taken by surprise, cities struggle to predict rainfall intensity and its impact

It is this variability in rainfall that takes cities by surprise. Professional weather watchers of the India Meteorological Department and private individuals and agencies are able to say that it is going to rain over a particular city, but they cannot foresee its intensity and impact.

To improve prediction, global climate models developed by the IPCC need to be reconstructed for cities, said scientists.

Due to their higher population density, cities are vulnerable to greater loss of life and property than rural areas. Chennai, for instance, has a population density of 26,553 people per sq km.

Extreme rainfall also leaves cities at greater economic risk. The economic loss to Chennai from the flood of 2015 was estimated to be $3.5 billion (Rs 21,381 crore), according to annual estimates compiled by global reinsurance major Munich Re.

If extreme rainfall events become more frequent, cities need to be prepared for extreme flooding. They do not appear to be.

Why cities are not prepared for extreme rainfall

In Bengaluru, storm water networks are either blocked or not adequate, according to Veena Srinivasan, fellow at ATREE. Many of these drains also carry sewage, which should be separated and treated. With sewage mixing with stormwater, it is difficult to channel the excess rain water into local lakes.

Garbage also finds its way into and obstructs stormwater drains, floating out when they overflow.

Changing urban land use disallows water from soaking into the ground. “In normal grounds outside the city, nearly 80% of the rain is absorbed,” G K Bhat, chairman of Ahmedabad-based Taru Leading Edge, a development think tank, told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “Today, with concrete and tarmac all around, we are creating almost a near-total impervious area. Thus, the flood gets amplified in urban areas because of change in land use.”

While the July 2017 flood in Ahmedabad was not the most severe in the city’s history, it had a greater impact than in the past because of growing concretisation of open land.

In Chennai, the release of water from the Chembarambakkam reservoir upstream of the Adayar river on December 1, 2015, was thought to have triggered floods along the river. However, later studies proved that the reservoir water only added to water flowing in from the southwestern suburbs of the city beyond Tambaram.

“The main flow in the Adayar river was coming from these suburbs, and the Chembarambakkam flow only added to this,” Balaji Narasimhan, associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, told indiaclimatedialogue.net. “In future, when these suburbs have more buildings and roads, the amplification of the flood could be even higher.”

Existing infrastructure is inadequate and prone to collapse

With the exception of planned cities, such as Chandigarh, and industrial townships, such as Bhilai and Jamshedpur, most Indian cities grow organically from a cluster of villages and small towns. Cities grow without adequate infrastructure, and whatever exists is inadequate for extreme rainfall.

“The existing infrastructure collapses quickly because it is designed for minor floods and not the kind of extreme events that we are seeing in the recent years,” said Bhat. “Even though guidelines have been laid out by the National Disaster Management Authority, urban planners and managers go for designs calibrated for milder events to reduce cost.”

Ironically, when Chennai flooded in 2015, it was the stormwater infrastructure laid down by the British more than a century ago in the older parts of the city that withstood the brunt better than drains installed in the newer parts of the city.

Without redesigning their infrastructure and preparing for extreme weather, India’s cities will increasingly succumb to its ravages.

It has been the sorrow and pride of Hyderabad and its predecessor city of Golconda for over five centuries of recorded history.Musi was the lifeline of Hyderabad and Golconda for centuries before it turned into a municipal gutter.As Hyderabadis remember the Great Deluge of September 28, 1908, a look into the flood and drought history of the Musi River over the last 500 years reveals that the river had been a natural enigma for foreign travellers, historians and chroniclers, who visited Golconda kingdom and Hyderabad during the Qutub Shahi regime.The Musi is perhaps the only river in India that has been associated with a legendary royal love affair that had pro mpted the ruler to build a bridge to protect his heir apparent from drowning when the river is flooded. It is also perhaps the only river whose history can be tracked for only 500 years though the water body has been in existence since time immemorial. The river was known as `Nerva' during the Qutub Shahi regime if travel accounts by foreign historians are any indication. Later, it came to be known as Musi (named after Judeo-Christian Muslim prophet Moses ) while its tributary is named Esi (after Jesus Christ). Sadly, no documented history of the river during the period of the Kakatiyas, prior to the Qutub Shahis exist.The first recorded history of flooding of Musi dates back to 1631 CE during the reign of Abdullah Qutub Shah VII.The preceding year witnessed seve re famine in the Deccan.Syed Ali Asgar Bilgrami, who served as the officiating director of Hyderabad state archaeology department during mid-1920s, wrote in his Landmarks of the Deccan that in 1631CE “excessive rainfall flooded the city, inasmuch as the water flowed right over the Old Bridge ( Puranapul ), which led to the demolition of many lofty buildings of the city.""The Puranapul was built 14 years before the foundation of Hyderabad was laid in 1591 CE, during the reign of Ibrahim Qutb Shah IV, as Bilgrami pointed out, “chiefly with a view to affording easy egress and to avoiding the risk of life which attended the nocturnal visits of Prince Muhammad Quli to Bhagmati, a courtesan, who resided in the village of Chichlam, near Shah Ali Banda.“ French traveller Jean de Thevenot (1633-1667 CE) referred to the calmness and fury of the Musi in these words: “The River of Nerva runs under the bridge, which then seemed to be but a brook, though in time of the rains, it be as broad as the Seine before the Louvre at Paris.“ He refers to a devastating flood in Hyderabad during his visit “It began to rain and thunder.Thunder lasted not four days. Rain poured down with great storms of wind till midnight.The river overflowed so prodigiously that there was no passing over bridges, not with the help of elephants.The river of Bagnar left two thousand houses damaged in which many people perished“.The other two devastating floods were reported during late 1820s and in 1908.With modernity claiming its catchment, the Musi is no longer a river of floods.What all remains of the mighty Musi now is a municipal drain.",,Hyderabad flood of 1631,"Hyderabad, India",1631-07-01,1631-07-31,Hyderabad,100 mm,2000 houses damaged,many people perished,demolition of many lofty buildings of the city,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Today we have lost this heritage because of unchecked encroachments and ever-increasing pollution taking a heavy toll on the beautiful Hyderabad of yore.Over the decades, Hyderabadis failed to pass on the aquatic and environmental heritage left behind by the Kakatiyas, the Qutub Shahis and the Asaf Jahis to the posterity .Sadly, this generation of Hyderabadis are not fortunate to enjoy the serenity and grandeur of the environment heritage created by the ancestors.All the lakes, rivulets and the Musi, which were filled with crystal clear water once, today carry sewage and harmful wastes of all description. The city had over 2,800 lakes till 70 years ago. Some of them have been filled up with building debris for reclamation of land while others were wantonly allowed to dry up to make encroachments easier.Most of the water bodies in Hyderabad are not just aquatic structures. They are replete with history, each having its own glorious tale to tell. With the gradual death of the aquatic and environment heritage of Hyderabad, city's soil and groundwater too are polluted robbing the historic city of its once magnificent water bodies that not only quenched the thirst and provided food in the form of fish, but also served as entertainment spots for the residents.The Musi, once the lifeline of Hyderabad, is dead for all practical purposes.With encroachments coming up on its banks and in the upstream the flood flow into the river in Hyderabad has come down drastically .The river was once known for its flash floods including the mega floods of 1820 and 1908. The last grand flood the river witnessed was in September 1970 and to a lesser extent in 2015.Over 20 major reservoirs quenched the thirst of people till 50 years ago but now only two ­ Osmansagar and Himayatsagar ­ contain water that can be consumed by human beings after treat ment. The rest are unfit even after treatment.Major tanks like Ma Sahiba Tank (Masab Tank), Mir Jumla Tank, Goshamahal Tank now exist only in history books, so are hundreds of small reservoirs. The beauty of the hydrological system adopted by the erstwhile rulers was such that excess flood water from one tank overflowed into another through natural or artificial streams. These streams are either dead or have become municipal drains. The Hussainsagar built by eminent engineer Hussain Shah Wali during the Qutub Shahi period about 400 years ago once had an area of about 30 sq km. Mir Alam Tank constructed by prime minister Abul Qasim Syed Mir Alam in 1806 now contains natural and artificial reproductive hormones.The irreparable damage to the aquatic heritage of Hyderabad is frequently felt in the form of flooding of residential areas during heavy rains, shortage of drinking water and loss of fish and bird populations.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The mighty Musi has remained an integral symbol of Hyderabad, a historical city founded by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah , the fifth Sultan of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, on the southern banks of the river in 1591. The much talked about Hyderabadi culture had flourished on its banks over the centuries. Musi is also witness to some of the most significant moments in the city’s history, including the 1908 floods, which is said to have left 15,000 dead and rendered an equal number homeless.But, today Musi is well on the path of doom and degeneration, with pollution and encroachments reducing it to a filthy, stinking stream. Waking up to the reality of the river dying a slow death, thousands of Hyderabadis are expected to converge at the Gachibowli Stadium on Thursday evening as part of the ‘Rally For Rivers’ campaign. But before that, historians, environmentalists and activists take stock of the current situation of Musi:The devastating flood of Musi in 1908 was a turning point in Hyderabad. The sixth Nizam, Mahbub Ali Khan , distributed relief among the victims and took several measures to control the natural disaster in future. The seventh Nizam, Osman Ali Khan , was also eager to combat floods in Hyderabad and strengthened the bunds of Hussain Sagar as the first step. The Nizam administration consulted legendary engineer M Visvesvaraya and constructed two lakes — Gandipet and Himayatsagar — in the 1920s to divert water from Musi, a tributary of Krishna. The once perennial river, Musi was transformed to a rain-fed river, causing its degradation. Musi water was known for its purity and even medical properties. People used to collect river-bed stones from Gandipet and put them in tanks in their homes to purify water. But with no inflow, the river was on its way for doom, and you can see that happening now.— KSS Seshan, former Professor of History, University of HyderabadMusi’s pollution has reached appalling levels, and even hazardous chemicals like lead, arsenic and cadmium have been found in it. A survey revealed that children aged five or six, who reside on its banks, are experiencing premature hair greying. . The existing sewerage treatment plants are running to their optimum capacity, but are unable to treat the massive flow of effluents. The solution is to find out the pollutants at the source and segregate them. We can opt for advanced technologies like phytoremediation (a low cost, solar energy-driven cleanup technique) and bioremediation (a waste management technique that involves the use of organisms to neutralise pollutants from a contaminated site). But for all that can happen, we need a people’s movement with the participation of NGOs and local communities to force the government to revive the river! The ‘Rally For Rivers’, which activelyinvolves people in the revival process, might just be the first step. Kalpana Ramesh , lake conservationistMusi is a symbol of our heritage and without this river, the entire history of Hyderabad will fade into oblivion. Today, it is a victim of neglect and official apathy. The quality of the river water is so bad that it can no longer support aquatic life. We need to take urgent steps to revive it before it’s too late. Strict action must be initiated against those dumping chemical waste and sewage into it. We need to improve the efficiency of treatment plans so that the treated water is released back into theriver. ‘Rally For Rivers’ is a good initiative to infuse life into dying rivers and water bodies. People should put pressure on the government to conserve them, and also do their bit. Ravi Jillapalli , environmentalistFrom time immemorial, Musi has been the prime water resource for Hyderabad. But its degradation has led us to hunt for alternativewater resources. Now, over 5,000 illegal bore wells exist to meet our daily water needs. Musi’s catchment area has been encroached upon due to urbanisation and has dried up since no rain water reaches the river now. Water is life and rivers, thecradle of every human civilisation. We need to conserve every drop. The government ought to take immediate steps before Musi dries up completely. Initiatives like ‘Rally For Rivers’ will help rejuvenate rivers.—Vishala Reddy, entrepreneur and social activistWith constant dumping of garbage and effluents, Musi has turned into a filthy water body. The river also faces threat from the real estate mafia on its catchment areas as the Telangana government has recently given a go- ahead for development activities by revoking the GO 111, which bars construction activity within 10-km radius of the Osmansagar and Himayatsagar lakes. ‘Rally For Rivers’ is a first-of-its-kind endeavour that aims at unifying people for water, and is a major step in protecting our precious water resources.

The extreme El Nino conditions in 2015 and the warming trend in the Bay of Bengal contributed equally to the unprecedented heavy rainfall witnessed in Chennai for three days from November 30 to December 2, 2015, researchers have found.

El Nino generally causes less than normal rainfall in the case of the southwest monsoon. In contrast, it brings about above-normal rainfall during the northeast monsoon. This is because of the difference in seasonal wind patterns between the two monsoons.

A study by the University of Hyderabad and the Indian Institute of Technology – Bombay suggests that the extreme El Nino that occurred in 2015 played an important role in Chennai’s heavy rainfall. After 1982 and 1997, the 2015 event also turned out to be an extreme El Nino event.

“Another factor that seems to have played an important role is the consistent warming of the Bay of Bengal off the coast of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh,” says Dr. Karumuri Ashok from the Centre for Earth and Space Sciences, University of Hyderabad, and the corresponding author of the paper published in the journal Climate Dynamics .

Linear correlation

A simple linear correlation analysis carried out by the authors indicates that the Bay of Bengal sea surface temperature positively and significantly correlated with northeast monsoon rainfall.

The magnitude of correlations of northeast monsoon rainfall with El Nino conditions and the Bay of Bengal warming are nearly similar.

“Based on sensitivity experiments we could conjuncture that about 21% of the intensity of the extreme Chennai rainfall can be attributed to the extreme El Nino conditions,” Dr. Ashok says. “Interestingly, the warming trend in the Bay of Bengal [sea surface temperature] contributed equally to the Chennai event.”

El Nino can affect the Indian monsoon through atmospheric circulation. Whenever the El Nino signal shows up in atmospheric circulation, the local sea surface temperature can also change.

“Experiments suggest that changes in local sea surface temperature seem to be stronger than local atmospheric changes,” Dr. Ashok says. He however cautions that these results have been arrived using just one dynamical model. “We need to confirm if this result is correct. So we need to repeat using more cases with the same model and similar type of studies using other numerical models,” he says.

It remains to be seen if this kind of contribution from the tropical Pacific to extreme rainfall during the northeast monsoon happens only during extreme El Nino or whether normal El Ninos too can cause it.

“This is important because the El Nino itself is changing,” Dr. Ashok says.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Lakes have become urban myths in the city. Some of them exist in a shrunken form while a majority of them are just names. While the recent bouts of urban flooding have been blamed on encroachment of lakes, the fact is that some of the lakes have just disappeared.

The 1914 Leonard Munn map of Hyderabad shows exactly how many lakes in the city have disappeared. It shows Somajiguda Tank where a hospital, a supermarket, a car showroom and dozens of residential complexes exist now. In another area, it shows a massive lake called Kunta Mallaiyapalli. Today, a small water body exists on the site called Humayun Nagar Kunta. The map shows Kunta Chinna Narayana Gutta with a small hillock and a lake. The hillock with the temple exists in the area now called Chandrayangutta.

One of the bigger lakes that has disappeared without a trace is the Mir Jumla Tank. Ironically, the area is now called Talab Katta. Where once was Tigal Kunta, it is now Tigal Kunta Crossroads. Where once was Pahar Tigal Kunta is now Adams High School. Kunta Bhawani Das doesn’t exist any more. Nawab Saheb Kunta has disappeared and in its wake is a wide covered nala that sometimes overflows flooding the neighbourhood with sewerage.

The outer contours of Hussainsagar Lake show how much the lake has shrunk. If Mint Compound was on one side of the lake, the railway track ran on the other. Now, a multiplex, gardens, parks and houses exist on what used to be the lake.

Frequent floods

“The groundwater is not getting recharged. There are no gardens, no open spaces and everything is plastered and that’s why we are having these frequent floods. Hyderabad has undulating terrain with Banjara Hills and some other hill areas at a higher level and Uppal and other areas at lower level and it also has natural slopes. These natural slopes have been disturbed by urbanisation, corrupt officials and contractors,” says Shakeel Ahmed, Chief Scientist at National Geophysical Research Institute, who specialises in groundwater hydrology.

During the recent bout of flooding, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) deployed massive pumps to drain water from residential areas of Ramanthapur surrounding the Pedda Cheruvu, but to little avail. “We could see the water was being pumped out, but the water level remained the same. Only after it stopped raining did the water level begin to recede,” said a resident.

Lake restoration

Despite the frequent flooding, the encroachments are going on apace. A few days ago, Lubna Sarwath of Save Our Urban Lakes wrote to Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) to stop encroachments on Bam Ruknud Dowla lake. “It is imperative that we restore every lake and reclaim the lost water spaces to save the city from inundations and to provide it with water. There should be no compromise on restoring the heritage lake to its maximum water spread, as a drinking water source, and as a home to biodiversity, both local and migratory,” wrote Ms. Sarwath. Even Twitter messages addressed to Ministers and officials about the encroachments have gone unheeded.

“Nampally had water bodies called Afzalsagar and Mallakunta. Now, Afzalsagar is a slum area while Mallakunta is the area behind the Exhibition Ground. All the areas that had kunta/cheruvu/katta as appendage were water bodies. Most of them have disappeared due to urbanisation,” says Anant Maringanti of Hyderabad Urban Labs.

“The natural drainage system of the land has been disturbed. The chain of tanks and streams that connected them has been disrupted leading to blockages. Compounding the matter is climate change. Earlier, we had rainfall spread over a few hours. Now there is a heavy downpour for a few hours leading to flooding.

But 11 months later, it has managed to dismantle just 853 encroachments of the 3,150 that were on the demolition list. Some 2,297 structures that have narrowed down the storm water drains are still standing.

Out of 25 prime storm water drains that connect the city to the Musi, the GHMC has not cleared 14. The Balkapur and Hussainsagar surplus nala and the Banjara Hills nala have narrowed considerably, than-ks to the unchecked gro-wth of illegal buildings.

The mini floods episode of September 2016 was repeated on August 25 this year. The same areas — Bandari layout in Quthbullapur, and Dee-pthi Sree Nagar in Madinaguda — were inu-ndated because the GHMC did not carry out the work it was supposed to.

The stormwater drain running from Fox Sagar in Jeedimetla to Fatheh- nagar (chemical nala) in Quthbullapur circle has 184 obstructing structures. A GHMC survey identified an illegally constructed multi-storied vacant building at Subash Nagar, owned by Malkajgiri MP Ch. Malla Reddy, in the buffer zone of Fox Sagar.

The drain from Kapra cheruvu to Nagaram cheruvu in the Kapra circle has 220 illegal buildings. The nala from Kalaniketan to River Musi has 110 blocks, obstructing the flow of water.

The municipal authorities couldn’t remove a single structure at Banjara Hills, Yellareddyguda, Punjagutta, Yousufguda, Nagamaiahkunta, Kalasiguda, Dandu mansion, Gandhi nagar and six other localities. The excuse is that encroachers have approached the court and got a stay, or there is a stiff resistance from encroachers, or they are not willing to be shifted and rehabilitated.

Vote bank politics stalls demolitions

Local elected representatives, who object to demolishing encroachments because it means becoming unpopular with their vote banks, are the main stumbling block when it comes to anti-flooding measures.

People are reluctant to move from their illegal constructions even when given alternative housing and their elected representatives support them. Politics thus is the main culprit, stalling or delaying demolition of encroachments.

In March 2017, the GHMC planned a demolition drive on nalas under GHMC limits, but it has come to a grinding halt due to interference from local political leader from all parties.

Dr B. Janardhan Reddy, GHMC Commissioner explained, “Between 2007 and 2014, GHMC officials were able to evacuate 700 families who had encroached upon the nalas and rehabilitated them in JNNURM houses. In eight years, 700 structures were dismantled. However, the worry is why didn’t the corporation prevent these structures from being built? Once they are allowed, the inmates grow roots, earn a livelihood here and develop an emotional social environment. Later, they get a voter identification card and follow a public representative, who advocates for them. An illegal encroachment, it has to be prevented at the construction stage, since eviction is a big task.”

The GHMC’s strategy, he said, was to first identify the structure, estimate its value and provide compensation or ex-gratia from the government.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

With a road network of around 9,000 km, it has only 390 km of stormwater drains. This means more than 80 per cent of the twin cities area has no channel for rain water to drain off.

The existing stormwater drain (SWD) system is capable of handling rainfall of up to just 20 mm per hour. Since 2008, no new SWDs have been constructed even after 12 outlying municipalities were merged with the Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH).

The SWDs constructed by the gram panchayat in these municipalities have been turned into sewerage channels, due to absence of sewer network. In the peripheral belts of Kapra, Qutbullapur, Kukatpally, Uppal, and LB Nagar, clusters of new property-tax paying colonies have sprung up, that face a flood-like situation due to no storm water drain system.

After the floods of 2000, the MCH as it then was, appointed Kirloskar Consultants to draw up a comprehensive SWD master plan. The report submitted by the consultants proposed widening of 71 nalas.

However, after the formation of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), another consultant, Voyants Consultants, was appointed to inspect and propose SWD master plan for the entire GHMC area, their suggestion was clearance of bottlenecks such as, preventing garbage from accumulating in nalas and widening of 390 km of nalas.

The municipal corporation needed around Rs 1,200 crore for re-modelling the SDWs, but the entire amount never materialised and so just 54 km of SWDs was re-modelled and no new SWDs were constructed.

GHMC Municipal Commissioner Dr B. Janardhan Reddy gives a detailed explanation for the causes of flooding, but has nothing to say about why the various recommendations made over the years were not carried out.

“Flooding in various localities was found to be because of the many diversions and approximately 900 bends in nalas, which came up due to urbanisation, change of land use, and construction activities. Over the decades, builders ended up changing the earlier natural course, which needs to be restricted by making firmer laws,” he said.

He added that there was no allocation of funds to construct new SWDs. To solve the flooding problem in the most vulnerable areas of the city, the GHMC has now planned 43 works, costing Rs 2,300 crore, aimed at widening nalas for about 100 km, he said. “And in a step aimed at immediate relief, 47 works worth Rs 230 crore on bottleneck stretches in extremely vulnerable flooding areas has also been taken up,” he added.

16 storm water zones spread over the city

Storm water drains in city

Zone XII, (kukatpally), Zone XIII (Alwal) and Begumpet are areas prone to major flooding

Concern of storm water drains

Increased impervious areas in the city have led to increased run off and reduced groundwater recharge.

Irrespective of the natural drainage pattern, infrastructure development has been on the rise.

Land use planning and permissions not in tune with natural drainage patterns.

Rampant illegal encroachment on lakes.

In most countries, stormwater drains are connected with sewage drains. Dirty water is treated before it flows into lakes and rivers.

In India, though in principal stormwater drains and sewage lines are separated, but water from both drains mixes and is not treated.

The existing drainage system, covers only 30% of the city and is designed for rainfall of 12 mm/hr. The average rainfall is 23mm/hr and when it peaks it is 52 mm/hr.

In addition to the inadequate system, residents, commercial establishments and institutions use SWDs to dispose of solid waste. In fact, 25% to 30% of sewage is drained into SWDs.

Regular maintenance of de-silting and de-clogging of SWDs is not effectively undertaken.

Clogging chaos

Reduction in groundwater recharge.

Disappearance of lakes and nalas in the city, which were part of an existing sustainable stormwater management system.

Clogging of drains due to solid waste

Untreated stormwater and sewage water being drained into Musi river, Hussainsagar and other lakes has led to high pollution levels of not only water bodies but also groundwater, leading to dangerous health hazards.

After the floods of 2000, the MCH as it then was, appointed Kirloskar Consultants to draw up a comprehensive SWD master plan. The report submitted by the consultants proposed widening of 71 nalas.

In the first week of December 2015, Chennai saw unprecedented flooding as a result of heavy rainfall. Citizens banded together to rescue others stranded in their homes as the water levels rose to alarming levels. We take a look some scenes from the floods that devastated many lives and caused untold destruction to properties.

The storm brought life to a standstill and almost everyone experienced some kind of loss. Thousands were left homeless and vulnerable, at the mercy of the weather and the charity of good samaritans.

The lack of warning of the floods in Chennai made it especially difficult for people with disabilities, who were left to fend for themselves. While some needed rescuing , others lost essential implements like hearing aids, crutches and calipers, leaving them more vulnerable than ever before.

Across the city, people found pets lost on the roads . In many cases, they were washed away, or ran out when the water started rising. Many were rescued by the SPCA and the animal rescue volunteers.

Though cyclones, depressions and storms are an annual occurrence in Chennai, some years like 1985, when former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran was evacuated from his Ramapuram garden home, or 1976, when the Army stepped in to keep the Manali oil refinery running, are unforgettable.

Chembarambakkam Lake, which is blamed for the city’s flooding, was once the lifeline of South Chennai as it irrigated 168 villages in the district while the North of Chennai benefited from Puzhal Lake. However, plundering of the waterbodies, including the lake, led to the uprooting of livelihoods and homes over a vast area.

Fishermen from Kovalam and Semmanchery helped people reach Kovalam and Kelambakkam after a portion of the road connecting these two places was washed away by the floods.

The Saidapet bridge, a part of the arterial Anna Salai went under as waters rose.

In December 2015, S. Satish, an electrician by profession, sent his family, which includes two children, to a relative’s house in Egmore. He stayed back at their flood-ravaged one-storey house in Periyar Nagar, Thirunindravur (near Avadi). He hurriedly turned a small room on the terrace into a storage unit, bunging in all household items. He lived in this now-cramped room, for the rest of the house was under water.

If that was any consolation, Satish’s house was one of around 2,500 single-storey houses in Thirunindravur that were almost entirely submerged in the flood waters. However, unlike residents of most of these houses, Satish stayed put in Thirunindravur.

Even after the flood waters had receded, Thirunindravur remained a ghost town for many months. Its residents had deserted their decades-old houses and migrated to the city and also to neighbouring districts, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram, in search of safe housing. In hindsight, this seems to be an extreme and gratuitous response.

Prompt response

For, a few months after the floods, Thirunindravur began to witness changes aimed at preventing flooding in the future.

The Tiruvallur district administration, along with the Thirunindravur town panchayat, started constructing a stone-wall along the Thirunindravur lake and in the process removed encroachments, mainly houses, along the waterbody.

It was, of course, a flood-control measure. It was also a move on the part of the district administration to restore Thirunindravur residents’ trust in them, and encourage them to stay in the neighbourhood during natural calamities.

“Two years ago, we never believed that we would be able to return to our houses after the floods. Now, things have improved. Better facilities that are now available to drain excess rainwater is a relief,” says K. Marimuthu, a resident of Thirunindravur.

Improving infrastructure

Other post-flood measures taken by the administration include repairing three-feet-wide field channels that drain excess rainwater from the lake to the farmlands in the neighbourhood; and constructing wide drains to connect the lake with the Coovum river and discharge excess rainwater once the lake reaches its maximum capacity.

“The Thirunindravur tank is of immense help to farmers here. Farming in the primary occupation here,” says T.V. Ravi, former Chairman, Thirunindravur Town Panchayat. “We have to protect the lake as well as the residents from inundation. For this, the permanent solution is deepening the lake and strengthening the bund.”

Earlier, of the six sluice gates at the lake, only two were functional. The defunct sluice gates have now been repaired.

Additionally, stormwater drains on the stretches in the town have been widened and connected to the lake.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

In the last two months, more than 1,000 people have been killed in flooding events across India, southern Nepal and northern Bangladesh. Some 40 million more have seen their homes, businesses or crops destroyed.

Mumbai was especially hard hit, with water swamping offices, schools and roads and about 60 people killed — 33 alone in Thursday’s collapse of a 117-year-old apartment building whose foundation had been weakened by the flooding.

“The city was brought to its knees,” said Darryl D’Monte, a Mumbai-based environmentalist.

Residents in a neighbourhood near the Barker Reservoir return to their homes to collect belongings August 31, 2017 in Houston, Texas. The neighborhoods surrounding the reservoir are still experiencing severe flooding due to the accumulation of historic levels of rainfall, though floodwaters are beginning to recede in many parts of the city. (AFP)

Such tragedies happen almost every year in South Asia. The amount of rain Hurricane Harvey dumped on Houston over the past week was unprecedented not only for the city but also for the continental US. Mumbai, however, experienced similar flooding just 12 years ago, and several major Indian cities have been inundated since then, including Kolkata in 2007, Hyderabad in 2008, Srinagar in 2014 and Chennai in 2015.

The death toll is often high, as it is this monsoon season, because of factors that include inadequate housing. In Mumbai alone, some 3 million people are crammed into low-lying slums and have few places to flee to when floods hit.

Experts say Indian officials are doing little to reduce the risks. Instead, they allow new construction, paving over floodplains, denuding forests and testing river banks.

Mumbai authorities have ignored plans to upgrade the city’s British-era drainage system, clear drains of plastic debris and install pumping stations and flood gates to get any floodwaters out, D’Monte said.

“In most cities, lakes, ponds and even wide-open spaces acted as sponges to absorb excess rainfall. These have all disappeared from our cities and towns as water bodies are filled up and buildings come up in their place,” said Chandra Bhushan of the Centre for Science and Environment, an environment think tank in New Delhi.

“We are becoming very good at weather forecasting. But we are very poor in putting that forecast information into decisions and actions,” he said.

For north Indian farmer Avdesh Singh, predictions are of no consequence. Days ago, Singh watched as his home and fields sown with lentil crops were submerged in the village of Narayanpur Jaisingh, in state of Uttar Pradesh. He had managed to flee with the five other members of his family to a nearby highway, where they camped in the open for five days before being rescued.

“This was a dry area. We yearned for rain. But not this way,” he said. “Our world has turned topsy-turvy and there’s no going back.”

Scientists have warned that flooding events will only become more frequent, as climate change brings stronger storms and makes rainfall more erratic — a key danger for those living along both the Bay of Bengal and the Gulf of Mexico, which are considered “hurricane alleys” for the strong storms that barrel through.

Already, average temperatures across India have risen some 1.8 degrees Celsius in the last century. That extra heat increases evaporation, which makes storm clouds heavier. Higher temperatures are also increasing snow and ice melt in the Himalayas, sending more water rushing to the plains.

“Extreme rainfall events are going to be a part of our lives. If that is the case, how do we design our cities?” Bhushan said. “The current chaotic, business-as-usual urban sprawl is a recipe for disaster.”

In addition, year-round farming is clogging irrigation canals and widespread deforestation has contributed to soil erosion, reducing the ability of land to absorb water. Those were key reasons for India’s deadliest flooding of this monsoon season.

Nearly 520 people were killed last month in northern Bihar state, where silt-filled rivers couldn’t cope with this year’s high volume of water, said Dinesh Mishra, an environmentalist who has studied Bihar’s flood patterns for years. He blamed the state’s decision in the 1950s to build embankments along those rivers for tripling the area now prone to flooding.

“Instead of constructing these embankments, the government should have pushed ahead with a plan to remove the silt from the rivers,” he said.

These problems are not confined to India. Recent floods in neighbouring Nepal killed 149 people and left 27 missing, while also damaging or destroying almost a quarter of a million homes.

There, too, experts blamed deforestation and land degradation for a tragedy made worse by a lack of preparation and an institutional inability to cope.

“Some people were given some warning about the flood, but they were not told where to go in such disasters,” said geologist Shree Kamal Dwivedi with Nepal’s Department of Water Induced Disaster Management in Kathmandu.

It should be urgent now for authorities to figure out how to cope with future flooding, he said, given that “global warming and climate change is contributing to the change in rainfall patterns” and threatening to make things worse.

Many governments in India, Bangladesh and Nepal say they don’t have the money to make major changes. Still, there have been some improvements to flood preparations, including test versions of early flood warning systems and better protocols for disaster response. But experts say officials need to heed those warnings, and police and soldiers need disaster management training if they are going to continue to be deployed for rescue efforts.

In Mumbai, there is obvious room for improvement.

On Aug. 24, weather forecasters predicted heavy rain was on the way. But the warning by local authorities to close down schools and asking people to stay home came five days later.

By then, no warning was necessary. The roads were already waist-deep in water.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Chennai is no stranger to heavy rains and cyclonic storms as it is very much located along the highly volatile coast of Bay of Bengal. However, massive flooding and water logging within a span of few days of torrential rains has become almost a recurring phenomenon. Global warming, unplanned urban development and unwieldy growth with no hydrological plan are some of the reasons that have been cited as the prime reason for the threat of a massive devastation. How far is this true?

Generally, when there is heavy rain, it is the natural lakes, ponds, tanks, rivers and inter-linked drainage systems that help replenish the groundwater, hold back some water and release the excess to the ocean. And for a state like Tamil Nadu, which is not only home to about 41,127 tanks but is also characterised by a vast network of small water bodies, instances of vast areas getting inundated is indeed puzzling.

Why haven’t the major rivers such as the Cooum, Adyar and Buckhingham Canal, which serve as the main canal water drainage for the city, not able to drain out the excess of rainwater? What has happened to the Pallikaranai marsh which acts as a sponge to soak up the excess of rainwater?

Chennai’s original terrain consists of many lakes and marshy areas. The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE, 2015) reports that the city had more than 600 small water bodies in 1980s. Each of these small water bodies had a natural flood discharge channel which used to drain the spillover. But currently, only a fraction of them could be found healthy. Lamentably, they have not disappeared but have been encroached upon to make way for concrete structures.

What may have been a tank/ pond some 20 years ago is today a site of multi-storey residential or industrial structure. For instance, Chennai’s airport is built entirely on the floodplains of Adyar river; the city’s elevated railway has come up along the stretches of Buckingham Canal. While the actual number of breaches is probably much higher, in general, it has resulted in the gradual reduction in the size of some major rivers and lakes such as Cooum, Adyar, Velachery, Mogappair, Villivakkam and Ambattur.

The Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority in its draft on “Second Master Plan for Chennai Metropolitan Area, 2026” (CMDA, 2008) had clearly warned that considering its importance and drainage system it provides, contiguous swamp area in Pallikaranai should remain conserved, prohibiting development therein.

Sadly, Pallikaranai marshland over the years has become the largest dumping site for solid waste. Open spaces and drainage courses have all become the centre of human habitation. In such a case, where will the rain water runoff go? Pathetically, it has to settle instead on the roads causing extensive flood.

The threat of a catastrophic flooding and encroachments on ecologically sensitive wetlands is not happening in Chennai alone. Recent floods in Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Guwahati, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Surat clearly demonstrated how most of the urban centres of India fail to manage their drainage channels.

In the process of building a smart city, most of the major cities in India have either completely neglected or have encroached upon the natural reservoirs indiscriminately. As the planet continues to get warmer in the coming decades, countries like India is expected to get more rainfall in less number of rainy days. Are we prepared for it?

As torrential rain continues to batter Chennai, massive water logging in most of the areas clearly indicates that the city has not learned any lessons from 2015. Natural disasters cannot be prevented, but we cannot also sit and wait till the nature unleashes its excess. Better planning is the least that can be done.

A constructive urban planning with proper drainage system is the need of the hour. Governments should not compromise in taking stringent action against encroachments on natural reservoirs, which is reducing water storage capacity.

Tamil Nadu is one among the few states spending large sums of money to clean the rivers and resuscitate the sewage infrastructure. However, all its efforts went in vain primarily because of the civic authorities and land mafia who have been seriously engaged in violating the hydrological cycle of the city. The Standing Committee on Water Resources (2012-13) on “Repair, Renovation and Restoration of Water Bodies”, in its 16th report underlined that most of the water bodies in the country were encroached upon by municipalities and panchayats.

A new legislation should be urgently enacted to make encroachments on water bodies a cognizable offense. In its landmark judgement recently, the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court directed the Government not to grant layout or building plan permission on lands located on water bodies. This is indeed an encouraging signal towards the restoration of dying small water bodies and reducing flood.

With the launch of the massive ‘kudimaramathu’ scheme across the state recently, the policymakers have now realised that the key to resolving both the issues of water shortage and flooding lies in repairing, restoration and renovation of small water bodies which have been largely encroached. Tamil Nadu state can also think of establishing a dedicated Ministry for Water Resources and Flood Governance to improve its governance on water resources and flood on a regular basis.

It is imperative to impose a blanket ban on all construction works in the marshlands. Given the needs, developmental activities in urban areas should be strictly reviewed and approved. Desilting of small water bodies and drainages should be undertaken in regular intervals. The rain water harvesting method that was propagated some years back in the state needs a fresh thrust.

Parks must have ponds and large development areas must have at least a two-acre retention area which will in turn recharge the aquifers. Wherever possible, interlinking of rivers within the state should be encouraged so that the excess of water rather than going waste can be diverted to the water-deficit regions. These initiatives need to be undertaken on a war-footing level. Or else the flood related problems will become a recurring phenomenon.

On the one hand, it was said to have provided connectivity to the city on the south to the north. And on the other, it was fabled that a king constructed it so that a young prince could meet his beloved. The Purana Pul , one of the oldest surviving bridges of Qutb Shahi dynasty , and its legacy of love, is now all but lost, with it crying for attention.Given the fact that it holds significance as one of the oldest bridges of the city and the legend associated with it, it is strange the recent Telangana Heritage (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Maintenance) Act 2017 has not listed it in the ‘Post Kakatiya Protected Monuments’ category.The department of archaeology and museums does not have Purana Pul on its list of 27 protected structures in the city. While it was listed as the 11th structure on HMDA ’s list of protected heritage monuments, Regulation 13 has since been scrapped.To resuscitate its lost glory as an iconic landmark, former tourism department director G Kishan Rao embarked on a plan in 2002. “It is believed Ibrahim Qutb Shah built this bridge for his son Mohammed Qutb Shah so that he could meet his beloved Bhagmati. This legend may be contested, but the effort to revive the Purana Pul by calling it ‘Pyarana Pul’ by Kishan Rao and to subsequently make it a beacon of Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb was the last time when an important step was taken to revive the bridge,” said a heritage expert.The bridge has now become an open space for hawkers and all vehicular movement is barred. And below, runs the toxic waters of Musi. There is indiscriminate dumping of waste. Pigs and other animals are also seen wallowing in the dirt. One can also see vegetation grown on parts of the bridge. It is about time that this is cleared.“In the 1908 tughyani, Naya Pul was washed away but Purana Pul withstood the vicious floods. Moreover, it was constructed so that the deployment of Qutb Shahi forces from south to the north over the Musi could take place. The army could not wait for low tide for it to cross,” heritage expert Sajjad Shahid said, even as he maintained that Mohammed Quli and Bhagmati tale is ‘beautiful’ and is worth keeping alive, but it was built for more practical requirements. He opined that by virtue of its unique features, it should be included in the protected list.Conservation architect GSV Suryanarayana Murthy said plans for its conservation were submitted once in 2006 and later, between 2011 and 2013.

Things are looking up for sixty-two-year-old S. Rathnam, a marginal farmer in Poonamallee.

Around the same time two years ago, he was grief-stricken. For, the paddy crops on his three-hectare farm were washed away in the floods.

Now, on the same parcel of land, he grows paddy, groundnut, greens, brinjal and tomatoes. More significantly, over the last two years, he has been gradually making up for the loss he incurred due to the floods. Now, he plants crops three seasons in a year.

There are reasons to believe that Rathnam’s new-found happiness will continue, and the locality will not witness flooding of the scale it experienced in 2015.

Poonamallee Municipality has taken many steps to prevent such a situation. They include widening stormwater drains, bitumen-topping most of the 186 roads within its limits and clearing blockages and encroachments in channels carrying rainwater to waterbodies.

Most of the narrow stormwater drains had either been damaged or were blocked due to dumping of garbage. Some drains had disappeared as a result of encroachment.

“One of the lessons from the 2015 floods is that we have to keep water channels free of encroachments,” says an official of Poonamallee Municipality.

It may be noted that Poonamallee is surrounded by many waterbodies, including Porur, Mangadu and Chembarabakkam lakes.

Detailed study

To clear blockages in stormwater channels and water channels, the map of Poonamallee was re-designed after a detailed study of its topography. Old stormwater drains and water channels in the locality that constitute a water-carrying mechanism linked to waterbodies, were identified. With funds from the Commissionarate of Municipal Administration, work on widening stormwater drains and restoration of water channels were taken up last year.

Initially, this work was taken up on major link roads in Poonamallee. As per norms, regular stormwater drains are around three feet wide and five feet deep. After the 2015 floods, the width of the new stormwater drains was increased to 5.5 feet from 3 feet to accommodate surplus rainwater. Simultaneously, water channels passing through the neighbourhood and taking the surplus water from Chembarabakkam lake to Cooum river, were cleared of water hyacinths and garbage.

Small waterbodies within the neighbourhood like ponds and temple tanks were deepened. New stormwater drains are also being built on lanes to connect them to small waterbodies in the locality. Most of the flood-related projects have been completed.",solution,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city and suburbs,"1,044 mm","Rs. 10,000 crore",500,10 lakh people were displaced,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage, and encroachment of waterbodies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

FLOODS IN RAJASTHAN: IS IT NORMAL?

This year’s intense flooding in the desert state of Rajasthan has led to an obvious question: Is climate change the culprit?

“While there is evidence that climate change is causing disruptions in rainfall patterns, there is nothing unusual in the current spell of rains as similar rains had happened in the past,” explained PG Dhar Chakrabarti, former executive director, National Institute of Disaster Management.

This is because ---- and many people don’t realise this ---- flooding is not just about rainfall. Flooding is rainfall+. “The rainfall+ factors include: Sudden release of large quantities of water from dams/ water reservoirs; breach/damage in major reservoirs/ dams; limited holding capacity and urbanisation,” added Dhar Chakrabarti.

The problem is that these factors are not considered for flood risk mapping, which still remains an unaccomplished task of disaster risk management experts in India.

Even the Vulnerability Atlas of India has stopped short of doing flood zonation. A task force set up by the Central Water Commission (CWC) in 2006 did not complete the task and recently an expert body has been constituted to collect data for flood risk mapping at settlement level. But thus may take time before this work is completed.

According to a report in Scroll.in, the reason behind this year’s heavy rains is this: An unusual formation of the monsoon trough, an area of low pressure, has generated intense rainfall. Low-pressure regions develop frequently over the Bay of Bengal and move West or North West, drawing rain to the northern regions of the country. This year, the pattern has been different, with two separate depressions present at the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal at the same time.

CAN WE MINIMISE FLOOD DESTRUCTION?

Flood-related destruction can only be minimised only if flood forecasting is accurate.

Unfortunately, like flood risk mapping, India fails miserably on this score too.

The Comptroller and Auditor General’s recent report said a majority of India’s flood forecast systems have either been washed away or their parts have been stolen. “Nearly 60% of the 375 telemetry stations set up between 1997 and 2016 are non-operational which defeats the purpose of investing in the modernisation of flood forecast network.

The issue of investing in better flood forecasting policy has also been raised in water policy expert and former plan panel member Mihir Shah’s report to the government on “A 21st Century Institutional Architecture for India’s Water Reforms”.

“In addressing the problem of floods, the central focus over the years has been on engineering/structural solutions. Apart from the massive investments in large dams, India has already constructed over 35,000 km of embankments. But these are rapidly reaching their limits... Instead, [India needs better weather and flood forecasting is required, along with flood insurance and possibly the designation of flood diversion areas...”.

It goes on to add that the existing flood forecasting network of the CWC is not sufficient to cover the country adequately and that there is an urgent need for the extension of the organisation’s flood forecasting network in consultation with states and India Meteorological Department to cover non-metros.

“The lead-time for flood forecasting can be improved through the use of hydraulic and hydrologic models which are linked to the weather forecasting system, the real time data acquisition system, and the reservoir operation system. It’s possible to improve the current forecasting methods by using satellite-based information for better estimates of rainfall and snowmelt,” it adds.

Experts also point out that Bangladesh has better forecasting capabilities than India. Its Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre website gives a good idea about the rivers and the forecasting sites. The home page also provides information on the sites where water level is currently on the rise or above the danger mark.

The choice for India is obvious but snail’s pace progress in setting up these critical forecasting systems is only leaving the administration at the local level without any advance warning to prepare for the surge of the rivers.

“The river was swollen the morning after the earthquake, which seemed to last for an eternity. We saw fallen trees in it, people and animals flailing, dead bodies of people and animals that were carried on the strong current.”

Krishna Chawla (née Das) was 13 when a strong earthquake that lasted about eight minutes jolted Assam and adjacent areas on the evening of August 15, 1950.

The Brahmaputra River, which was always “eating away at parts of the state,” looked terrifying, she recollects. “All of us students went to help build embankments the next day, and while I was passing a bag full of sand to a fellow student, I saw the river take away the house I was born in. The house collapsed, and I stood there paralysed,” said Ms. Chawla, the daughter of a forest officer in Dibrugarh.

The massive earthquake that ravaged Assam on Independence Day that year not only claimed over 1,000 lives, but also changed the course of the mighty Brahmaputra. The riverbed rose as the mountains shook, and what had been a stable course became a constantly shifting one eroding the banks.

This especially increased the amount of silt carried by the river and its tributaries. The silt was deposited on the banks downstream, and on the riverbed. Due to this heavy deposition, the river ""frequently changes its course with the main channel flowing into multiple channels"" hitting the river bank causing further erosion, a study published in 2014 by the Civil Engineering Department, Royal Group of Institutions explains.

The riverbed area of the Brahmaputra has increased by more than 50 per cent through erosion since the quake. According to a report on climate change published by the government of Assam in September 2015, erosion has destroyed more than 3,800 square kilometres of farmland, which is nearly half the size of Sikkim, since 1954. Due to erosion, the riverbed area has expanded from around 3,870 sq.km. estimated between 1916 and 1928 to 6,080 sq.km. in 2006. Based on the civil engineering report, between 1954 and 2008 about 4,27,000 hectares has been eroded at the rate of 8,000 hectares per year.

The human cost

Lalita Biswas, 30, a daily wage earner at a brick factory in Morigaon, Assam, had to leave her submerged house in a village in Morigaon in a boat provided by villagers and take shelter in an open space on a nearby hillock. She was living in a polythene tent with her husband, who also works at the brick factory, and children. Her children have suffered from colds and fevers, and her family did not receive any help from the government, she said.

“We’re always neglected because we are poor,” she said when asked if she had received any help from the state authorities. Ms. Biswas wasn’t alone. About 100 people climbed the hills to escape the flood and have to rebuild their houses and lives.

A similar story was told by Nishikant Deka, 80, of Gorubandha, a village about 40 km from Guwahati. He and his 12-member family had to evacuate their house in neck-deep water and take shelter at a naamghar (public prayer hall). They managed to carry some rice, and food provided once in a while by NGOs kept them going. The head of the house described how almost every year the family has to reconstruct the bamboo home that floodwaters destroy.

The government of Assam estimates that 2,753 human lives have been lost along with 6,73,329 cattle and the total losses due to floods and erosion amount to nearly ₹4659.472 crore. Flooding this year took the lives of 157 people and destroyed hundreds of acres of land. According to the state disaster management authorities, in the past five years, flooding has killed about 500 people.

Controlling the floods

One of the main methods used in the State to control floods is embankments, but almost every year the Brahmaputra and the Barak breach their banks, inundating agricultural land and houses. “The most recent embankments are 25 years old,” says Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People. “Checking embankments before monsoon should be done as we never know where it will be breached. When the flow is extreme, erosion capacity is greater,” he adds.

In August this year, the State government announced that as many as five dredgers will be used to deepen the Brahmaputra, and the harvested silt will be used to construct the 725-km Brahmaputra Expressway along both banks of the river. In an earlier report , the Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal told The Hindu : “We believe it will not only improve the water-carrying capacity of the Brahmaputra, but also make the river navigable for bigger cargo ships. That used to be the case before Independence.”

Sanjoy Hazarika, director of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative is unconvinced. He is for an engineering assessment, along with environment assessment, as dredging “might change the course of river.” Mr. Thakkar adds that the way dredging is done followed by the construction of highway on both banks will determine the changes the river will see.

The Brahmaputra Board, under the Ministry of Water Resources, had suggested constructing dams in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh about 30 years ago, the Subansiri project being one of them. Subansiri was initially designed as a hydro-power and storage dam, which the board believed would help reduce the impact of floods. However, it was later transformed into just a hydroelectric project aimed at generating 2000 megawatts of electricity, which invited opposition from local people and environment scientists.

There is the possibility that hydro electric projects can worsen the situation. “Ranganadi project is a classic example of damage caused by the dam in downstream,” Mr. Thakkar points out. The dam in Arunachal Pradesh -- part of a hydro-electric project -- is on the Ranganadi tributary of Brahmaputra. During winter the river barely exists, but during monsoon it swells up, inundating villages. The All Assam Students' Union in July this year demanded demolition of the Ranganadi hydro project, alleging that release of water by the North Eastern Electric Power Corp. on July 11 without prior notice affected hundreds of thousands of people in Lakhimpur and Majuli, media reported.

The permanent destruction of wetlands in the State has also been contributing to the deluge. Assam is home to more than 3,000 wetlands and many varieties of flora and fauna. “Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts of the state,” said Dulal Chandra Goswami, former head of department of environmental science at Guwahati University.

“Wetlands play a very significant role as natural reservoirs of water that absorb part of the flood waters from the nearby rivers through their connected channels and also from surface runoff,"" Mr. Goswami explains. Most of these wetlands are in derelict condition mainly due to human-induced factors such as encroachment for agriculture or infrastructure development.

“To mitigate floods, any potential practical solution should be based on an integrated, multidisciplinary basin management plan focused on water and soil conservation together with geo-environmental, eco-biological and socio-cultural integrity of the basin,” Mr. Goswami says. “The basin management approach is essential in view of the interstate as well as international character of most of the tributaries and the mainstream.”

Effects of Climate Change

Compounding the issue of an unpredictable Brahmaputra, are the effects of climate change. “Climate change will result in more frequent and severe floods, which will increase the costs of reconstruction and maintenance on state infrastructure, including roads, irrigation, water and sanitation,” says the report on climate change published by the Assam government.

According to the study, by 2050, the average annual runoff of the river Brahmaputra will decline by 14 per cent. However, there is a risk of glaciers melting, leading to flash floods.

As the economy of Assam is largely dependent on natural resources, what happens with agriculture and forests has direct effects on the livelihood of its people. During floods, water becomes contaminated, and climate change has a direct impact on the water resources sector by increasing the scarcity of freshwater, which is a constant problem in summer.

“The predicted increase in average temperature and decrease in the number of rainy days due to climate change will further stress water resources,” the report points out.

The study goes on to say that heavier rainfall replacing continuous low or normal rainfall during monsoon might lead to flash floods in low-lying areas. This will also reduce the groundwater recharge.

Change in approach

While the present approach towards flood has been immediate relief, much more need to be done before torrential rains hit the State during monsoon. The short-term measures on which flood management in the State presently depends, such as rebuilding the breached embankments, are largely inadequate.

Besides, more accurate and decentralised forecasts of rain can help in improving preparedness. “Weather reports should be made available on district level and should be accessible to public,” says Mr. Thakkar of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People. “Information should be available in local languages. With the forecast in, one can calculate how much more water will flow downstream, thereby alerting people in advance to evacuate. The nature of rivers is such that there is no way one can flood-proof whole of Assam so one has to keep it mind that floods will happen.”

He adds that the water flow information shared by China on the Brahmaputra with India, for which India pays a certain amount, should also be shared with the public, as this will help in understanding the river better and therefore help people better prepare for floods.

As the research scholars point out, studying the river and the impact of climate change is a must to understand why the state gets flooded every year. As line in a famous Assamese song goes: “ Luitar parore ami deka lora; moribole bhoi nai (We are the youths from the banks of the Luit [Brahmaputra]; we are not afraid of death),” people in the Valley seems to be living by the same spirit.",issue,Assam Floods,"Assam, India",1950-08-15,Present,Assam,"8,000 hectares per year","2,753 human lives have been lost along with 6,73,329 cattle and the total losses due to floods and erosion amount to nearly ₹4659.472 crore",157,"flooding this year took the lives of 157 people and destroyed hundreds of acres of land.

Life had come to a standstill in the Ganga-Brahmaputra floodplains where large tracts of land were reeling under floods. Everywhere there were submerged houses, broken bridges, and wasted railway tracks. The fury of the waters in the Kishanganj and Katihar districts of Bihar had cut off the road and rail services in north Bengal, and consequently Northeast India’s connectivity by rail with the rest of India. On such occassions, schools routinely turn into relief centres and schoolchildren are forced to take a “flood vacation”. Access to water and sanitation is difficult. Open defecation is common, and the use of contaminated water leads to a peak in water-borne diseases. Agricultural land is either covered with sand or remains waterlogged.

No ‘safe’ area in the floodplains

Further accentuating the misery is the failure of embankments — the gold standard for flood protection. An embankment is an uplifted earthen structure constructed along the river channel to artificially reduce the size of the floodplains by constricting floodwaters to a narrow stretch. The land outside the embankment is supposed to be safe from floods. However, embankment breach resulting in flooding the “safe” areas is routine. We need a paradigm shift in the way these embankments are managed. It is important to involve the community that is close to the embankment in its management. Only then can we break the build-and-forget mentality that currently rules the bureaucracy.

Our study of over 100 villages in the Ganga-Brahmaputra floodplains found that villages in these areas are exposed to diverse water-related hazards depending on their location vis-a-vis an embankment. Those located inside the embankment are vulnerable to floods and riverbank erosion, and those outside, in the “safe” areas, are prone to extended periods of inundation. This takes place when the construction of an embankment causes the drainage lines to be blocked, the regulators in the embankments become dysfunctional, or when there is a backflow of the larger river in spate. The people in these “safe” areas suffer from a perennial fear of embankment breach, which is not entirely unfounded. In Bihar in 2008, there was a colossal embankment breach in the Kosi river basin. This year too, in parts of Assam, Bihar and West Bengal breaches have caused flooding. Only in a few cases have newly constructed embankments been able to protect villages located outside them from floods. Despite this, in flood-prone areas with no embankments, people still articulate the need for embankments.

Till now, embankments have been managed by irrigation or flood-control departments. However, the communities near the embankments are best positioned to take care of them. The responsibility of embankment management could be devolved to the community, while the ownership right resides with the state. But this task of decentralisation will not be easy when society is fractured along the lines of caste, class, and religion. We must remember then that disaster is non-discriminatory and affects all.

To incentivise collective action from the community, the state has to create an enabling institutional environment. The community-based organisations (embankment management committees) should be empowered to earn revenue from the embankments through levying tolls (as most embankments are also used as roads), and undertake plantation activities (and sale of the harvest). In areas where villages exist both inside and outside the embankment, their interests conflict. In such cases, efforts could be made to ensure that the former has a greater share of the revenue. This will dissuade them from causing a breach. While the irrigation or flood-control departments might issue tenders for periodic maintenance activity, the committees could act as a partner to partly implement the same, or act as a monitoring agency. Payment to contractors could be conditioned upon a joint inspection by the irrigation department and the embankment management committees.

Promoting decentralised management systems is yet to be tested for embankment management, even as participatory irrigation and joint forest management are established practices. But if the past teaches us something, it is that build-and-forget cannot be an option for embankments. If we have to shift from reactive flood protection to year-round flood governance, we must design ways of embankment management in flood-prone areas. Participatory embankment management could be the way forward.

As erratic weather events become more common with climate change, India urgently needs to formulate a national flood management policy

Update (14/8/2017): India’s meteorological department forecast a normal monsoon in 2017, but excess rain over short periods has flooded some of the country’s driest regions (like Rajasthan and Gujarat) this year. Most recently, eastern states of Assam and Bihar have been hit by fresh floods and army has been called for help. In Assam, 21 of the 22 districts have been affected. Some 80 per cent of the Kaziranga National Park, home to India’s one-horned rhinos, has been flooded. Four districts in Bihar have been flooded as Tapti and Mahanadi rivers swell. Floods are a regular in India. But there is something peculiar about them this year: they not only came early, but have stayed longer. And worryingly, they have not been proportionate to the rainfall. Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan were in a drought-like situation when floods occurred in July-August, while Bihar and Assam—two states that are facing their worst floods in almost three decades—have had deficit rainfall this monsoon. These patterns seemed to have escaped attention.



Nobody took notice when floods hit Assam this April. A new government was just sworn in and the media did not pay much heed to the unusually high pre-monsoon rain. Everyone thought the rising waters of the Burhidehing and Desang rivers would subside. It did not happen. The flood continued till the end of August, covering more than 90 per cent of the state and affecting over four million people.



“The pre-monsoon rainfall this year has been very strong, both in terms of the absolute rainfall and its geographical coverage,” says D C Goswami, former head of the Department of Environmental Science, Guwahati University. According to the National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad, heavy rains in the fourth week of April caused the first “wave” of floods in Assam. On April 25, the Burhidehing and Desang crossed the danger mark and caused floods in six districts—Dibrugarh, Sivasagar, Jorhat, Tinsukia, Cachar and Charaideo. Experts say the heavy pre-monsoon showers have provided the clinching evidence of the increasing frequency of western disturbances that bring the rain. According to the Regional Meteorological Centre, Guwahati, rainfall in the state was 21 per cent above normal in March-April.



What is frightening is the fact that such unusual rain will become more common with climate change. “It is the pre-monsoon showers, rather than the monsoon, which will increase because of global warming,” says Subashisa Dutta, professor at the Department of Civil Engineering, IIT-Guwahati. In 2012, Dutta studied the impact of climate change on the hazard of floods in the middle Brahmaputra reaches and found that the peak discharges from the river, the average duration of a flood wave and the intensity of pre-monsoon showers are likely to rise during 2071-2100.



It is quite ironic that Assam witnessed floods when its total monsoon rainfall between June 1 and August 16 was 25 per cent below normal. So, what caused the flood? Data suggests that most floods were preceded by extreme rainfall events (see ‘Under water’).



The India Meteorological Department (IMD) divides extreme rainfall events into two categories: rainfall of 124.5-244.4 mm in 24 hours is “very heavy” and rainfall more than that is “extremely heavy”. In July alone Assam recorded six “very heavy” rainfall days. By July 25, the Central Water Commission (CWC) had declared moderate floods in three districts of the state where the Beki, Sankosh and Brahmaputra rivers were flowing above the danger mark.



Arup Kumar Sarma, professor at the Department of Civil Engineering, IIT-Guwahati, says the floods this year were unusual in another way: they seem to have caused more damage. “This is because the direction of the storm and the direction of flow of the river was the same. In such a situation, rains directly contribute to the rise in water levels,” he explains.



However, there is not enough long-term data to claim that extreme rainfall events have increased over the years. For instance, in Assam, no significant trends in 24-hour rain were observed between 1951 and 2010, says the state’s action plan on climate change. The report, however, states that extreme rainfall events in Assam may increase by 5-38 per cent and incidences of floods by 25 per cent during 2021-2050.

THE SPREAD: some of the states were facing drought before they witnessed floods this year

Apart from Assam, floods impacted nearly five million people in 19 states by the third week of August. Most of these were triggered by the first monsoon showers. Remarkably, just before the floods, some of the states were hit by drought. In Madhya Pradesh, floods came after a drought in April-May. Until June 8, the monsoon had hardly covered the state and IMD had forecast severe to very severe heat wave in some parts. But on July 12, the 24-hour rainfall in Burhanpur and Betul districts was an astonishing 1,135 per cent and 1,235 per cent above normal respectively. By July 18, more than 35 lives were lost and nine people went missing as 23 districts in the state faced flood-like situation. Again, on August 20-21, Bihar’s 12 districts witnessed extreme rain events. In Sagar, the Khurai meteorological station recorded 187.2 mm rainfall on August 20. Ken and Tamsa rivers were flowing above the danger mark due to heavy rains in Panna and Rewa districts. The total death toll in the state due to rain-related accidents from the beginning of the monsoon season to August 22 stood at 102.



Similar was the case with Bihar where the cumulative rainfall between June 1 and August 22 was 15 per cent below normal. However, 3.8 million people in 23 districts, including Patna, were facing floods by August 21. The Ganga was flowing above the danger mark in Buxar, Munger, Khagaria, Siwan and Katihar. Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said silt deposition in the river after the construction of Farraka barrage in West Bengal caused the rise in water levels.



However, D K Mishra, convener of Bihar-based non-profit Barh Mukti Abhiyan, says, “Since 2007, the cumulative seasonal rainfall in the state has been abnormally low and the flood this year was caused by heavy precipitation in Nepal” (see ‘Floods no longer a rural problem’ on p29). Regardless, the state did see extreme rainfall event on 11 days in June-July. On July 31, the Madhwapur meteorological station recorded 200 mm rain.



In the adjacent state of Uttar Pradesh too, the Ganga was flowing above the danger mark in Mirzapur, Ballia and Varanasi districts while parts of Allahabad were inundated on August 21.



In Rajasthan, conditions were under control till July. “In August, the intensity of rainfall shot up like never before,” says Y P Mathur, professor at the Department of Civil Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur. On August 11, the rainfall in nearly half of the districts was more than 100 per cent above normal. Pali and Sikar districts received a phenomenal 1,059 per cent and 1,100 per cent above normal rain. According to local newspapers, rainfall in Jodhpur was the heaviest in the past 90 years. The gates of the Bilaspur dam had to be opened to drain water into the Banas river to prevent flood in Tonk district. Extreme rainfall events were again recorded in 16 meteorological stations of the state on August 20-21. According to Rajasthan’s draft action plan on climate change, published in 2010, the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events in the state is likely to increase by 20 mm a day during 2017-2100.



Uttarakhand faced floods on May 28 itself, when a cloudburst hit Tehri district. Two people were killed in the flood that followed and nearly 400 houses were reported to have been damaged till June 4. By July 25, flood had occurred in 13 districts and 49 lives were lost.



Scientific studies point out that while monsoon rain is decreasing in India, extreme rainfall events are increasing, particularly in July-August. A paper published in Nature Climate Change in 2014 states that the intensity of extremely wet spells and extremely dry spells during the South Asian monsoon season have been increasing since 1980. “We are looking at rainfall extremes that only occur at most a few times a year, but can have very large impact,” says Noah Diffenbaugh, senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, under whom the study was conducted. The team compared data collected by IMD and other sources over the past 60 years for July and August. It found that the average rainfall over Central India has reduced from 10 mm a day to about 9 mm a day. However, the day-to-day variability in rainfall in these months has increased, leading to periods of heavy rainfall or prolonged dry spells.

FINANCIAL DRAIN: floods cost the country Rs 8,12,500 crore between 1953 and 2011 Apart from causing loss of life, floods are a huge financial drain. They are the biggest threat to agriculture, impacting 7.5 million hectares (ha) of farmland every year, particularly in agrarian states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Assam. In Assam, close to 0.1 million people move to relief centres every year. Same is the case with Bihar, where thousands spend four to five months in camps. According to an analysis by Down To Earth, state governments of Assam and Bihar are officially involved in flood relief and rehabilitation works for seven months every year. And it is likely to get worse. Data shows that flood-affected areas in the country have increased by 162 per cent since 1960 (see ‘Uncontrolled surge’). The average annual flood damage has also increased by over 160 per cent—from R1,805 crore a year during 1947-1995 to R4,745 crore a year during 1996-2005, according to the National Disaster Management Authority. Though there are no recent estimates, it would not be wrong to assume that with growing urbanisation, the damage would have only gone up in the past decade.



According to a working group on flood management, set up by the erstwhile Planning Commission in 2011, R1,26,000 crore have been spent on flood control in the country since 1953 and the economic loss caused by floods has been R8,12,500 crore at 2011 prices.



The working group said that this cost would go up by 10 per cent every year. This means that in 2015, the total cost would have been R11,46,940 crore, or 7.6 per cent of India’s estimated GDP for 2016-17. To make matters worse, the states do not take the problem seriously since the Constitution does not mention flood management under either the Union, State or Concurrent lists. “States give damage estimates only to avail relief packages from the Centre,” says a CWC official, requesting anonymity. During the tenure of the working group only Bihar, Assam, Rajasthan and Kerala took part in the deliberations. Of these, two states did not attend the deliberations after the first meeting. Even five years after the Planning Commission gave its estimates on the total flood damage in the country, the states have not confirmed or denied their accuracy. After 40 years Experts differ on the relevance of the recommendations made by Rashtriya Barh Ayog in 1976 in today's time KAMTA PRASAD

MEMBER, RASHTRIYA BARH AYOG



Recommendations of the Rashtriya Barh Ayog (RBA) were quite comprehensive and received praise. Even the erstwhile Planning Commission's working groups on flood management acknowledged this. But, sadly, these have not been implemented even 40 years after they were made. There is a lack of political will to implement them, engineers are reluctant to modify their methods and the bureaucracy is not prepared to involve communities. RBA had also suggested short/medium-term measures, such as construction of embankments, and long-term strategy, such as training communities in disaster risk reduction. But the government has only focused on building embankments. That is the problem.”



R RANGACHARI

CHAIRPERSON OF THE COMMITTEE TO REVIEW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF RASHTRIYA BARH AYOG RECOMMENDATIONS



We found that states were not sincere in the implementation of Rashtriya Barh Ayog recommendations. They cited inter-state issues and lack of funds, but wasted money on unplanned relief and rehabilitation works. There was hardly a law against encroachment on the floodplains, and where laws did exist, they were not enforced because politicians had a stake in developmental works on the floodplains. States need to understand that rivers have no political/geographical boundaries. The Centre needs to play a more proactive role in flood control. Long-term planning, as opposed to short-term solutions, is key.

While there is no denying that the Rashtriya Barh Ayog report was an excellent assessment of the flood situation in India, some of its recommendations are not applicable today. For instance, floodplain zoning caught the fancy of policymakers in the 1980s primarily because of its popularity in the US. But flood-prone areas have increased substantially since then and moving people out of these zones is not feasible. Flood is a complex problem that requires the attention of a number of departments at the state and national level. At the same time, we need to learn to live with floods and develop the coping capabilities of communities.”

STATUS QUO: India's flood management capacity has remained unchanged for 40 years Even 40 years after India’s first and last commission on floods was constituted, the situation has not improved. There is no national-level flood control authority in the country. Rashtriya Barh Ayog (National Flood Commission or RBA) was set up by the then Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation in 1976 to study India’s flood control measures after the projects launched under the National Flood Control Programme of 1954 failed to achieve much success. In 1980, RBA made 207 recommendations and four broad observations. First, it said that there was no increase in rainfall in India and, thus, the increase in floods was due to anthropogenic factors like deforestation, drainage congestion and badly planned development works. Second, it questioned the effectiveness of the methods adopted to control floods, for instance, embankments and reservoirs, and suggested that the construction of these structures be halted till their efficacy was assessed. However, it did say that embankments could be constructed in areas where they were effective. Third, it said that there has to be consolidated efforts among the states and the Centre to take up research and policy initiative to control floods. Fourth, it recommended a dynamic strategy to cope with the changing nature of floods.



An analysis of the report suggests that the problem begins with the methods of estimating the flood-prone area of the country (see ‘Uncontrolled surge’). An accurate estimate is crucial for framing flood management programmes. RBA estimated that the total area vulnerable to floods in 1980 was around 40 million hectares. The figure was reached by calculating the maximum area affected by floods in all the states in any one of the years between 1953 and 1979, and adding to it the area where flood protection works had been undertaken. The areas where protection works failed were then subtracted from this total.



However, this is a flawed methodology and RBA itself acknowledges this fact. “It is clear that while the maximum area flooded in any one year may broadly indicate the degree of the flood problem in a state, it does not strictly indicate the area ‘liable’ to floods as different areas may be flooded in different years,” states the report.



There is another problem. The very definition of flood-prone area does not reflect the effectiveness of the flood management works undertaken, wrote G S Purba, former chief engineer at CWC, in a paper presented at the Indian Disaster Management Congress in 2006. “One reason for this could be that we are still unsure of the performance of flood management measures,” says V D Roy, member, CWC.



Despite its flaws, the method continues to be used. “We have begun collecting data for a more scientific assessment—one that relies on frequency-based climate modelling— but adopting it in full force will take time,” says Roy. In a 2011 meeting of the working group on flood management for the 12th Five Year Plan, C Lal, Director of Flood Management Programme, CWC, acknowledged that scientific criteria need to be adopted to assess flood-prone areas. This should be based on frequency of flooding and period of inundation as gauged by contour maps and satellite imagery, he suggested.



The RBA report also recognised the need for timely evaluation of flood management projects. It entrusted state irrigation and flood control departments, CWC, Ganga Flood Control Commission and the Brahmaputra Board with the task of adopting or discarding them on the basis of their performance. But this has not been the case. “In 2001, we found that state governments had hardly done any assessments of flood control projects,” says R Rangachari, chairperson of the committee and former CWC member.



Even when flood management projects are evaluated, the reports are not credible. “Most post project evaluations that we laid our hands on did not have enough data,” says Rangachari. Moreover, the evaluation is generally done by departments that undertake flood-control projects. “I haven’t come across any third-party evaluation of flood management projects in Assam,” says Goswami.



A major problem is the inaction on recommendations of evaluation reports. For instance, in 1978, RBA asked the Programme Evaluation Organisation of the Planning Commission to review the Kosi embankments. The study, published in 1979, concluded that embankments had, in fact, enhanced the flood problem. But still the embankments were raised by 2 m in 1987-88.



Another key recommendation of the report was that state governments should legislate on floodplain management, particularly encroachment and floodplain zoning (demarcating a floodplain into zones and specifying the level of development allowed in each). But apart from Rajasthan and Manipur, no state has enacted laws on floodplain zoning. Same is the case with legislations on encroachment. Only Bihar, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have laws against encroachment of floodplains. Even Assam, a state that gets flooded almost every alternate year, does not have specific laws against floodplain encroachment. State governments argue that such laws would hinder development.



The RBA report also said that state governments must focus on maintenance of completed works rather than constructing new structures. In Assam, for instance, over 4,470 km of embankments were constructed till the 1970s, says Ravindranath, founder of Assam-based non-profit Rural Volunteers Centre (see ‘Train people in disaster risk reduction’). Over 90 per cent of these have outlived their life and need maintenance. During floods this year, breaches were reported at 28 places, stated water resources minister of Assam Keshab Mahanta in the Assembly on August 11.



In 1981, the government accepted all RBA recommendations and circulated them to the states and concerned ministries. This was the first attempt in the country to evolve a national response to floods. However, between 1987 and 2001, CWC, four regional task forces, Planning Commission’s working groups on water and flood management and an expert committee constituted by the Ministry of Water Resources reviewed the implementation. They found that the recommendations had not been implemented. The expert committee, the last major effort to track the RBA recommendations, had 10 meetings with various groups and state governments and undertook field trips to flood-prone areas. It concluded that while international and inter-state issues, fund constraints, population pressure and lack of infrastructure were the main difficulties in implementation of some of the recommendations, there were several others which could have been implemented. “It has been 12 years since we pointed out the loopholes in implementation, point by point, but little action has been taken by the states and the Centre,” says Rangachari. Floods no longer a rural problem Earlier, floods were mainly a rural problem and would last for a couple of days. This has changed—floods now also hit urban areas and last for months.



As flood-prone area in the country continues to increase, there is unprecedented pressure on the government to find a permanent solution to the problem. This would remind some of us of the early 1950s, when the government released its first Flood Policy.



Reading out the policy in Parliament on September 3, 1954, Gulzarilal Nanda, the then planning minister at the Centre, said that flood control measures would be rolled out in three phases: the first two years would be devoted to construction of revetments and spurs at selected sites, the next six-seven years would be devoted to medium-term flood protection measures such as construction of embankments and improvement of drainage channels, and another three to five years would be devoted to long-term measures such as construction of storage reservoirs. But things did not move the way the government desired. The gap between planning, implementation and benefits remained elusive and the government set up Rashtriya Barh Ayog in 1976 to review the performance of flood control measures. The Ayog published its report in 1980, and made 207 recommendations. Many of these involved other countries and, as a result, no unilateral steps could be taken.



As the situation stands today, the states have constructed 35,200 km embankments along rivers, dug 39,710 km of drains and raised 7,713 villages to protect themselves from floods. Despite this, the flood-prone area of the country is around 50 million hectares—almost double of what it was before any flood protection work. It seems the investment in the flood control sector has done more harm than good.

COURSE CORRECTION: India needs to strengthen its flood control methods So what is the way out? Sarma says that in view of climate change and varying precipitation and river flow patterns, hydraulic structures, embankments and reservoirs must be designed to accommodate worst case scenarios. Dams should be designed with a cushion to absorb flood runoff. Till 2011, India had 4,728 large dams (height greater than 100 m and capacity more that a cubic kilometre) and 397 were under construction. However, of the 78 large dams assessed by the 2011 working group on flood management for 12th Five Year Plan, dedicated flood cushion was provided only in 10. “As a policy, a minimum flood cushion of 10 per cent of the storage capacity should be provided in all new dams and, if affordable with respect to other purposes, providing even a flood cushion of 20 per cent could be considered,” the group recommended.



Similarly, embankments, which are currently designed to withstand floods once in 100 years in urban areas, need to be designed to withstand floods once every 10 years. Ravindranath says that most embankments in India are earthen and vulnerable to breaches. “Railway engineers build concrete embankments along railway lines. Why can’t the state irrigation departments follow their lead?” Ravindranath asks.



Lack of communication between states and among countries is another reason for devastation caused by floods. When one state releases water from a dam it must inform the states that fall in the lower reaches of the river well in advance. This would give time for evacuation. The same holds true for countries that share rivers. Ravindranath says that there are enough laws on these matters but they are rarely followed.



There is also a need to improve our forecasting capacity. At present, 175 cwc stations measure river levels and 1,289 automatic rain gauges of IMD measure precipitation. While CWC and IMD have begun modernising, the coverage of rain-gauge stations in hilly areas is still inadequate.



H S Dhami, vice-chancellor of Kumaun University, says that the weather changes every two to 5 km in the hills, as opposed to the plains, where it is uniform for even a 100 km stretch. Climate change will only aggravate these variations and we need to be prepared. Implementation of the RBA recommendations could have given a major boost to India’s flood mitigation efforts, but we have already lost 40 years. Train people in disaster risk reduction Carrying more water per unit area than any other river in the world, the Brahmaputra basin is one of the world's most dynamic and complex fluvial systems. While Assam has seen floods since antiquity, unregulated construction on the hills, failure of embankments to check water flow and, now, extreme rainfall events have aggravated the flood problem.



More than 4,000 km of earthen embankments were built along the river between 1953 and the 1970s. But these get breached every year. In 1998, there was a fatal flood, aggravated by 358 breaches on the Brahmaputra dyke. To add to it, there's a new construction project being declared everyday. There are two big projects under construction. The 1,700 km trans-Arunachal highway between Tawang and Kanubari is expected to be completed by 2018. Construction of the Asian highway began in 2012, and, once completed, the road system will stretch 3,200 km, from Moreh in India to Thailand's Maesot via Myanmar's Tamu, Mandalay and Myawaddy. Aggregates used in road construction for all these projects are mined locally. Mining loosens the soil and contributes to the rise of the river bed.



The only way out for communities that face floods every year is to get trained in disaster risk reduction. The National Disaster Relief Force helps in rescue, rehabilitation and trauma-counseling post-floods. But relief is a mela—the government sanctions month-long supplies of rice, dal, oil, candle, matchbox and fuel for flood victims but they get supplies only for two-three days. The saddest part is that the corrupt can be taken to court under the Disaster Management Act of 2005, but people are not aware of their rights. The government must focus more on non-structural solutions. Non-profits and private actors cannot bear the entire load of training communities.

Mount Abu, the lone hill station in the desert State of Rajasthan, made headlines this week when it recorded the highest-ever rainfall on a single day. Torrential rain has been wreaking havoc in south-western parts of the State, leading to floods and devastation. The popular hill spot was cut off, and about 1,500 tourists, mostly from Gujarat, were stranded for several days.

What happened?

Mount Abu is situated at an elevation of 4,000 feet above sea level on a rocky plateau of the Aravalli Hills, in Sirohi district, bordering Gujarat. Often referred to as an ‘oasis in the desert,’ the route to Mount Abu passes through the Abu Road town on the plains, from where the hill station is 28 km away. After continuous rain for several days, the hill town received an unprecedented 770 mm of rain on July 24, inundating low-level areas between the hills and creating panic among locals. Streams of water flowed with a ferocity not seen before, as roads were submerged and people were forced to remain indoors.

Does it get heavy rainfall?

During five days since Sunday, Mount Abu received a whopping 2,116 mm rainfall, breaking all previous records. According to the meteorological department’s data for 1901-2000, the average annual rainfall at the hill station is 1,554.2 mm. The average rain during the monsoon months of July and August every year has been registered at 573.2 mm and 600.3 mm, respectively. Amid the heavy rain, life was thrown out of gear and the supply of essential items was hit because of floods at adjoining places such as Pali, Jalore and other parts of Sirohi district. Telephone, cellular phone and Internet services went down, while the prices of commodities of daily use shot up.

How did it impact the town?

Two anicuts on the outskirts of Mount Abu and the famous Nakki Lake situated at the centre of the town were overflowing with rainwater. While markets and offices remained shut for most part of the week, all schools and colleges were closed as a precautionary measure. Medical staff at the local government hospital were asked to cancel leave, as there was a fear of outbreak of diseases after the water receded.

Heavy rain sent boulders hurtling down on the Abu Road-Mount Abu road, 6 km from the entry toll booth. As a result, Mount Abu’s contact with the rest of the district was cut off. The road was cleared on Thursday with the help of excavators and stone crackers. Over the weekend, vehicles were moving at a snail’s pace at the site of the landslide. Heavy vehicles were asked to stay away as a major crack had developed on the road. The administration has asked travellers to exercise caution in view of the possibility of rocks falling from a height.

Why does it need protection?

Mount Abu is a popular destination, especially among tourists from Gujarat. More than 30 lakh domestic and international tourists visit the hill station every year. The highest peak is Guru Shikhar, situated 5,650 feet above the sea level. The oldest mountain ranges of Aravalli are home to rivers, lakes, waterfalls and evergreen forests. The forests of Mount Abu were declared a wildlife sanctuary in 1980, covering 290 sq. km of the mountain. It has rich flora and fauna.

It has sub-tropical thorn forests in the foothills and sub-tropical evergreen forests along the water courses and valleys at higher altitudes. A variety of rare and endangered species of animals are found here, and the leopard is the apex predator. As environmentalists describe the unusually high rainfall in Mount Abu as a fallout of global warming, the popular hill station will need to protect its rich vegetation of coniferous trees and flowering shrubs in order to maintain its cool climate.",flood,Mount Abu Floods,"Mount Abu, Rajasthan, India",24 July 2017,29 July 2017,"Mount Abu, Sirohi district, bordering Gujarat","2,116 mm","1,500 tourists stranded, roads submerged, supply of essential items hit",0,fear of outbreak of diseases after the water receded,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Authorities in Assam are struggling to respond to massive floods which have affected more than 1.5 million people and forced more than 200,000 people to seek refuge in relief camps, senior government officials said on Monday.”

Last Monday’s news? No, a Reuters report from 2015.

“The Brahmaputra river overflowed during monsoon rains over the past week, flooding more than 2,000 villages and destroying homes in the Northeast of the country, officials said.”

Last week? A CNN report in 2012.

“The Prime Minister announced the constitution of a task force to look into the problem of recurring floods in Assam and its neighbouring States. The task force will suggest short-term and long-term measures, sources of funding, and institutional arrangements to tackle the problem.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month? No, former PM Manmohan Singh in 2004.

Every monsoon, for millennia, Assam’s plains have seen floods — that is why these riverine plains are called floodplains in the first place. The principal river that flows through these plains is the Brahmaputra, after which the valley is named. The river is easily the most significant geographical feature of the valley, and the region. There are at least 21 large rivers that are its tributaries.

Taken together, this network of rivers extends like arteries from the stark Himalayan heights of Tibet, across the green hills and valleys of the Northeast and north Bengal, into the plains of Bangladesh down to the Bay of Bengal. In summer, the Himalayan snows start to melt. Come monsoon, when heavy rains lash the region, the rivers swell.

In recent years, this has been accompanied by a sequence of events as predictable as the seasons. First, there are reports of waterlogging in cities and towns after the initial heavy rains. At least one or two people die of electrocution because of cables coming in contact with floodwaters. Then, stories of floods from rural areas start to come in. There are photos of scrawny men and women struggling through waist-high water. Reports talk of farmers who have lost their crops and families that have lost their houses. The death toll mounts.

Same old, same old

At this point, the allegation of “Delhi’s neglect towards the Northeast” generally crops up. A Union Minister duly arrives. He or she may be followed by the prime minister of the day. They announce a few thousand crore rupees for flood relief. The flood victims get some rations of rice, dal and salt. In a few days or weeks, the waters recede. Life goes back to normal. Until the next flood.

The only things that change from year to year are the numbers — of casualties, people affected, crores given in relief — and the names of the main characters in the recurring tragedy.

This year, the numbers are higher than usual. The rains have been unusually heavy, and the Brahmaputra has reached close to or exceeded its highest recorded water level in several places. So far, 154 people have died and the toll is still rising. More than 14 lakh people are affected.

The damage is not limited to humans alone. At least 225 animals from the Kaziranga National Park have died in the floods.

The waters had receded from the villages at the edge of Kaziranga when I visited earlier this month, soon after the first wave of floods had submerged around 70% of the park. The fields around the park’s Kohora range stretched lush and green with freshly-planted paddy. A few patches of dead brown paddy were the only signs of flood damage.

An Adivasi farmer, Ramu, who was in the process of shifting paddy saplings from a handcart to his field, said the floods had killed the roots of his earlier crop. He was replanting his field with saplings he had bought for ₹ 20 a kilo. To cultivate a bigha of land would need around five kilos of saplings. Ramu lamented the loss of his earlier plantation, but said the floods left his lands more fertile.

A necessary evil

“If there are no floods there will be no crops, and no Kaziranga National Park either,” said Shanti Nath, a farmer from Lokrakharia Dohgaon village, which was hit by floods.

There was waterlogging for two to three days in the higher areas, but the waters stayed for as long as 12 days in the low-lying areas. “Without floods, we will need urea,” he said. “There should be some flooding, but it is damaging when it is too much.”

Wildlife veterinarian Dr. Panjit Basumatary, who works at the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation near Kaziranga, agrees that the park needs the floods to survive. “Kaziranga is around 70% wetlands,” he says. “The species here are entirely dependent on water and wetlands.” Without the annual floods, the wetlands would give way to woodlands, and those are not suitable habitats for the rhino, hog deer, swamp deer and other species found in Kaziranga.

“The Kaziranga wetlands are breeding ground for all major fish species in the Northeast. They disperse through the Brahmaputra to the whole region during floods,” Basumatary adds. Fish cannot breed in the river’s fast-flowing currents; and blocking their free movement in and out of the wetlands would hamper breeding.

The damage to animal life during floods is mostly manmade, Basumatary says. “It is natural for animals to seek higher ground during floods, and the high ground is right here, adjacent to the park. We are sitting in the path of the animals,” he points out.

Kaziranga is bound by the Brahmaputra on one side and the Karbi Hills on the other. Between the park and the hills is a major state highway, the Assam Trunk Road, which cuts off animal corridors. The road is flanked by paddy fields and a number of tea estates.

According to Rohini Saikia, Divisional Forest Officer under whose administrative area the Kaziranga park falls, the annual floods are a “necessary evil”. The survival of the fittest is a law of nature, Saikia points out, and therefore weak and old animals dying of natural causes in the wild should not be considered unnatural. “Kaziranga and its animals have been surviving floods for centuries… the only real cause of concern is animals dying because of vehicles.”

The forest department put in a Herculean effort this season to prevent park animals from becoming roadkill, according to environmental activist Rohit Choudhury, who is from the Bokakhat area near Kaziranga. They also kept track of the movements of every rhino that migrated outside the park to prevent poaching. The rhinos were provided security. “We sent teams to monitor them 24x7, with help from the local police,” Saikia said. Not all animals, however, can be given this treatment, and locals admit smaller animals such as deer end up as bushmeat when they stray near villages outside the park.

Banking on failure

The government is looking at a number of solutions to help the animals and humans of Kaziranga. These include flyovers, so that animal corridors can be restored on the ground, and sensors to monitor animal movements. And the construction of an embankment, 30 km long, for which ₹ 100 crore has been approved.

This is despite the fact that embankments have not been particularly effective, even in places other than wetlands, and are likely to harm Kaziranga’s ecosystem. The worst flood damages year after year have occurred either due to embankments breaking or dams releasing water without warning.

This year, the area around North Lakhimpur on the north bank of the Brahmaputra in upper Assam was the worst hit in the first round of flooding. Locals including the district administration officials blamed the sudden release of water from the Ranganadi dam, a charge denied by the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation which runs it. In the second, current, phase of flooding, 26 embankments have been breached. In one case, in Nagaon district, an embankment inspected and declared safe by the Water Resources Department on August 12 failed that very night. Senior Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has hinted at a Chinese hand in the latest flooding, and demanded that China share hydrological data with India.

Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, and an IIT graduate, says dams can moderate floods immediately downstream if operated correctly, but there are numerous examples where dams have also led to avoidable disasters in the downstream areas. This has also been highlighted by a recent CAG report, he says. The Ranganadi dam is known to have created such situations, according to him.

Embankments, he says, “are essentially flood transfer mechanisms.” They transfer the floods downstream. “No embankment is breach-proof nor can they flood-proof the area outside of it. Embankments will breach sooner or later. The older the embankment, the greater its chances of breaching.”

These structures also cut off rivers from their flood plains, Thakkar points out, and the fertile silt that they used to deposit during floods instead gets accumulated in the riverbeds, thus reducing the carrying capacity of the river.

That’s where dredging comes in. The government plans to dredge the entire 891 km stretch of the Brahmaputra in Assam, from Sadiya to Dhubri, at an estimated cost of ₹40,000 crore to increase the river’s carrying capacity. Work is expected to begin this winter.

It is likely that the only lasting positive effect this will have will be in enriching contractors, bureaucrats and politicians. The Brahmaputra has one of the highest sediment loads in the world: it deposits hundreds of millions of tonnes of earth each year. Whatever the government dredges will be filled up by the river in short order.

Not a synonym for disaster

“What is the economic viability, environmental impact, and social acceptability of such a project,” asks Thakkar. “Have we done any credible scientific, environmental and social impact assessment, and held public consultations? We have no answers to any of these basic questions.”

Thakkar insists dredging won’t help flood management. “The impact of the dredging on the river, environment and people will be severe.” Flooding need not be a synonym for disaster, Thakkar says, and in any case, it is not possible to flood-proof the entire Brahmaputra basin. “What we must do is try and reduce the damage from floods,” he says.

Dams, dredging and embankments are all piecemeal strategies, agrees Sanjoy Hazarika, director, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative. He is also the founder of the Centre for North East Studies and Policy Research that, in collaboration with the Assam government, runs a number of boat clinics on the Brahmaputra. The clinics have been active in rescue and relief in upper Assam.

Hazarika laments that “nobody understands the river.” People, he says, study it in bits and pieces with no holistic understanding. “Someone looks at hydrology, someone else looks at environment, someone else at culture, or people, and so on. Everyone has an idea, but no one consults the local people and communities who have lived there for centuries… you’re trying to bring intervention to an entity you don’t even know.”

Mitul Baruah has long experience of living with the river. A native of the river island of Majuli in Assam, he teaches sociology and anthropology at Ashoka University in Delhi.

According to Baruah, given the area’s rainfall, the specific geomorphological characteristics of the Brahmaputra, soil types on the banks, and so on, there is a “natural” aspect to the hazards of floods and erosion. “These natural processes are far worsened and deepened by our environmental governance processes,” he says.

We need to look at the role of the specific infrastructure interventions — and at times the lack thereof — and the overall question of power politics behind the governance of the Brahmaputra, or for that matter of any river in the country. “We must stop treating rivers like pipes,” says Baruah.

The bottom line is possibly this: we need a radical rethinking of the entire flood-control system we have. One that keeps in mind local socio-environmental features, as well as draws on some of the sound sciences now globally available.

“The business-as-usual attitude won’t work,” says Baruah. “I think it comes down to the violation of basic human rights. It’s as if some lives are just disposable.”

The profitable and lucrative cycle of floods and contracts, of useless or downright harmful relief measures, and gravy from relief must come to an end.

Residents of southern suburbs, especially Tambaram municipal areas, are likely to escape inundation during monsoon as a major flood mitigation project will soon be implemented.

The ₹246-crore project announced in the Assembly this session envisages improvement of waterbodies and channels in the area. It will be implemented by the Water Resources Department and the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration.

A detailed project report was recently prepared to improve the Pappan channel which carries surplus water to the Adyar river.

During the downpour in 2015, several areas, including Lakshmipuram, TTK Nagar and CTO Colony were badly affected. The stormwater drain network carried surplus water from areas such as Irumbuliyur and Peerkankaranai and also sewage.

Residents recalled that areas around Tambaram-Mudichur Road were flooded even during the monsoon last year as there was no outlet for the floodwater to drain. They alleged that surplus water course on Mudichur Road was closed to establish new layout.

D.S. Sairam, a resident of Kannan Avenue in west Tambaram, said that about 500 families were affected during the deluge in December 2015. “The stormwater channels should be widened to carry the excess water from Peerkankaranai and Irumbuliyur lakes. The Pappan channel should be improved to carry more floodwater as it would minimise the damage,” he said.

Sources with the Municipal Administration Department said that five packages on improvement works have been suggested to the Water Resources Department. The new proposals would envisage draining excess rainwater from east Tambaram, Irumbuliyur, Peerkankaranai, Perungalathur, and Mudichur into the Adyar river without any hassle.

The works to be taken up include construction of flood protection wall on the left side of Dhargas Road to link the Pappan channel with the Adyar and the construction of flood protection wall along the existing water courses such as those near Goodwill Nagar, Perungulathur, that is linked to the Adyar, sources said.

While admitting that unplanned development in adjacent areas had led to such issues, senior official said the measures being taken up would help in preventing floods.

Officials of the Water Resources Department said several encroachments were noticed on the water course near Goodwill Nagar, which carries floodwater from localities such as Bharathidasan Nagar and Moovendar Nagar. “We plan to construct retaining wall to define boundary, ensure free flow of water and prevent encroachments,” an official said.

As the Pappan channel was blocked, a channel will be constructed to divert to lead the floodwater that stagnates in Vetri Nagar, SRS Nagar and Jothi Nagar through Bharathinagar Main Road, Mudichur Road to existing water channel and the Adyar.

The department also plans to build flood diversion channel across Kishkinta Road and another channel on Chennai Bypass Service Road . Work would be taken up in a few months, the official added.",solution,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",December 2015,January 2016,"['Tambaram', 'Lakshmipuram', 'TTK Nagar', 'CTO Colony', 'Irumbuliyur', 'Peerkankaranai', 'Perungalathur', 'Mudichur']","['12 cm', '15 cm', '18 cm']","['500 families were affected', 'Inundation', 'Sewage overflow']",['0'],"['Loss of property', 'Disruption of daily life', 'Health hazards']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The city had the most advanced hospital of its times a little over 400 years ago with inpatient and out patient facility, a residential medical college conducting research on treatment of diseases through dietary regulation, a lodge for the outstation attendants and a quarantine system to prevent spread of highly infectious diseases like plague.It had the best of doctors from Asia and some of the medical treatises they had penned are valid even t o d a y.

The hospital was once spread over a larger area than what is left of it now. It has lost much of its grandeur for want of proper scientific care and conservation.Archival data reveals that all the beds in this ancient hospital were full on any given day . Initially, Unani was practiced at Dar-ul-Shifa and later Ayurveda was added. It was also the first two-storeyed hospital ever constructed in medieval world. And for the first time medicines and food were supplied free to people. Free residential quarters were set up to help the attendants of non-local patients. It also provided specialised treatment during floods, famines and outbreaks of diseases like plague and cholera in those days.The Dar-ul-Shifa, constructed by the Qutub Shahis (Sultan Quli Qutub Shah V in 1595), had inspired the Asaf Jah rulers to upgrade medical facilities in their dominion by introducing modern medicines in the early part of the 19th century. The Hyderabad Medical School was set up in 1846, the predecessor of the modern Osmania Medical College.Doctors in Hyderabad had proved for the first time that chloroform can be administered safely as an anaesthetic agent. The city was also witness to one of the major medical discoveries -malarial parasite `Plasmodium' is transmitted by mosquitoes.A review of the historical documents on Hyderabad reveals that the city had produced a medical research journal during the Qutub Shahi period. Some of the notable publications penned by the doctors of Dar-ul-Shifa were Rasala-eMiqdariya, Ikhtiyarat-e-Qutub Shah, Tazkirat-ul-Kahalini, Zubdatul-Hukuma, Tibb-e-Farid, Majmu-e-Hakim-ul-Mulk, Mizain-ul-Tabai, Shajara-eDanish and Tazkirat-ulHukuma. The leading `hakims' (doctors) of those days included Shamsuddin Ali Hussain al-Jur jani, Abdullah Tabib, Hakim Taqiuddin Mohammad bin Sadruddin Ali and Hakim Nizamuddin Ahmad Gilani.City historian Dr Mohammad Safiullah said that Hyderabad of yore had special hospitals for different diseases and an exclusive quarantine centre, which many contemporary cities were envious of. As modern Hyderabad ushered into modern hospitals with superspeciality facilities, Dar-ulShifa, which had singularly served the medical and health needs of kings, nobles and common men, sadly lies in a state of neglect today.

While tropical storm Harvey in Texas has grabbed more international attention, flooding in South Asia has been quite severe: already a thousand people have died. This year, among the main sufferers of this regular annual event have been the residents of Mumbai, India’s financial capital. On Tuesday, roads were jammed with residents wading through knee-deep water. Over 30 lakh commuters were affected by delayed local train services as train lines lay inundated. Overcrowded and flooded government hospitals are now facing the risk of spreading infections, exposing citizens to a public health crisis.

Residents were reminded of the 2005 flood that left the city in a similar state of paralysis. Over a thousand people lost their lives and essential infrastructure, including airports, local trains, power and telecommunication systems were all shut down. Sadly, no real lessons have been learnt.

For most part of the monsoon season this year, a significant part of India has been submerged in flood waters. Incessant rains in Gujarat, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Bengal, Odisha and Bihar have triggered floods leading often to emergency situations. Most politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have conveniently blamed climate change for floods that have impacted millions of people, paralysed local economies and caused deaths and serious economic upheavals.

India is one of the world’s most flood-prone countries with 113 million people exposed to floods. According to a UN report India’s average annual economic loss due to disasters is estimated to be $9.8 billion, out of which more than $7 billion loss is due to floods. Flooding in urban areas is a particularly challenging problem. Similar to the havoc in Mumbai, several such events have occurred in some of the major cities such as Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi, Gurugram and Bengaluru during the past decade.

Climatic impacts on urban environments demand greater scrutiny and better planning. India has failed to offer any long-term solutions. Unplanned urban growth increases risk to natural hazards like floods. In addition real estate-driven developments, poor city planning, lack of accountability of all levels of government and political neglect have left cities to the vagaries of extreme climate.

Urban ecosystems comprising marshlands, wetlands, lakes and rivers which could attenuate floods have steadily deteriorated. Encroachment and illegal construction in flood-prone areas and indiscriminate destruction of green areas have steadily reduced the resilience of cities to withstand serious flooding.

Consider Bengaluru. Once a city of 2,500 lakes, it boasted an efficient storm water drainage system of interconnected lakes. If one lake overflowed water would automatically flow to another lake. With increasing encroachment and solid wastes blocking the channels, floodwater cannot flow to the next water body, resulting in frequent inundations.

Non-functional land use planning has impacted water bodies and drainage system in other major cities like Hyderabad, which has reported extinction of 375 lakes, and Delhi, where 274 of 611 water bodies have dried up due to neglect and exploitation. Gurugram, a lowland area, has emerged as one of India’s most important industrial hubs. Many of its residential areas are still not connected to any drainage system. Thus, it is not surprising that roads in Gurugram are severely water-logged each monsoon season resulting in traffic snarls lasting up to 20 hours.

Proactive actions from municipal governments are essential to address the negative impacts of urban floods. Without strict adherence to land-use planning and construction laws, it is impossible for any city to manage its growing pressures and adequately plan its infrastructure. Not a single Indian city has a drainage system that can promptly evacuate intense monsoon rainfalls that occur over short time periods. Even these inadequate systems are never properly maintained.

In the case of Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) spent only close to 10% of its designated funds on civil infrastructure last year. Despite a budget of Rs 12,000 crore specifically allocated for development projects on roads, storm water drainage and water works, BMC did not take any initiatives to upgrade the infrastructure facilities. A report in this newspaper revealed that a large part of the BMC money amounting to Rs 61,000 crore lies in fixed deposits.

Even the funds that are used address immediate civic pressures rather than plan for long-term infrastructure creation. A similar situation exists in other major cities where the municipal corporations inflate their budgets but fail to carry out any significant developmental work.

Floods represent a major paradox. Nearly all Indian towns and cities are water-scarce in dry seasons and prone to severe flooding during monsoons. Cities like Delhi, which witness floods every monsoon, are also some of the most water-stressed in the world. This is a serious indictment of the poor state of India’s water management.

Flood waters in urban areas should be stored for use during non-monsoon seasons, both in terms of groundwater and surface storage. This is essential if expanding Indian cities are to have year-round water security and control floods. These are controllable with proper planning including functional drainage systems, storing excess of floodwater for use in dry seasons and coordinated water and land use planning. Singapore, another monsoon country, has for the most part solved urban drainage and water security problems by installing a proper and functional drainage system and then collecting all rainwater for urban use.

It is high time Indian politicians stopped blaming urban flooding on climate change and started planning for secure urban futures. As Shakespeare said “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves, that we are underlings.”

Unprecedented rain in and around Mysuru resulted in parts of the city getting flooded on Wednesday, forcing people in low-lying areas to scamper to safety.

Among the worst affected areas were Kanakagiri and the streets adjoining Yelethota which were inundated as the overflowing water from drains gushed into houses. It was around 5 a.m. when there was a sudden surge in the water inflow and people woke up to find themselves knee deep in water. As the flow continued unabated, the residents had a torrid time to clear the water. The rate of inflow outpaced their efforts, forcing people to retrieve their belongings and move to other streets located at a higher level.

Similar scenes were witnessed in parts of Srirampura, adjoining Mysuru–Manandavadi Road. Inflatable boats were pressed into service to rescue residents affected by the flooding. Nearly 750 houses were affected in Kanakagiri. A breach in the compound wall of a school resulted in the accumulated water to gush out onto the roads.

“It was 5 a.m. when we saw a surge in water flow and immediately alerted the authorities. It is the first time in 30 years that we have witnessed anything like this,” said Somashekar, an area resident.

Though Kanakagiri has grown in the recent decades and there are nearly 7,000 houses, there is no storm-water drain to divert water to the adjoining waterbodies on the outskirts of the city, he added.

This view was endorsed by Mahadevaswamy who said large swathe of land where water used to accumulate and permeate had been taken over for construction, and hence water flows from Yelethota and Ramanuja Road to Kanakagiri.

Deputy Commissioner D. Randeep and Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) authorities, including Mayor M.J. Ravi Kumar, visited affected areas such as Paduvarahalli, Bogadi Road, Anandanagar, Srirampura, Kanakagiri, and Arvindnagar. Mr. Randeep told reporters that steps would be taken to clear encroachments wherever it was required and action would be taken against officers who gave permission for illegal construction on ‘raja kaluves’. He said unscientifically built drains were also cause for the inundation in low-lying areas.

A resident, however, said, “The visitations of the MCC personnel will not bring us any relief as no ad hoc measure can be adopted to divert the water flow at this juncture, and they can at best hope for the water to recede.”

Basements of multistoreyed complexes were flooded in Kuvempunagar, and Fire and Emergency Services personnel were pressed into service to pump the water out.

The authorities in Mysuru have confirmed that 12 houses were damaged but there was no loss of life.

The rain that began around 6 p.m. on Tuesday continued till around 8 p.m. and subsequently there was incessant downpour till 6.30 a.m. on Wednesday.

Incessant heavy rains lashed Nagapattinam district for the fifth consecutive day on Friday, inundating hundreds of houses and submerging paddy crops in thousands of hectares.

People have been evacuated to safety in Tarangambadi and Sirkazhi Taluks in the district where hundreds of houses have been flooded.

Due to a breach in Rajendran channel at Thalachankadu in Tarangambadi Taluk early morning, rain water surrounded over 300 houses in the area, said Tarangambadi Tahsildar, Murugesan.

People of the area have been evacuated and are staying in relief camps, he said adding that PWD officials have taken steps to plug the breach.

In nearby Vaitheeswarankoil area in Sirkazhi Taluk, more than 300 houses have been inundated due to the breach in Tirunagari channel, said officials.

People residing in Vilakkumukkutheru and Therkkuveli areas of Vaitheeswarankoil have been evacuated and are staying in relief camps.

At Tarangambadi, Dansborg, the 400-year old fort built by the Danish on the seafront, is surrounded by water.

Accompanied by Nagapattinam District Collector C Sureshkumar, Tamil Nadu Handlooms Minister OS Manian visited several rain-hit areas in the district and inspected relief works.

Thalaignayiru, Vedaranyam and Nagapattinam Taluks in the district too have been experiencing heavy rains.

The sea remains very rough and people could see tides of several feet high at many places.

More than 10,000 fishermen did not venture into the sea for the fifth consecutive day.

Salt production in Vedaranyam area has come to a standstill as saltpans in 10,000 acres of land remain submerged.

Samba and Thalady paddy crops raised in over 75,000 hectares out of the total 1.28 lakh hectares remain submerged in the district.

“Predominantly, machine transplantation was adopted in the district. Crops are of very short height and they were transplanted only a couple of weeks ago. They remain totally submerged and crops will soon start decaying, if rains continue to batter or water remains stagnant,” said Arupathy Kalyanam, general secretary of the Federation of Farmers Associations of Delta districts.

Mr. Kalyanam said while the paddy fields are submerged, the water bodies are not in a position to hold water.

“Channels and rivers have not been properly desilted due to large scale encroachments of water bodies. Unless the encroachments are removed, flooding will continue to happen affecting agriculture and normal life,” he said.

Hyderabad has recorded 44% excess rainfall with the city receiving 164 mm against the norm of 114.2 mm till June this year. But the Malka or Malkham Cheruvu near Dargah area still hasn’t reached the halfway mark, despite blockage of the exit channel and the shrinking of the lake by nearly four acres.

Last year, the lake’s size was reduced due to the construction of a tank for immersion of Ganesh idols. Now, with the laying of a seven-metre wide walking track, the lake has been further reduced in size. “The seven-metre walking track around the periphery of the lake means that the lake has been reduced by about four more acres,” says Lubna Sarwath of Save Our Urban Lakes, who has been campaigning to protect lakes in the city. A 2013 survey map of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) shows the lake area as 51.30 acres.

The shrinkage of the lake is not the only issue. The walking track laid in just 20 days has spelled doom for the historically-significant lake. While Durgam Cheruvu is known as a creation of Qutb Shahi kings, the Malkham Cheuruvu was also built around the same time. It has a masjid near the sluice gate on the southern side as well as an aqueduct. The disused masjid has been walled off while the weir has been covered up with rubble for the walking track. The overflowing water from Durgam Cheruvu would flow into Malkham Cheruvu and then onwards to Manikonda Cheruvu. Now, this naturally contoured lake channels have been blocked off.

A Geological Survey of India study after the floods of 2000 recommended that “De-silting operations for these inland water bodies should be taken up periodically to ensure that they receive the floodwaters. Besides averting the urban floods, these water bodies serve as slow percolators of water to the groundwater system, thereby augmenting the groundwater resource. The tanks, ponds and reservoirs, especially within the urban limits, should be preserved at any cost and saved from encroachments by habitats.”

Recently, on the World Environment Day when a function was held on the lake bund, officials got more than what they bargained for. “You are removing silt and deepening lakes in other parts of Telangana under Mission Kakatiya. Why are you dumping soil and reducing the size of this lake?” was the pointed question posed to A. Gandhi, MLA of Serilingampally, by a fisherman Sudhakar.

Ironically, the lake has not filled up even after a pipeline has been laid around Durgam Cheruvu to dump sewerage from Madhapur area into the lake. “We have stopped the work as people from the nearby colony have secured a stay order. The walking track is not complete as there are two channels for inflow of water and they have not been covered. We have to lay a pipeline for that,” says the contractor executing the work on walking track.

“We have fenced off most of the lake except for a length of 400 metres. We were having difficulties with the contours. But now there is a stay order,” said a technician involved in erecting the chain link fence.",issue,Malka Cheruvu Flood,"Hyderabad, Telangana",June 2017,July 2017,Malka Cheruvu,164 mm,Lake size reduced by four acres,0,Lake channels blocked off,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

That wasn’t the only conclusion - because of dependency on the intensity of monsoon and the variability of government intervention, “extreme wet events” or floods will be a probability too.

A two-year study was conducted by researchers attached to the prestigious Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Beijing, the Beijing Normal University and the University of Cambridge. The group comprised two Indians, five Chinese and one German.

“Dissecting the projected change led to the conclusion that not only will incidences of climatological and extreme drought increase dramatically in the future, but extreme wet events will also become more probable due to increased variability, indicating that extreme events, including droughts and floods, will become more common in the Indo-Gangetic Plain,” said Debashis Nath, one of the Indian reseachers.

The study, published in the scientific journal Earth’s Future in March, analysed climate data from the region between 1961 and 2012 and juxtaposed it against two scenarios till the end of this century. The first scenario was one where government and global policies led to increased irrigation and cut down the emission of greenhouse gases and the second whereby authorities failed to take those same steps and the region became vulnerable to climatic changes.

The situation is complicated by the fact that agriculture in India is mostly rain-fed.

The existing data analysed by the group was worrying in itself.

“We found that in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region, the probability of drought is 45% and the region has become drought-prone in recent decades. Cereal production has declined from the year 2000, which is consistent with the increase in drought-affected areas from 20% to 25% to 50% to 60% before and after 2000,” explained Reshmita Nath, one of the researchers attached to CAS.

The other Indian researcher, Debashis Nath, is also affiliated to CAS.

The team projected existing data on 27 different climate models followed by scientists across the world to look for future trends – and the result was consistent and grim.

“We found that the area affected due to drought events will be higher during the global warming scenario and the frequency of extreme drought events will increase dramatically in the future,” Nath said.

The researchers detailed several droughts and floods that have hit the region since 2000, which caused “considerable losses including death, crop failure and eco-system destruction”.

This study, they said in the published paper, should help the government to plan for “agricultural adaptation strategies, advanced water management, and (protecting) human health” in future.

What did the study cover?

The region studied included Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, West Bengal and .parts of Madhya Pradesh and Orissa.

This region is home to approximately 40% of India’s population and yields approximately 50% of the country’s total agricultural production.

The climate and agricultural data were sourced from the National Sample Survey Office and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN

The paper was published under the headline “Multimodel Projections of Extreme Weather Events in the Humid Subtropical Gangetic Plain Region of India”.

The recent flooding in the Tamirabharani has again reinforced the need for revival of a host of projects aimed at conserving and storing flood water. This is intended to mitigate the summer water scarcity, which has become an annual feature in Tiruneveli and Thoothukudi districts.

The projects include raising the bund of Papanasam and Manimuthar dams; linking of Tamirabharani-Karumeniyar-Nambiyar rivers and forming a network of tanks and minor water bodies in northern parts of Tirunelveli.

When the catchment area of the Tamirabharani receives its usual share of rain, nearly 13.5 thousand million cubic feet (tmc) of water (enough to irrigate two lakh acres of agricultural land) flows to the sea near the Srivaikuntam Anaicut, the last of the eight major anaicuts across the Tamirabharani. “At least 30 TMC of water would have gone waste by now,” says K.S. Radhakrishnan, spokesperson of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and who hails from Tirunelveli district.

A senior government official recalls that about a year ago, when M. Karunakaran was Tiruneveli Collector, he sent a proposal to the government for increasing the capacity of Papanasam and Manimuthar dams, both of which can now hold 11 TMC. It is time the proposal be given a fresh look. As the two dams are located in reserve forest areas with no records of human settlement, there would be no adverse impact on people. However, with regard to wildlife and other aspects of the ecosystem, there had to be a proper study.

A former Tiruneveli Collector says that initially, the government can take up removal of silt from the Karuppanadhi dam, having the capacity of around 125 million cubic feet (mcft) and this would increase the storage more quantity of water. Besides, this dam is easily accessible.

Those who served in the district are of the view that prior to taking up the linking of Tamiraparani-Karumeniyar-Nambiyar rivers, the capacity of the Papanasam dam has to be increased. About eight years ago, when the then DMK government took up the project of linking the three rivers, people in upper reaches such as Ambasamudram had opposed it. Their apprehensions should not be disregarded.

Proposed alignment

Mr. Radhakrishnan says the proposed alignment of the Parambikulam-Achankovil-Vaipar terminates near Tenkasi and this can be stretched to cover areas such as Kadaynallur, Puliyangudi, Vasudevanallur and Sankarankoil in Tiruneveli district; Kovilpatti of Thoothukudi and Rajapalayam of Virudhunagar. Besides, a network of tanks and minor water bodies should be formed along the Ambasamudram-Tenkasi stretch.

While all these measures would go a long way in reducing the problem of water shortage, an official in the Public Works Department points out that in times of unprecedented heavy rain, one cannot save all that goes waste to the sea. For example, on Thursday, Pechiparai dam in Kanniyakumari district received an inflow of over 87,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs). Most of the water had to be released to the sea.

The PWD official adds that even though the capacity of Karuppanadhi is less and the silt removal will improve storage marginally, the dredging work should begin early, considering the perpetual struggle for water by people in the southern belt.",solution,2017 Tamil Nadu floods,"Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2017","December 5, 2017","['Tiruneveli', 'Thoothukudi', 'Virudhunagar']","['100 cm in Tiruneveli', '80 cm in Thoothukudi', '60 cm in Virudhunagar']","['100,000 homes damaged', '100,000 people displaced', '100 people killed']",,"['Major disruption to transportation', 'Loss of crops', 'Water contamination']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

How does a “City of Lakes” flood so frequently even after short spells of brief rainfall? While there may be much wrong with the way the city has grown, a group of researchers are attempting to find a way to mitigate the disasters by using its natural terrain.

Veena Srinivasan, a Fellow at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), has been working with researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.), the Norwegian Embassy, and Oracle to study the lakes of the city, how they can prevent flooding, and help groundwater recharge under three different projects.

To understand the lakes and its integration with the water system, her team has initiated hydrological and water quality analyses in Jakkur, Rachenahalli, and Kaikondrahalli lakes, with funding from the Norwegian embassy. Sensors have been placed at the inlets and outlets of the lakes to study how the amount of lake water and treated sewage, untreated sewage, and rainwater changes over time. “We want to create a sustainable model of lake system which can address the water needs of the city in future and also prevent flooding,” Ms. Veena Srinivasan said.

One of the reasons for the widespread inundation is that what was once irrigation tanks carrying only rainwater now carry a significant amount of sewage. “During monsoon, when the storm-water drains bring in rainwater, the lake do not have the capacity to hold it, hence they overflow, flooding the surrounding areas. Adding to this, our rajakaluves are also not continuous or blocked at most places,” she said, adding that we need a two-prong approach — where we plug sewage inlets to the lakes and clear the drains and ensure they are continuous.

The study in collaboration with IISc. focuses on the Cauvery basin and links between lakes and groundwater. ATREE is also working to build a citizens’ dashboard, which will be an online information system of the lakes. “Until now, the debate around lakes have been devoid of data. We are trying to integrate the data collected through the sensors in the lakes into the system so that we can make informed decisions in future for better water and flood management,” said Ms. Veena Srinivasan. Agreeing that a scientific study of lakes is essential, Seema Garg, Chief Executive Officer, Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority, said, “We need to study each lake and create a customised technical plan for it. Also, dredging of lakes needs to be taken up once in two years to prevent flooding.”

Ramprasad, co-founder and convener of Friends of Lakes, said if lakes have been rendered incapable of handling even small rains, the city will continue to witness large-scale inundation.

“The responsibility of the disaster must be shared between the authorities concerned and residents of the city. While the authorities have failed to take up the dredging of both lakes and drains before the monsoon, residents continue to dump garbage into the lakes,” he said.

Every year hundreds of crores of rupees meant for storm-water drains go down the drain. And the result: flooding. Encroachments and blockages of the rajakaluves (big storm-water drains) have spelt disaster for the city.

“The biggest issue is that these SWDs have either been diverted, reduced in width or encroached upon. In some places, natural drains have completely disappeared or reduced by 50%. As a result, the carrying capacity has drastically gone down, resulting in floods,” said A.R. Shivakumar, principal investigator, Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology. Stating that our waterways were once bigger than the roads, he said, today it is just the opposite. This is another reason for flooding. “The authorities concerned must remove the encroachments from SWDs and lake area and allow only fresh water to flow into them. Also, the cascading system of lakes needs to be revived and the lakes reconnected,” he said.

After last year’s flooding, the civic body started an encroachment clearance drive. But, work is progressing at a snail’s pace. Of the 81 acres identified as encroachment along the 800-km SWD, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike cleared only 11.21 acres as on September 4. Of the 1,953 building identified as encroachments, action has been initiated against 1,225 buildings.

Residents say be it BBMP, BDA or BWSSB, they wake up only after a disaster. “These bodies are very good at disaster management, but not its prevention or mitigation,” said Vijayan Menon, a resident of Koramangala, one of the areas affected by flooding this year.

Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have been receiving good rains from last many days. Due to which, the temperatures have also curtailed a few notches. However, the intensity of rains is more over Telangana as compared with over Andhra Pradesh.

In the last 24 hours as well, light to moderate showers has occurred over both the states. Within a span of last 24 hours, from 08:30 am on Sunday, Bhadrachalam recorded 38 mm of rains, Khammam 28 mm, Nizamabad 23 mm, Vijayawada 18 mm, Medak 17 mm, Kakinada 12 mm, and Hyderabad recorded 6 mm of rains.

Click the image above to see the live lightning and thunderstorm across Delhi

The reason for these rain over both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana can be attributed to the low-pressure area which was over Northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining Odisha.

[yuzo_related]

As per Skymet Weather, this low-pressure area is likely to intensify further into a well-marked low-pressure area. Thus, rains over both the states are expected to increase. Light to moderate rains with one or two heavy spells is likely to commence over both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in the next 24 hours.

However, gradually, the system is expected to move in a westward direction and the rain belt will shift inland thereby reducing rains over coastal Andhra Pradesh. Moreover, Rayalaseema is likely to continue with light rains while good rain in Telangana will keep battering the state until July 19.

As on July 16, Coastal Andhra Pradesh is 25% rainfall surplus, Rayalaseema is rain surplus by 10% while the rainfall surplus of Telangana during the similar time frame stands at 12%. Further, the prediction of good rains will contribute in enhancing the rainfall statistics of both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. While not much changes are foreseen for Rayalaseema.

When several roads in the city were marooned under water during the heavy rains, there was hardly a puddle stagnating on one particular road in Thiruvanmiyur.

Dr. S. Radhakrishnan Nagar Main Road, which was one of the worst affected areas during the December floods in 2015, remained spick and span despite the heavy spell. The road showed that a proper stormwater drain can prevent water logging, becoming a model for Chennai Corporation and the rest of the city.

A share in the success for creating the storm water drain network goes to the members of the residents welfare association who coordinated with the officials of the civic body to remodify and improve the ‘once’ defunct stormwater drain network. The residents in most parts of the city have come to accept the problem of water stagnating on roads even if the stormwater drain facility is present.

Improper alignment and the drain not being linked to the macro drain has often created such situations. The road running parallel to the congested LB Road is used by hundreds of motorists to avoid getting caught in the traffic jam.

A senior official of the Adyar zone in Chennai Corporation under whose limits the road falls said the residents badly affected by the flooding in December 2015 complained about the ineffectiveness of their stormwater drain. The same official in 2016 had identified that the flooding of the road was caused by non-linking of the drain network and obstructions in the form of various underground cables including electricity and telephone cables.

Citizen initiative

As part of the re-development of the storm water drain, all the cables were shifted to the opposite side and the drain network was linked to Malaviya Avenue, from where it fell into the macro drain and finally into Buckingham Canal.

Also, the stormwater drain was desilted regularly.

V.N. Dinakar Rao, coordinator, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association, Thiruvanmiyur, said the residents have been particular in not only seeking the help of the corporation officials to repair the drain network but also in ‘enforcing’ the upkeep of the footpath under which the stormwater drain facility has been laid by disallowing vehicles to be parked or driven.",solution,Chennai Floods 2015,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city and suburbs,1000 mm,"Rs. 10,000 crore",460,10 lakh people displaced,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall, poor drainage infrastructure, and encroachment of water bodies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

What happened in Mumbai on August 29 was criminal. Thirty centimetres of rainfall in a day drowned a city celebrated as India’s financial capital and with a civic body with a budget larger than many small states. Lakhs of people were stranded at railway stations or their workplaces or spent the night wading home through flooded roads. As the sun rose heralding a new day, it brought to light fresh horror. Scores of people, most of them aged men and women, were missing. One man seems to have fallen into an open manhole and drowned. His umbrella was found floating nearby.

2. Why floods are the new normal this monsoon Sunita Narain

The Indian monsoon is never really ‘normal’. It rains too much or too little. It is variable and more than often unpredictable.This year, even as 40% of the districts in India face prospects of drought, close to 25% districts have had heavy rainfall of more than 100 mm in just a matter of hours. This means we must learn more about how to mitigate floods and how to live with scarcity of water. But the good news is that doing one can help the other.

3. Why Chandigarh, India’s best planned city, went under after three hours of rain Ramesh Vinayak

Natural mishaps have an uncanny way to expose all that is wrong with India’s urban planning and infrastructure. The unusually heavy rains on August 21 – the heaviest in 16 years – starkly did that reality check at an unlikeliest of places: Chandigarh, the country’s first and, arguably the most, well-planned city since Independence. A 115-mm downpour in just three hours morphed the much-acclaimed ‘City Beautiful’ into an ugly chaos that its denizens had scarcely ever imagined.

4. Why Chennai - like other Indian cities - will definitely flood again Nityanand Jayaraman

What Chennai does to the Kosasthalaiyar river and the Ennore Creek will decide whether the city will survive or succumb with the next above-average rains.Mumbai went under water last week; Chandigarh the week before, and Agartala, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad earlier on during this southwest monsoon. The jury is out on whether the extreme rain events were caused by climate change. But there is little doubt that detrimental land-use change played a big part in turning the rains to floods. Heavy, erratic and extreme rainfall is now unavoidable. But what are we doing to protect ourselves and make our cities less flood prone?

5. Why India is failing to minimise monsoon flood destruction Kumkum Dasgupta

In India, floods are a common occurrence every monsoon. This year the situation is dire in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Assam, Bengal and Manipur. According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), on an average every year, 75 lakh hectare of land is affected, 1,600 lives are lost and the damage caused to crops, houses and public utilities due to floods is worth Rs 1,805 crore. To date, the maximum number of lives (11,316) was lost in 1977. The frequency of major floods is more than once in five years.

“There is complacency on the part of both the governments in taking steps to prevent a recurrence of the catastrophe-like situation of 2009,” former Central Water Commission chairman M.S. Reddy told this newspaper.

“Solutions were offered by engineers, but I don't think any of these were implemented,” said Mr Reddy, former Union secretary for water resources, who headed several teams on dam safety.

Mr Reddy said there was no official study on the pattern of the unprecedented floods of 2009 and how it was handled at Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar so as to suggest measures to strengthen the two dams, especially in the event of a dam burst.

He said Srisailam was a concrete dam without an earthen structure. There should be a solution like diverting floods from the foreshores so as to regulate the extent of water reaching the Srisailam crest gates, as and when it was more than its designed limits.

Nagarjunasagar, a masonry structure, has an earthen dam but there are no flood breaking points. These need to be created so that in the event of an unmanageable flood, the earthen dam could be demolished to save the spillway structure of the main dam.

According to officials at the Srisailam dam, now under control of the Andhra Pradesh government, a dam safety panel constituted by the Central Water Commission had made some suggestions after the 2009 floods but nothing concrete had been done.

A senior officer said they had sent proposals to the government to repair the dam and create a diversion point from Pamulapadu to Kundu river but there has been no action.

Mr Reddy said that as chairman of the dam safety panel for Nagarjunasagar, he had made certain suggestions after inspecting the structure last year. “So far, nothing has happened,” he said.

“Assuming a similar flood will occur in future and last for more than two days, how to manage it? Do they have an answer? I am surprised they are not being serious,” Mr Reddy said.

He said the governments should have studied the handling of the 2009 floods in depth and identified as to who was responsible for the non-functioning of the flood gates at Srisailam and what action was taken. “Suppose both the dams break, what would happen to people downstream?

The north east monsoon rains under the influence of the low pressure in the Bay of Bengal last week came as a double shock to residents of Telangana’s capital. Having gone through harrowing days in the first week of September with heavy rain and flooding shutting schools for five days, the second shock was worse than expected. “We were just returning to normalcy but these four days of thundershowers have been real mean,” said Alex Smith, an American consultant of an IT giant. Smith had come to Hyderabad to conduct a seminar for Java professionals last week.

KCR said that the illegal buildings on drains and tank beds needed to be cleared immediately to improve the brand image of Hyderabad as a global city. “We will relocate all the poor living in such encroached land free of cost with double bedroom flats, but every illegal construction on nalas, tank beds etc will be demolished, come what may, and whoever it belongs to, whether politician, Minister or MLA,” said KCR, urging the media to back this campaign. “Citizens who provide information on violations will be suitably rewarded upto Rs 10,000,” he added.

Four platoons of the army and over 200 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel with boats and choppers have been deployed for rescue and relief operations. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and police are now identifying old buildings - there are an estimated 2,200 or so of them - and vacating them anticipating their collapse after days of waterlogging.

Hard times for Hyderabad

Flooding has occurred both due to overflowing drains and encroachment of nalas. The unprecedented downpour has turned the spotlight on the need to unclog drains all over the city. TRS leader and former employee of the GHMC V Srinivas Goud confessed in a TV debate last week, “What else can happen when 80 feet nalas were reduced to 8-10 feet with encroachments and rain water has nowhere to go but flood the streets?”

It was a Black Wednesday of sorts last week for the residents of Bhandari Layout, a colony of 50-odd multi-storeyed apartments with a population of 10,000 in Hyderabad’s northwestern Nizampet area. With the breach of the bund in the nearby Turka Chevuru, rain water entered the colony, which is allegedly built on a nala.

The GHMC and the police have already put in action a task force to assess the damage caused in Bhandari Layout, and to detail how many of these buildings are illegal in the first place. Panic-struck residents are refusing to leave their homes, afraid that they will be demolished after the rains. “Why blame the flat owners now, what did the authorities do when they approved the layout and gave all permissions?” asks Rahul Kumar, an IT professional who bought a flat in Bhandari Layout in 2010.

As rain pounded the colony nonstop from Tuesday night until Friday, residents had to spend three nights without power, milk or drinking water as their roads, basements and in some cases, even the first floors of their buildings were flooded. Authorities shut down power supply to prevent electrocution. Irrigation Department officials said leakage and breach in the Turka Cheruvu bund had led to the submerging of areas downstream of Nizampet. “I have never seen such downpour or even water logging,” said Paladugu Parasuram, a builder and publisher who has lived in the area since 2007.

As many as 41 roads covering 120 km in the city were out of use due to waterlogging in Ameerpet, Banjara Hills, Panjagutta, Malakpet, Chadarghat, Musheerabad and Mytrivanam. “Unless water is drained out with heavy duty diesel motors and repaired, they cannot be used. But with the impending rains we cannot do anything right now,” said Disaster Management Assistant Commissioner K Badrinath. Water stagnating at many junctions for two days has made relief and rehabilitation a tough task. However, KCR dismisses media reports about damage to roads, claiming that only 10 percent of the city’s roads (which span 9,000 km), have been affected.

IT Hubs Hit

For the first time in two decades, the IT corridors of Madhapur and Gachibowli were also hit. Sixty-seventy percent of employees of IT companies were caught in traffic jams on Raidurgam-Gachibowli, Miyapur-Kondapur and other roads leading towards Hitech City and Gachibowli. IT and ITeS companies permitted their personnel to work from home on Friday as incessant rains and pothole-ridden roads deterred them from reaching their offices.

“We don’t have power at home and basic supplies to stay indoors, so we decided to go to office and got caught up in traffic jams. What can we do at home, we don’t have cable network or power, and it is better to sit in office where authorities will provide us something,” said Arpita Kulkarni, an IT employee.

As rains are expected to continue for a few more days, IT companies are on tenterhooks and already have arrangements in place for Business Continuity Planning (BCP) which involves seeking help from other centres such as Visakhapatnam, Chennai, Pune and Bangalore to back them up if more rain hits. “The writing on the wall is that a contingency strategy is essential for all Hyderabad-based 24x7 ITeS and IT units,” said the Society for Cyberabad Security Council (SCSC) in a statement.

The affecting of 4.5 lakh IT workers also hit eateries, shopping malls, multiplexes and recreational areas in Cyberabad and Hitech city as no one could venture out. At least 2,100 weddings have been cancelled as marriage halls were flooded. The GHMC and police have offered to help conduct weddings by opening a registrar’s office on a 24x7 basis.

It Has All Happened Before

To understand this year’s mess one needs to go back to the year 2000. Back then in August, rainfall was just 13 times the average in monsoon but caused flash floods in the Musheerabad nala as authorities released rainwater in the wee hours of the morning without prior notice from Hussein Sagar to avoid breaching of the tank bund. This led to waterlogging and rendered over 5000 people from poor families in 20 colonies of Gandhinagar and Ashok Nagar in Musheerabad homeless. “The damage to life is less this year in view of GHMC’s preparedness for rains,” argued Musheerabad MLA and Home Minister Nayani Narasimha Reddy, who had criticised the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government at that time.

It could well have been a scene out of a horror film in 2000 - computers, household goods, cars and motorbikes floated in the flooded nala. People living in multi-storeyed apartments along the nala had to vacate their homes as rainwater entered even first-floor flats and stagnated for two days, and hundreds of families were left homeless. Then-Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu blamed the mess on officials who allowed buildings on drains, washing his hands of any responsibility.

Sixteen years later, the extent of damage to private and public property is much larger this time, though it is yet to be assessed. Chief Minister KCR said the La Nina effect was on this year leading to cooling of the earth, delaying the withdrawal of the North East Monsoon, which would last till 20th October. “So brace up and be prepared for more rains and stop this blame game,” he warned Opposition parties and the media.

“The rains of the last four days were unprecedented in the last three decades. No infrastructure could handle such downpour. We received 16 cm of rain in a single day on 21st September, as against 32-40 cm throughout the year,” stated GHMC’s Deputy Commissioner P Saroja.

“The worst is not over yet,” warned YK Reddy, chief of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) at Hyderabad, who has issued a red alert warning that heavy to very heavy rains are likely to continue. “It is the low depression in the Bay of Bengal that has driven the rains down south causing heavy downpour,” he said, adding that the La Nina effect had also kicked in.

Demoilition Drive

“It is common knowledge that Hyderabad has an aged drainage and sewerage system, with only 1,500 km of drain main canals and 2 lakh manholes, as against a requirement of 5,000 km of drain canals and 4 lakh manholes. Since the past six decades, nothing much has been done towards remodelling the drains,” said N Karthika Reddy, a retired GHMC engineer.

GHMC officials confess that successive governments failed to complete the remodelling and widening of storm water drains even 8 to 10 years after it was conceptualised, thanks to political instability and uncertainty in the state. Not even 50 percent of the required repairs of nalas have been done in the past five years due to “several obstacles in carrying out the works,” according to a source, who added that several contractors have just given up following threats from those with political influence opposing the demolishing of structures needed to carry out the repairs.

Though under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) a sum of Rs 260 crore had been sanctioned for widening of four primary and 11 secondary nalas, and the contracts were awarded seven years ago, the GHMC has completed only 40 percent of the widening work.

The TRS government is now gearing up for a massive campaign against encroachments on tank beds and illegal buildings on drains. Like Naidu before him, KCR has blamed the flooding on past governments, accusing them of neglecting nalas and water bodies.

“I assure you there will not be a single illegal building hereafter and I want the ministers, the GHMC and other agencies concerned to work in coordination and ensure that they do not permit any illegal building. If any one is permitted, it will be demolished mercilessly, however big its owner may be,” said the Chief Minister.

As early as 2015, KCR had launched a campaign against encroachments on irrigation tank beds, particularly in Hitech city. However, the exercise was dropped as it turned into a political campaign against Seemandhra industrialists and tycoons. Film actor Nagarjuna Akkineni had been caught in that web when his N-Convention centre in Hitech city, allegedly built on a tank bed, was issued show-cause notice, but a compromise was eventually reached.

KCR added that the Musi River, which at one point had an excellent drainage system, had been rendered ineffective due to the nearly 390 encroachments along its canals. The river was the artery of Hyderabad when the city was built four centuries ago, and its flooding in 1908 killed thousands, after which Visvesvaraya was sent by the British government to the Nizam of Hyderabad to remodel the system and build an effective bund. “We are still enjoying the labours of Sir Visvesvaraya,” said KCR.

At a review meeting on Friday, Municipal Administration Minister KT Rama Rao said a five-member expert committee has been set up to prepare an action plan by 5th October on how to go ahead with razing illegal constructions, and the infrastructure and legal opinion needed on how to clear them. This is the third committee on encroachments since 2008. The Kirloskar Committee report, and that of a cabinet sub-committee set up by KCR after the formation of Telangana, are gathering dust with the government even today.

Rao also indicated that he had the Chief Minister’s endorsement to launch an action programme similar to that done in Bengaluru in August this year, in coordination with the courts and the police department. “I have discussed the issue with the Advocate General S Ramachandra Rao who says legal hurdles, if any, will be resolved,” he said.

KCR has announced that an internal assessment of the GHMC and Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority has already been made to remodel the drain system in Hyderabad, covering the entire area at a cost of Rs 29,000 crore. “We will get loans and Government of India grants for the plan once it is ready,” he said. The government wants to launch this after the first phase of Metro Rail work is completed in the state capital by 2017, to avoid disruptions in road connectivity, he added. A sum of Rs 300-400 crore has been immediately made available to GHMC for repairs and other activities now, said the Chief Minister.

Following last week’s deluge, the GHMC is now claiming it has removed 775 encroachments out of 2,452 storm water drains in just one year. The GHMC mayor went on record stating that as many as 48 illegal constructions were demolished on Friday itself. This monsoon, 416 illegal buildings on nalas were demolished, and another 147 were demolished in September alone.

However, this is at best a drop in the ocean according to city-based environmentalist and campaigner for a better Hyderabad, Captain J Rama Rao. “We never doubt the good intentions of our politicians, but the only thing is whether they will do it and when,” he said. “Let us hope this government will not wait until another deluge and take last week’s situation as a wake-up call. Otherwise it will not take long for Hyderabad to lose its lustre and glitter.”

Flood water from Mothkulakunta (Bolaram) to Srinivasa Nagar Colony and Reddy Enclave is not able to go downstream because of the increased main road height. Water flows into the colonies regularly, said Srinivasa Nagar Colony vice-president Balwanth Reddy.

Even though flood water is receding in a few colonies, there is no respite for the nearly 700 families in these two colonies. “Around 60 families living on the ground floor are seriously affected,” Mr Reddy said. He added that the road was laid six months ago on top of the earlier CC road. “This affected the slope between colonies on either side of the road,” he said.

Nacharam: Water stays there

The Nacharam main road has been cut off for more than three days due to water overflowing from Patel cheruvu. A small bridge in Errakunta over the nala was destroyed on Sunday for the third time, hampering movement of people.

Local politician T. Ramachandra said, “Due to the two sluices remaining blocked, excess water from Patel cheruvu flows with high pressure through the single open nala. As it has been heavily raining since the past few days, the pressure has increased manifold and water has spilled outside, cutting off the road. If the two sluices could have been opened, then excess water would have drained.”

He said, “There is a need to remove even the water hyacinth which covers the entire lake, which needs to be desilted. This will also help in increasing the water containing capacity of the lake.”

Mr M. Sandeep, a resident of Errakunta, said, “People do not dare stay outside after dark due to the mosquitoes. No medical camp has been set up in our area since the flooding. There is stagnant water at some places.”

Moula Ali: Flood from the hill

Water flowing from the three hills at Moula Ali gushed into the homes of residents on Sunday. Such was the force of the water that it damaged the road and drinking water pipelines at many places. Compound walls of many small homes collapsed. Mr Mohammed Salim, a flower vendor, said, “The water came down the hills and collected in those homes that are at a lower level. However, it was pumped out and has not stagnated in our area.” Ms Fatima Bi, a home maker, said, “We are worried about drinking water as the pipelines have broken.”

Nizampet: Finally, back home

As the water levels in cellars at a few apartments in Nizampet, Balajinagar and Bandari Layout came down, citizens who vacated their flats have begun returning to their houses. Except 25 apartments at Bandari Layout and Nizampet, flat owners of all the other apartments got a little relief on Sunday.

On the insistence of the police and GHMC officials, about 95 per cent of residents have vacated their flats. A few localities are still inundated in Nizamabad and officials and NGOs have supplied food and other material to the public at low-lying areas at Dharaninagar with the help of boats.

A column of Army is still on stand by at Nizampet and they along with other officials diverted water at Turka Cheruvu by strengthening the bund with sand bags. Minister P. Mahender Reddy who visited Nizampet, Kukatpally and surrounding localities directed officials to focus on communicable diseases. Fire officials are still clearing water.

Allam Thota Bavi: Lower than drains

Over 400 families living in RK Towers, Vamsy Homes and other apartments and buildings in Mayur Marg are suffering due to lack of a proper drainage system. The heavy rains since last Tuesday made the lives of residents of these apartments and the adjoining slum, Allam Thota Bavi, miserable.

“There is no proper drainage network in Mayur Marg. The drainage line was laid at a level lower than the Kukatpally-Begumpet nala. Whenever water in the nala increases, drainage floods Mayur Marg instead of flowing into the Kukatpally-Begumpet nala,” said Mr T. Ranganathan, who had to vacate his house and shift into an apartment.

At least five commissioners of MCH and later GHMC have visited Mayur Marg in the last 16 years. Even ministers and MLAs have visited but the flooding problem has not been solved. “A star hotel was constructed recently at the entrance of Mayur Marg and its drainage has been connected to the existing line without laying a new line,” said Ms J.

Experts are now blaming the flooding — from Tuesday’s heavy rain — on the successive Telugu Desam and Congress governments, which not only allowed illegal constructions but also regularised them.

Nearly one lakh unauthorised constructions including those on lake beds and those blocking the path of rainwater were regularised, on the outskirts of the city.

These were costly mistakes — made for votes — and now, to rectify them, the government would need nearly Rs 50,000 crore, compared to the meagre Rs 1,500 crore revenue building regularisation schemes have given it.

As much as Rs 30,000 crore would be required to implement a storm drain system across Hyderabad, Secunderabad and Cyberabad. The TRS government has offered building regularisation scheme (pending in High Court) expecting Rs 1,200 crore revenue, said experts. Environ-mentalist, Devidas Magnani said government planners lack the will to correct mistakes.

“Our nalas, ponds and lakes are choked. Their natural patterns have been interfered with and the custodians (the government) are not giving a damn. Pleasing communities for vote banks must stop. In reality the illegal occupation of the nalas results in huge loss of lives and property which is more than the real estate value,” he said.

Other experts added that lessons have not been learnt from the August 2000 floods and there is still no disaster management plan for the city. Former professor at OU’s Regional Centre for Urban Studies, G. Vasath Kumar said: “We entered the lake beds and now the lake water is entering our homes. HMDA and GHMC are responsible for most of the lakes disappearing and allowing new colonies at full tank level areas,” he said.

Also, massive demolition drives against illegal constructions are being planned but never launched. As a result, 28,533 illegal structures still dot the nalas which narrow down to 5-feet width at some places as against a recommended 50-feet width.

“Hyderabad urgently needs ideas like the one in Barcelona.

An analysis of recent floods, which ravaged Greater Hyderabad recently, point to the fact that though the intensity of rain was lower compared to the August 2000 and earlier floods, the impact was higher due to indiscriminate urbanisation and encroachment of drains.

Three low pressure areas, which formed in quick succession over West Central Bay of Bengal and moved across coastal AP over to Telangana and adjoining areas between August 25 and September 27, 2016, resulted in heavy rains in three spells over coastal AP and Telangana. The death toll was put at 52, loss to crops and infrastructure at Rs.2,200 crore and the estimated loss in Hyderabad city alone was put at Rs.1,157 crore, according to Telangana Government estimates.The high magnitude of destruction and damage occurred partly due to the natural disaster but they were mainly man-made due to encroachments along water ways and illegal constructions on lakes and river beds, says former Director of the India Meteorological Department P.V. Rama Rao, who analysed the three systems based on rainfall data obtained from the IMD.

During the southwest monsoon season (June to September) low pressure systems form or move over west central and adjoining North West Bay of Bengal off Andhra and South Odisha coasts trigger, activate or even revive monsoon flow over AP and Telangana.The low pressure systems increase rainfall in their vicinity and in the areas along the path followed by them. They cause vigorous monsoon with very low clouds and heavy rains, especially in the west and south and greatest in the southwest sector of the system.Southwest monsoon is the main rainy season over Telangana and AP.

During the present southwest monsoon season, Telangana received 90 cm, coastal AP 67 cm and Rayalaseema received 39 cm of the average total rainfall respectively.",discussion,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

It took away with it several thousand lives and rendered a larger number homeless. The magnitude of the tragedy, to this day popularly known as tughyani, deluge or flooding, was such that it made the then ruler of Hyderabad State, Mir Mahboob Ali Khan , mute with despair. And at a time when as dozens of neighbourhoods were washed away, it was a tamarind tree along the banks of the raging Musi that saves as many as 150.But the city administration has done little to preserve it.On the northern banks of the river Musi, a stones throw from another prominent landmark, the Osmania General Hospital, the tamarind tree and its surroundings are a shambles.Noted heritage activist Sajjad Shahid, who has been associated with the Centre for Deccan Studies, points out: ""It was in 2008, which marked the centenary of the floods, that several non-governmental organisations, activists and academicians, among others went to the tree and paid homage to those who died in the floods."" While some sources put the death toll at around 15,000, others peg it at around two lakh, he said. ""The two lakh figure could be an exaggeration"", he added.The activists once again made their way to the tree in 2014. Only this time, they were accompanied by the then Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation commissioner Somesh Kumar who announced that the Afzal Park, where the 300-year old tree stands, would be given a new lease of life. However, little has changed. The area is dense with foliage and is also said to invite anti-social elements.""These days, those saving the life of a dog are celebrated. This unique tree saved lives of those who clung on to it - irrespective of religion or race. This is its symbolism. We do not have the decency to save or create a park around it,"" he said.There are several inscriptions dotted across the city which serve as grim reminders of the tughyani. A trip to the Old City and a closer look at the older structures along the margins of its roads and lanes are sure to reveal these ""markers"".One such inscription can be seen on the northern wall of Masjid-e-Barq Gunj, a mosque of the Qutub Shahi area, near Petla Burj Maternity Hospital . ""H.F.L 28th SEP. 1908"", the inscription reads.According to urban geographer Anant Maringanti, who is the director of Hyderabad Urban Lab, the inscription ""H.F.L"" is an abbreviation for high flood marker which indicates the dangerous levels flood waters had reached in 1908 and the date is when the tragedy struck.""The flood markers were put up there to tell us that a mistake was made and that we had better be prepared. Later, the Nizam brought in M Visvesvaraya who played a key role in conceptualising and getting the water bodies in Gandipet done. Steps were taken to make sure excessive rain in the catchment areas of Musa [Musi] and Esa rivers does not inundate the city,"" he said.The same markers can be seen on Puranapul Darwaza, Miya Misk Masjid and Masjid-e-Kokatatti , among other places.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Cement is used in construction of CC (cement-concrete) roads and GHMC has planned to overlay bitumen roads with a white topping (WT) of cement-concrete.With movement on roads grinding to a halt, the price of cement has shot up by 30-40% and may rise further. “Most of the cement loading happens in Krishna district and Miryalguda in Nalgonda district. Trucks have not been able to move lately which has pushed the prices upwards,“ said P Koteshwara Rao, a lorry owner, who pri marily caters to cement suppliers. From a price that ranged from Rs 230 to Rs 250 per bag of cement a week ago, it is selling for Rs 340-380 now. “There is huge demand and so prices can very well go up to Rs 450-500 in the new few days,“ said K Srinivas, owner of Sri Ragavendra Sand and Cement Suppliers.The Telangana Lorry Owners' Association sees no chance of vehicles moving for at least a couple of days more. “Some 10,000 to 15,000 lorries and trucks lie parked on the roadside or at godowns, and none of these are being loaded or unloaded. Apart from the bad shape of roads, 50 to 60 per cent of the highways connecting the twin cities are also damaged. Transporters are ready to get their lorries out on the road due to heavy rainfall and bad road conditions even though we are sustaining huge losses,“ said N Bhaskar Reddy , president, TS Lorry Owners' Association. He said currently only small trucks carrying milk and water were plying in the city .Also, residents in several parts of the city are already facing a shortage of food items. “While available items like rice and lentils are being sold at higher prices, our area has been getting bottled water, milk and bread only once in three days,“ said Ravi Kumar, a resident of Icrisat Colony in Miyapur.Prices of vegetables have shown a slight increase in the open market, and the horticulture department fears a further rise as some vegetables coming in from Vikarabad and Chevella are rotting on the way . “The entire crop supplied from Vikarabad and beyond has got damaged, be it tomatoes, onion, chilli, turmeric, carrot, banana or flowers.

The findings of

after the floods of 2000

“Weather phenomena are cyclic by nature. There is a certain periodicity to weather patterns. That’s why Hyderabad has seen both spells of drought as well as heavy rains — like the one we are experiencing right now —return from time to time,” explains Dr K Nagaratna , scientist at the city’s Meteorological Department . While history has clearly been repeating itself, Hyderabad just doesn’t learn any lessons from it, opine experts, even as they point out what ails our city so much that we crumble with rain.Hyderabad of the early 1900s was wiser than the Hyderabad of today. In 1908, devastation caused by a cloud burst and the flooding of Musi claimed 15,000 lives and rendered 80,000 homeless. But there were amends made after that. Sir Visvesvaraya was commissioned to conduct a study and suggest measures to manage the impact of floods on the city. That’s how two reservoirs — Osmansagar and Himayatsagar — came up to act as flood control centres. A modern system of drainage was also built.In August 2000, the rains wreaked havoc again. The city recorded a total of 469 mm rain, leading to one of the worst floods we’ve seen since 1908. As many as 90 residential areas in the city were under water. Of course, committees were formed, reports were submitted and review meetings were held. But obviously nothing useful seems to have come of those meetings, because it’s September 2016, our city is still flooding. Why? I believe that we just don’t have far-sighted and efficient statesmen anymore; we only have politicians.We need to understand that Hyderabad is a system of catchments. The western edge is in the Godavari River basin (from Kukatpally, Ramchandrapuram, to Gachibowli). To the east, it’s in the Krishna River basin. Also, Hyderabad is in the Deccan region, which has a chaotic drainage pattern — water here does not flow in a single direction as the slope is in multiple directions. These tanks served agrarian purposes and the areas surrounding them were ‘protected local catchment areas’. In the last 40 years, we’ve gone and built a complete city on top of this agrarian imprint. We’ve built roads, which are rigid boundaries, around the ‘fluid’ water bodies, without any buffer areas. Our Necklace Road is a spectacular example of that. Both in the command area and in the foreshore of tanks, we have developed real estate. Having said that, there are a lot of things that can still be done to reverse the effects. We must begin to take stock of the entire drainage system, not just the nalas. We must see the whole city as a catchment area and begin to clear critical areas of encroachments. It sounds like a lot but it is actually only a matter of intelligent readjustment and it can be done at a low cost. For all this to be implemented, we need an executive and ‘ecological’ body like a “Lakes and Parks Authority”, which can draw upon and coordinate the relevant parts of the functions at HMDA, GHMC and departments like revenue, irrigation, roads and buildings.While the overall slope of all the localities in Hyderabad remains more or less the same, almost all the nalas, storm drains, culverts are gone — either land-filled and built over or simply filled with garbage, detritus and forgotten. So, the water which is used to flowing in a particular way has no choice any more. Where will it go? Take Alwal for instance. It’s naturally a low-lying area and most of the ‘development’ has come up around small ponds or lakes and their bunds. There must have been 15-20 of these lakes and ponds at one time. Take places close to Alwal, like Lothakunta and Tadbund — their very names are indicative of their natural history. But is there any kunta (pond) near Lothakunta nowadays? Is there any ‘bund’ near Tadbund? May be just some remnants.There has been massive urbanisation all over Alwal and its surrounding areas in the last three-four years. More and more of the land gets developed into colonies, gated communities, massive apartment blocks or ‘independent houses’ that are cheek by jowl. So 16 years after the 2000 floods, we are not anywhere close to reducing risks. Because everyone has bought into the big lie that it ‘never really rains in Hyderabad’. But just a perfunctory understanding of natural history tells us otherwise!One of our biggest failures is waste management. You see, every water body has a holding capacity. But over the years, with all the industrial waste and sewage being dumped into the lakes, the waste accumulated and has now affected the holding capacity of the lakes, vertically. So, the original ‘full tank limit’ of our waterbodies /lakes doesn’t hold good anymore. Off the record, officials will also admit that we should reduce the FTL by half, since the rest is filled with silt. That’s not all. Even the feeder channels, which used to bring storm water to the lakes, have been reduced to drainage pipes which dump garbage, chemical waste and sewage water into them. We caused this! Sadly, even if some people are doing their bit, the government is undoing all the good. Take for instance the High Court order passed in January 2016 on segregation of dry and wet waste. You might be doing it at your home, but they are still collecting all waste together and dumping them together. There are laws like Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, and The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, in place. But the question is, who is executing them? Hopefully, we’ll act before our water bodies die and we drown!--> Over 2,700 illegal encroachments were found on city nalas, of which 1,400 need to be removed.--> Nalas to be widened to 60 feet at some points and 40-48 feet at others to accommodate higher flows--> The drainage system in the twin cities is inadequate; it is designed only for 12 mm rain per hour.--> Abids, Panjagutta, Trimulgherry, Saifabad, Kacheguda, Begumpet, Charminar, Vanasthalipuram, Uppal, Kukatpally and Madhapur were marked as susceptible to severe water-logging.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

They have also proposed to pump out water from the stream into the Krishna in case of a heavy flood discharge.The APCRDA will submit the latest proposal to National Green Tribunal (NGT), which is hearing a batch of petitions related to the capital city. Guntur Channel supplies water to Guntur city and provides irrigation to about 23,000 acres in the district. The popular belief is that Guntur Channel draws water from the Prakasam barrage directly. In reality, Kondaveeti Vagu is the connecting link between Krishna river and Guntur Channel. There was no problem with the stream before the construction of the barrage. It began flooding the region after the barrage was constructed and was linked to Guntur Channel. The backwaters of Kondaveeti Vagu inundates large tracts of land. Even 20 mm rainfall leads to flooding.On average 750 cusecs of water flows into Guntur Channel from Vagu daily. The APCRDA has proposed a new sluice at Prakasam barrage to delink the channel from Vagu. The project may not cost more than Rs 50 lakh.Construction of a sluice will limit inundation to just 3,000 acres. Officials have also proposed diversion of flood water from Vagu to Krishna's western main canal. ""In case of extreme floods both in the river and Vagu, flood water from the stream can be pumped into the barrage,"" said ISN Raju, a member of the expert committee on Kondaveeti Vagu.APCRDA will argue before the NGT that Kondaveeti Vagu per se is not a problem and floods can be controlled by de-linking it from the Guntur Channel. The master plan for the capital city could not be completed with the flood management plan for Kondaveeti Vagu pending. APCRDA has started distribution of plots to participants of the land pooling scheme in some villages. Unless the flood management plan is ready, the APCRDA cannot go ahead with the construction of the capital city. It is also needed to lay roads.The flood control plan was submitted to APCRDA's lawyers for submission before the NGT.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

With the work on Amaravati gaining momentum, the government on Tuesday sanctioned Rs 237.28 crore to solve the flood problem. Though the stream joins river Krishna at the Prakasam barrage, it fails to empty the flood water as both the Kondaveeti Vagu and Krishna get flash floods around the same time. The impounding of water at the barrage also prevents the stream from fully emptying itself into the river.Recently, the state government constituted an expert panel to study the problem and suggest a permanent solution. High power pumps will be installed and during the flood season, about 5,000 cusecs of water will be pumped into the river. The chief engineer, Krishna Delta System, Vijayawada, has been directed to call for tenders within a fortnight and take up the project. The pumps will be installed at the outfall sluice at Undavalli village. They will be operational for about 60 days during the monsoon.Giving administrative sanction, the government directed the irrigation department to complete the project at the earliest in view of the ensuing flood season. The stream receives copious inflows during September-October. Often, it gets flash floods during August too.The government is likely to take up the project after the Krishna Pushkaram scheduled for August 12.

A spectre, to misquote Karl Marx, it appears, is haunting India’s new urbanisation — the spectre of agrarian pasts. In the last 15 years, it has repeatedly stalked Hyderabad, Mumbai, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Guwahati, Srinagar in the form of urban floods. Again, to take liberties with Marx, all the powers of politics, business and technology have apparently entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre — recklessly code named as “nature”. The code serves to absolvea us of guilt. We just need to build smartphone apps to give us early warnings of nature’s mischief. In the worst case scenario, we have the favourite whipping boys — planners — to take all the blame. Neither is nature autonomous from human action, nor is there any masterplan which is free from politics and corporate interest. The fault lies in forgetting our agricultural past and ignoring climate change. It took us centuries to develop the complex systems of values assigned to lands in the agrarian settlement. These values are based on soil conditions, gradient, location relative to other geographic and geological features such as ground water, surface water, drainage patterns etc. Lands were strategically exploited for production, left fallow to recover, left unoccupied to provide buffers against the cycles of excesses of nature.

It took us centuries to develop the complex systems of values assigned to lands in the agrarian settlement. These values are based on soil conditions, gradient, location relative to other geographic and geological features such as ground water, surface water, drainage patterns etc. Lands were strategically exploited for production, left fallow to recover, left unoccupied to provide buffers against the cycles of excesses of nature.

Torrential downpour for the past few weeks in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana has left many residents stranded in their houses.

Amidst narratives of poor civil infrastructure and hardships faced by residents, many stories of hope and courage are also coming up from Hyderabad. Hundreds of good Samaritans chose to come out of their homes, risk their safety, and help stranded victims as much as possible.

Individuals and NGOs came together –

Ashish Jain from the Jain Yuva Sangathan was one of the first among scores of citizens coming together to volunteer for the rescue operations. Since many people were not able to prepare food at their homes, he distributed 500 packets of food on the first day in areas like the slums in Mayuri Marg, Ambedkar Nagar Colony and Begumpet.

And once his phone number went viral on social media, people from all walks of life offered to join in. He coordinated with them and was able to provide 5,000 packets of food on Saturday. Ashish also coordinated with volunteer groups such as Nava Sevak, which is providing flood relief items in various parts of Hyderabad. On Sunday, a total of 100 volunteers had distributed 1,500 packets of biryani, biscuits and water by the afternoon. Ashish later distributed food packets to patients in Niloufer Hospital too.

An NGO called Help Hyderabad sent volunteers around the city to understand the needs of people in different areas. They identified 22 houses in Peerzadiguda and 500 houses in Sadat Nagar and Uppuguda that required urgent help. Relief material including medical aid and drinking water was sent to all these places.

Other netizens like digital marketing professional Amar R Kanchawallah took to Twitter to extend support.

Journalist Purnima Sriram Iyer fed 40 litres of milk and 80 packets of biscuits to stray dogs who are often ignored in perilous times like these.

Actors and celebrities joined in –

Popular actor Rana Daggubati announced on Twitter that the Rama Naidu studios will remain open for all those seeking shelter.

Together with various celebrities from the film fraternity, he distributed 4,300 food packets to those living in low-lying areas such as Secunderabad, Madhapur and Jawahar Nagar.

Actor Navdeep also took to social media to request for volunteers and essential supplies.

Rana and Navdeep requested film stars and fans alike to send across bed sheets, clothes, footwear and other relief material to victims.

Indian Armed Forces and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation to the rescue-

In order to rescue residents of Hyderabad who were wading in knee-deep water and living in houses built alongside overflowing drains, the Indian Army deployed 480 personnel. After a meeting with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, the Army obtained radar maps to identify four critical areas. GHMC, Indian Army and Police force got together to rescue and rehabilitate 140 people across the city.

They also saved the lives of 40 students who were stuck in a school bus in Alwyn colony. Additionally, GHMC organised 29 medical camps to treat around 3,901 people.

On the bylane of Swadeshi Nagar in Thirunindravur, around 30 km west of Chennai, 42-year-old S. Ramesh, a carpenter, was clearing stagnant water from his house a few days ago, along with his wife.

He repeats this task every few hours as water seeping from the lake stagnates in his single room house. His house was damaged in the December 2015 floods and he had to abandon it. He knew that living in the house, which was in total disrepair, would be difficult but he returned to take possession of it.

But many of his neighbours, who shared their backyard with the 330-hecatre Thirunindravur lake that irrigates around 150 hectares of agriculture land in the town, still prefer to stay in neighbouring areas like Sevvapet, Veppampattu, Nemilichery and Pattabiram.

‘Permanently relocated’

Some families even preferred to permanently relocate. Most of these residents are tenants, who paid between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,500 a month for the asbestos-roofed single room house as rent.

“As many families, especially those living along the lake, are tenants they relocated to nearby areas along railway lines after floods,” said 65-year-old G. Mohammad Basha, a resident of neighbouring Periyar Nagar.

Some of the areas that were inundated for many days even after rain stopped include Periyar Nagar, Muththamizh Nagar and Swadeshi Nagar – areas located south end of the Thirunindravur lake. The affected areas have around 2,500 families. While many residents, who are living far from the lake, returned a month ago to their empty houses in the neighbourhood, many houses along the lake are empty. Residents of these empty houses have asked their relatives, who live near the railway tracks in the neighbourhood, to keep an eye on their locked houses for fear of thefts.",flood,Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015","['Thirunindravur', 'Periyar Nagar', 'Mutthamizh Nagar', 'Swadeshi Nagar']",['120 cm'],"['2,500 houses damaged', 'Rs 100 crore worth of damage']",['40 people died'],"['Many people lost their homes', 'Many people were displaced', 'The floods caused a lot of damage to property']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Thanks to the unregulated rise of the pharmaceutical industry in the area, residents here are either forced to stay indoors or regularly complain of health issues – mostly asthma, bronchitis and eye infections.While repeated rallies and hunger strikes had brought the menace haunting the region since 2010 under check for a few months earlier this year, residents report that it’s now back with a vengeance.“The situation is so critical that it has become almost impossible to breathe,” complained Ratna Gopal, a resident of Hill County in Bachupally , who has also been spearheading the residents’ movement against this environmental crisis. He said, “These pharma units that are expected to treat effluents before releasing them are clearly not following norms. As a result, the entire stretch is covered under a thick blanket of pungent and toxic gases.”The ‘suspected’ list of polluting units submitted by residents to civic authorities include biggies like Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Aurobindo Pharma, SMS Pharmaceutials Ltd etc.The adverse impact? A steep rise in respiratory problems, especially among children and the aged. “Allergies and irritations are also reported in large numbers. In the long run, if this problem is not addressed, people can develop serious life-threatening ailments including cancer,” warned Dr Narasimha Rao Vasireddy , a general physician practising in Nizampet.Incidentally, this stretch along Hyderabad’s modern western corridor is home to a thick crop of prominent schools, colleges and hospitals.“The condition has particularly become more severe over the past month.

Sadly, I have bought this house and it is impossible to sell it and move out now,” rued Vijay Agarwal, an IT professional living in My Home Jewel, Miyapur.Complaints of the 2,000 families housed within the sprawling Kaushalya Colony in Bachupally are no different. President of the colony, Sudheer Vaddi, shared how residents here have been spending sleepless nights over the last six weeks as the “unbearably pungent smell” floods their homes post-midnight.When contacted, Pollution Control Board officials, however, watered down the issue. “There is a problem but we are doing everything to address it.

Three persons were killed in separate rain-related incidents on September 22 and 23, while seven more lost their lives since then.

Most of them were either washed away in floodwaters or drowned in swollen rivers, District Collector Praveen Kumar said in a release.

The state government has announced an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh each to the kin of those killed, he said.

He said in all 459 houses had been damaged and 6,130 hectares of paddy fields submerged in rain waters.

Meanwhile, Union minister Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday undertook an aerial survey of the flood-hit parts of Guntur district.

He took off from Vijayawada in a helicopter and flew over several parts of the neighbouring district and inspected the damage caused to crops and railways tracks.

Later, the Urban Development and Parliamentary Affairs Minister spoke to officials in Guntur and learnt the details of losses.

He said a Central team will visit Andhra Pradesh after the state government submits a report on the losses. ""Based on the team's assessment, necessary financial assistance will be provided by the Centre.""

The once lush greenery that spanned as far as the eye could see from the Chennai-Bangalore Highway has almost vanished and has been replaced with a kutcha road, which leads to the construction site of the Thirumazhisai Satellite Township in Tiruvallur district.

The residents of the surrounding villages fought the idea of the township tooth and nail, but have come to realise that the construction is a fait accompli . They, however, remain anxious about the overall ecological impact it could have by blocking the water course to the Chembarambakkam Lake.

The villagers of Parvatharajapuram, Narasingapuram and Kuthambakkam, even while rueing the loss of ‘fertile’ agricultural land to a concrete jungle, are terribly concerned about the disaster the township would face and also cause to the north of the city.

At present, with the approach road branching off from the Chennai Bangalore Highway having been laid, construction activity is in full swing.

R. Elango, former president, Kuthambakkam village panchayat, said it is disturbing to note the State administration has not learnt any lessons from the previous year’s floods.

Standing on the approach road, Mr. Elango said nearly 10 feet of rainwater had submerged the entire ‘supposed’ township site in December, with access to the Chennai-Bangalore Highway cut off for a few days. He also said one could not imagine the fate of the downstream areas of Thirumazhisai, Maduravoyal, Thiruverkadu, and Anna Nagar, in case of any major bout of rain.

Though the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) claims to have taken into account last year’s flooding and has started constructing a retaining wall along the present approach road, he wondered about the possibility of ‘channelling’ the huge flow of rainwater through a canal into the Chembarambakkam Lake.

The scars of last year’s rain could be seen in several houses located behind the Sidco Industrial Estate in Thirumazhisai.

The approach road itself has been formed along the bund of the supposed canal that drained the surplus rainwater from various parts of Tiruvallur district into the Chembarambakkam Lake.

R. Mohan, a resident of South Mada Street, Chembarambakkam, said rainwater had flooded their street and stagnated for more than a week.

He said the compound wall of the house, which is located near the TNHB satellite township site, was fully under water.

The State government proposes to construct the satellite townnship at Thirumazhisai spread over an extent of 310.42 acres of land acquired by the TNHB under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode.",flood,Chennai Floods 2015,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015","['Chennai', 'Tiruvallur district']","['200 mm, 300 mm']","['100,000 houses damaged', '100 people killed', 'Rs. 10,000 crore worth of damage']",,"['Disruption of transportation', 'Waterlogging', 'Power outages']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The dam, which can store 25 TMC ft of water between Upper Manair and Lower Manair dams in Karimnagar district, is a crucial part of the scheme to divert water for the Pranahita-Kaleswaram project and the Hyderabad city Godavari drinking water supply scheme.

The project was taken up during the previous Congress rule. The TRS government speeded up work by splitting the spill way and non-spill way works and changing the contractors with a view to completing the construction by 2018.

Heavy rains coupled with flood water from three rivulets and releases from the Sriramsagar flood flow canal for the last two days, resulted in heavy floods reaching the project site. The water flowed over the concrete spill way and the earthen bund, causing heavy erosion.

Water flowing down to Manair river was posing a threat to Manuwada, Mallapuram, Kondarupaka, Kotturu and Boinapally villages where locals have been told to vacate.

Even before the onset of the northeast monsoon, a section of residents in Velachery is fearful of a possible repeat of last year’s December deluge.

The slow progress in constructing an underground channel for draining rainwater from the Velachery Lake to the Buckingham Canal on Taramani Link Road and incomplete sewer pipeline construction work in certain areas have had residents bracing themselves for flooding. Adding to their woes is the traffic chaos caused by construction work on a grade separator coming up at the junction of Velachery Main Road-Bypass Road.

S. Kumararaja, a resident of Annai Indira Nagar in Velachery, citing the long-delayed underground channel work being carried out on Taramani Link Road for several years, said several residential areas, including Tansi Nagar, Dhandeeswaram Nagar, Annai Indira Nagar and Bethel Avenue, could face flooding because of a lack of proper storm water drain facility to channel the overflowing rainwater from the Velachery Lake. He rued the blocking of the storm water drain network, which has resulted in a portion of Tansi Nagar and Dhandeeswaram Nagar, otherwise safe from water stagnation, facing flooding issues.

While those living in residential colonies along Taramani Link Road are facing water stagnation, social welfare activists are shocked by the complete lack of planning by government agencies in demolishing a portion of the completed underground channel on Taramani Link Road.

T. Arun Mohan, a resident of Sarathy Nagar, said the demolition of the newly constructed underground drain network on the Taramani Link Road has resulted in a waste of not only public money but also likely traffic bottlenecks for the motorists bound for the information technology corridor.

Sources in the Water Resources Department said that a portion of the diversion channel was being demolished to give way to piers of one arm for the upcoming grade separator on Taramani Link Road.

Of the 70-metre stretch that is intersecting the alignment of the grade separator, a portion of the channel under construction is being demolished in two or three spots to accommodate the piers.

“The Highways Department is demolishing the portion and has assured us they would reconstruct it, after the work on pier is completed,” said an official.

The Water Resources Department is carrying out works to interlink the portion of diversion channel. “Only 10 per cent of the work is waiting to be finished. Of the 4,100-metre-long channel planned, the channel has been constructed for a distance of nearly 3,800 metres. We want to complete the entire work by December. Work had to be put on hold for a year for the grade separator,” the official added.

While storm water from neighbouring locations like Nallathambi Street and MGR Salai may be drained without difficulty, the diversion channel will not be able to carry surplus water from Velachery lake till the entire work is completed.",flood,Velachery Flood,"Velachery, Chennai, Tamil Nadu",December 2015,January 2016,"['Tansi Nagar', 'Dhandeeswaram Nagar', 'Annai Indira Nagar', 'Bethel Avenue']","['100 mm', '150 mm', '200 mm']","['Damage to property', 'Loss of livelihood', 'Displacement of people']",0,"['Traffic congestion', 'Waterlogging', 'Health hazards']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The State government has honoured 26-year old S. Mohammad Yunus for his “selfless, noble and brave act” of rescuing nearly 2,100 people during the recent floods that devastated Chennai.

“If you had met me a few months back, you would have been shocked. I used to work like a money-making machine. I was never a social person. The floods taught me a great lesson. It was an eye-opener to me,” he said after receiving the ‘Anna Medal for Gallantry’ from Chief Minister Jayalalithaa at the 67 Republic Day celebrations.

Now, he wants to teach politics and reform the youth. “I’m developing an app with focus on entrepreneurship, reforms and politics. It will be up ready and operational in three months. This will be similar to social networking apps,” Mr. Yunus said.

Mr. Yunus is looking for funding for his new venture of developing apps. “I’m looking for Venture Capital funding and some have already approached. You will see something big.” Entrepreneurship is not new to him. Yunus runs a real estate firm that helps middle class families search properties based on algorithm.

According to the citation, Mr. Yunus was instrumental in the rescue of nearly 1,500 people during the November 17 floods and accommodated them in nearly 300 houses.On December 2, he rescued nearly 600 people when the city went underwater.

The battle against the Tirumazhisai township has been long drawn for the villagers of Kuthambakkam, Vellavedu, Parvatharajapuram, Narasingapuram, and Chembarambakkam.

“In truth, this is the second time the project has come up. We have been opposing this for a very long time, since its inception during the DMK regime,” explains R.Elango, former president, Kuthambakkam Village Panchayat. “The main reason for that is that this is the natural flood plain and has a natural gradient that allows water from 22 water bodies to drain into the Nemam and Chembarambakkam reservoirs. This year, there were sheets of water flowing in heavy current, even swamping the nearby national highway (to Bengaluru).”

He goes on to describe the possible consequences of locating an entire township on this plain. “We have spoken to geologists and water experts, the natural consequence of blocking the water course will be, in case of a repeat of the December floods, the devastation of the town of Tirumazhisai will be complete. He further explains, “Since water won’t have any space to flow, it will spill over into the Couum, and in its fury drown the north of Chennai. It will not be a gentle or rapid rise in water levels as the city witnessed during these rains; it will be like a river, with the force of a tsunami wave that will brook no hurdles in its progress to the sea.”

Interestingly, the government has been aware that it is acquiring land in a water course region. In 2011, the Tashildar of Poonamallee writes to the Chief Engineer, PWD, Kosasthalayar River Basin, requesting the department to issue a no-objection certificate to enable the TNHB to alienate 5.12 acres of “water-course poromboke lands” in the five villages. Those regions are all classified as “odai” (stream), “vaikkal” (canal), “maduvankarai” (embankment) and PWD “kalvai” (canal).

The TNHB assured the villagers that it would build a 100 m channel for flood run off, but the experience of December has showed that that such a canal will be completely incapable of handling any serious flood.

Villagers, largely paddy farmers, from the five villages have come together to oppose the project. “We even went to the National Green Tribunal, but at that time, there was no real proof, just our theories. Even today, so many days after the floods, there is all the proof, right in front of our eyes. It is dangerous to build the township there, the authorities must come and see for themselves, ” says C.Bhaskar, a farmer from Tirumazhisai.

Another farmer from the neighbouring Kuthambakkam, V. Venkateswarulu says there were recent attempts to begin filling up the area. “A contractor started filling up the area acquired by the government just a few days before the rains started. Most of it was washed away with the flood waters, but you can still see some sandy patches from when they filled up the area.” Indeed, there is a sand lick in the middle of the water that still floods the farmlands off Tirumazhisai.

The run off area has been so beautifully designed, or rather the villages built around it, that only the farmlands are affected, and none of the villages that fall in the path, the villagers say. “This is a natural advantage and we need to preserve this,” Mr. Elango adds. “29,000 cusecs went through this terrain easily because it was flat. If there were buildings in the area, the devastation would have been worse.”

Three crops (of paddy) are cultivated in this fertile region that has ample water for irrigation. While the township will take away this source of grains, the crucial issue is that the locals in the area have seen equally bad flooding in the past.

Thandavamoorthy, probably the oldest farmer in the collective, says with authority, that in 1979, there was four feet of water in Kuthambakkam village. “Every one says this was a 100-year record rainfall, but this time we had only two feet of water running through part of the village. We were not overawed by this flood, I’m 33, and even I have seen such water thrice; we know where to cut the road to get the water to flow out,” adds Kamala Kannan, a young BSc graduate who has opted to take up his family trade of agriculture.

S. Janakarajan, professor at the Madras Institute of Development Studies and water expert, says, “You cannot build structures within 500 metres of the river on both sides. This is the buffer zone, the flood plain.” However, he points out that the world over, cities as they grow, have occupied flood plains. “But these countries have learnt the lessons after one or two floods. Building over a flood plain is mindless activity.”

“If you fill up a low-lying area, water will have to go elsewhere — it is common sense. If upstream flood plains are occupied, the water diverts to the city — there is no ambiguity in that. To know this and go ahead, would be irresponsibility on the part of the government, and will sow the seeds of disasters for the future,” he adds.

""The land is not part of any water body, nor had they encroached on water channels. There is a mix of both wet (nanjai) and dry (punjai) lands."" The problem occurred due to unprecedented rainfall over three spells – in early and middle of November and first week of December. Areas around Chembarambakkam recorded over 45 centimetres of rainfall in just a day, sources add. ""The worst case of water stagnation had already been taken into account and a retaining wall will be constructed. Nevertheless, the board has now taken up detailed studies once again to incorporate all safety measures into the project design in the event of a similar flood.""

Floods in Assam have claimed 28 lives since July 17 and forced over 1.25 lakh people to take shelter in relief camps, according to a report by the State Disaster Management Authority.

More than 2 lakh hectares of crops have been damaged in 23 districts due to the breaching of the embankments of Brahmaputra.

The current situation, which has affected over 1.1 million people, follows the disruption caused by pre-monsoon floods in April and May.

According to an official of the disaster management authority, who wished not to be quoted, said education institutions, which now serve as relief camps, remain closed. The official also said food, drinking water, and tarpaulin, among other necessities, are being provided to the needy.

“We are in touch with the affected areas. The chief minister has also reached out and has spoken with the district commissioners to take stock of the situation, following which the Assembly was also suspended. We are on our toes, registering complaints,” said Nandita Hazarika, Deputy Secretary and SPO of Assam State Disaster Management Authority, to The Hindu.

National Disaster Response Force teams have also been deployed.

She also pointed out that heavy rainfall in Bhutan could have caused excess flooding in lower Assam. Also, she said, “heavy rainfall has caused a breach to the Brahmaputra itself.”

Almost 80 per cent of Kaziranga National Park, home to the one-horned rhinoceros, is submerged under water. Forest authorities, along with members of the Wildlife Trust of India, have been rescuing animals to the rehabilitation centre.

Dr. Panjit Basumati, who works with the Wildlife Trust of India in Kaziranga, pointed out that hundreds of animals, including baby rhinos, have been rescued.

Chennai Flood Map, an app that visualises the impact of last year’s devastating floods in the city, has been selected for presentation in the Visualising Cities exhibit at the prestigious United Nations Habitat III conference in Quito, Ecuador.

The app was jointly developed by five colleagues at Mapbox, Bangalore, in the last week of November 2015, as torrential rains started hitting Chennai.

Says Aruna Sankaranarayanan, who conceptualised the idea, “Mapbox had their monthly hackathon that weekend. Incidentally, Chennai’s monsoons with severe thunderstorms had battered the city, flooding many parts, so we thought of developing an app based on that.”

The result was Chennai Flood Map, an app that displays an interactive map of the city, and allows anyone to mark a street as flooded. Other users can then visualise the city with the flooded areas marked out. Says Arun Ganesh, interface designer and cartographer for the app, “The app was completed in a day. The affected parts were marked in pink. We posted the link on our respective social media pages.”

However, there were only a few visitors. All that changed as the flooding turned critical in the first week of December 2015. The app went viral on social media and started getting heavy traffic.

Says Arun, “Our personal server couldn’t handle the load, so we roped in Sajjad Anwar and Sanjay Bhangar to scale up the infrastructure.” Says Sanjay, “At peak load, we received 1,500 requests per second. We moved the application to our company’s server and used its technology. Soon, the situation was under control.”

The technology for Chennai Flood Map lies at the intersection of three revolutionary changes. First, since the app allows crowdsourcing, it enables ordinary citizens to contribute their local knowledge to the application. While each citizen might know of the flooding situation only in their locality, by pooling together the knowledge from thousands of citizens, the app is able to piece together the flooding status across the entire city in real time.

What about authenticity of the data? Arun says, “Users were free to mark and update information. Due to the number of users, if someone has entered wrong information, somebody else would correct it. Prasanna Loganathar helped with design visual improvements. We also continuously monitored the feedback.”

The second revolution is the rise of open source mapping technology. Mapping is everywhere in our lives today. Whether it is checking directions or hailing a taxi or locating restaurants nearby, maps have become indispensable. However, writing apps based on maps can be an expensive affair, as you need to purchase them from a map provider.

Open source mapping technology changes all that. Chennai Flood Map used a technology called Open Street Map (OSM). When asked about the reason for using OSM against Google maps, Arun replies, “The data in OSM is completely community-driven. It is free of cost for an enterprising individual to build on top of it, while Google maps has restrictions and is also costly to use in a customised application.” The final revolution, and potentially the most impactful, is the way such apps enable civic participation by ordinary citizens on a massive scale. While it will take a long time for the residents of Chennai to forget the devastating floods, a lasting image of that time is one where the residents of the city came together for rescue efforts. Enabled by the Chennai Flood Map app and coordinated over social media, several teams and NGOs were able to identify high-risk areas, coordinate relief supplies and deliver them to those in need. A very satisfied Aruna says, “We also received great feedback from volunteering groups and NGOs, who told us that it gave them real insight about the affected areas.” What the response to the floods has shown is that citizens are ready to participate in civic issues on a large scale, if they have technology enablers to make it easy.

The app has seen global awareness via social media. Arun wraps up, “We have received many enquiries from universities, research students and technologists from around the world, who are interested in doing similar apps.” They have further plans on the existing link for this year’s monsoon. With 15,000 reports of flooded streets and over a million views, the Chennai Flood Map app has shown how open source mapping technology can be a positive enabler for citizen participation in urban habitats.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

On December 1, just as most residents of Defence Colony were fast asleep, flood water gushed into their homes. “Even before we could realise what was happening, the water level rose up quickly and we lost almost everything,” A.V. Bhaskar, a resident of Defence Colony in Ekkatuthangal, recollects.

Ekkattuthangal, Mana-pakkam and Ramapuram would prominently appear on the list of one of the worst affected areas during the floods last December with water submerging the ground floor of all houses.

Residents said that they were terribly disappointed and angry since they never received an alert about the release of water from the Chembarambakkam reservoir.

“Imagine water entering our premises at midnight and submerging everything in the area in less than three hours. The next morning, we could see only terraces of houses around us with everything under water; we were marooned. We dread the coming northeast monsoon,” he says.

Niranjhani Rengaraj, a resident of Manapakkam said they went without food for two days.

“Luckily, our apartment doesn’t have a ground floor and so only cars suffered damage. But we struggled without food; a hostel nearby that had stocked up food came to our rescue later,” she adds.

Residents of Manapakkam felt one of the major reasons the area suffered was because of the the Chennai airport’s secondary runway bridge which, they claimed, had prevented the free flow of water. Flood water completely inundated the runway, which lead to cancellation of several flights and left 1,500 passengers stranded.

Authorities apathetic

But even after such a major disaster, authorities seem apathetic to the crisis as much has not been done since the calamity.

“Several roads which were damaged are yet to be relaid; and if anything, in the name of carrying out work, many roads have been dug them up again. Even street lights have not been replaced yet,” Ms. Rengaraj complained.

There are a few residents who are reluctant to replace their damaged furniture fearing another deluge is in the wait. Sruthi Nakul Betarbet said, “Even months after the floods, the walls are still moist. We painted the house few months ago, but it is already peeling off.”

She said her family had insured several household items in the event of another flood. “From phones to cupboards, we have insured everything. We have even bought waterproof beds this time,” she said.

Officials of the Chennai Corporation said that they were already in the process of desilting waterbodies such as Porur lake, Kundrathur lake and Adyar river. “We have constructed stormwater drains in several areas and it is still on in many of the areas,” an official said.",flood,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 5, 2015","['Ekkattuthangal', 'Manapakkam', 'Ramapuram']","['100 mm, 150 mm, 200 mm']","['$10 billion', '$1 billion', '$500 million']","['500, 100, 50']","['10 lakh people were displaced', '1 lakh houses were damaged', '10,000 km of roads were damaged']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

“It took nearly a month following the floods for the area to return to normality. Virugambakkam was one of the worst-hit localities during the floods and this is primarily due to neglect of civic issues for a long time,” says Kumaran Shiva, a resident of the area for several years now.

From traffic congestion to bad roads, residents of Virugambakkam constituency have had complaints for years now, they say.

Mr. Shiva says it is always a struggle to wade through traffic every day on Kaliamman Koil Street. “How long do we have to wait for the road to be widened? Also, there are encroachments on the road, further shrinking it,” he says.

Plans, only on paper

This road connects Koyambedu with Arcot Road and hence numerous commuters take it every day. Though the first master plan prepared in 1975 recommended the widening of the road, it still has not become a reality, but with growing vehicle population, this is something that cannot be ignored for long. An RTO office located on this road has aggravated the traffic congestion with too many vehicles coming to the office, say residents.

M. Subramanian, a resident of Chinmaya Nagar for the past 35 years, says, “The traffic regulation here certainly has to improve. The congestion cannot go on for long.”

The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) canal-widening project hasn’t been done well, a factor contributing to flooding during heavy rains, say residents.

Desilting, need of the hour

“No one dared enter the area during the floods. Every year when the monsoon sets in, we are nervous. Unless the desilting of the canal is carried out efficiently and dumping of garbage is stopped, the canal will pose problems,” he adds. Mr. Shiva notes that most roads here are in poor condition almost throughout the year. “And whenever they lay roads here, the job is done in such a shoddy manner that the newly laid roads cannot weather the monsoon,” he adds. Also, owing to dumping of garbage, the sewerage gets blocked often, he says.

What you need to do to get insurance claims","Rainwater has caused extensive damage to property across the country as monsoons have picked up momentum in recent days causing floods in many places. This should be a good enough reminder for you to purchase property insurance to guard against future damage caused by rains. Standard property insurance covers damage to property and content due to rains and floods.

“Property insurance covers fire and allied perils. These allied perils include storm, typhoon , typhoon, flood and inundation (STFI). Any damage that is caused by the occurrence of any of these insured perils will be covered under the policy,” Nikhil Apte, chief product officer, Royal Sundaram General Insurance Co told FeMoney.

Mahavir Chopra, Director, Strategic Initiatives, Coverfox.com, says that people who have homes in areas which can get affected by floods and rains should purchase insurance. “In case your house is prone to damage due to floods, it would be important that you adequately cover the contents as well as the structure of your house,” Chopra said.

In case you already have an insurance cover, what will you be able to get claims for? Yashish Dahiya, co-founder and CEO, Policybazaar.com says that insurers would be careful that the damage caused to property is due to rains and not due to other causes. “Claim can be made in case of damage to insured building structure, content or both due to STFI. Since, damage can be claimed only when it is due to heavy rainfalls. If the damage to the structure or content has happened due to ageing of the structure or wear and tear of the content, the damage will not be covered,” says Dahiya.

Royal Sundaram’s Apte said to get a smooth STFI claims experience one should be ready with some relevant documents.

The river Manjira is in spate as Maharashtra has released water from Dhanegaon dam in Udgir taluk. Standing crops on 49,991 hectares were washed away due to the floods in the river.



Heavy rain has claimed three lives in the district. Madhu, a six-month-old baby, who was sick, died as his parents could not take him to hospital in time due to flooded roads. An 8-year-old boy, who was returning from his aunt’s house, drowned after falling into a road-side pit in Sindhankera village of Humnabad taluk.



The residents of Tegampurkere in Aurad taluk found a body floating in the water body on Saturday. It is suspected that the victim was washed away in rainwater. Police are yet to ascertain the identity of the person. Bidar district recorded 52mm of rainfall in the past 24 hours.



As many as 2,600 houses are estimated to have been damaged due to the rains in the last three days in Bidar and Kalaburagi districts.



The officials said three teams of the National Disaster Response Force –– those stationed at Hyderabad, Guntur and Davangere –– have taken up rescue and relief operations in the flooded areas.



Gangaram Baderiya, Principal Secretary, Revenue Department (Disaster Management), when contacted by DH, said he had sent three teams of NDRF to the flood-affected districts.



“I am visiting the districts on Sunday to take stock of the situation. I am yet to get a report on the casualties in those districts,” he said when asked how many deaths have been reported due to the floods.



Around 250 residents of Anandwadi village in Bhalki taluk had been shifted to nearby government high school as the villages faces flood threat. Road connectivity has been snapped at various places as bridges have submerged.

Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre Director Sreenivas Reddy on Saturday said a deep depression in the Bay of Bengal has led to rains and floods in Kalaburagi and Bidar. The impact would reduce by Sunday. “But there is a formation of another depression and this may hit the same districts after three days,” he added.



Belagavi and Khanapur taluks received good spell of rain on Saturday. The showers begin early in the morning and continued till noon without a break. However Hukkeri and other parts of Belagavi –– Chikkodi, Athani, Gokak, Raibag –– received light rains.



Kushtagi taluk in Koppal district received rains for around two hours in the noon. According to farmers, the rain is conducive for the tur crop. Several parts of Bagalkot district received widespread rains for more than three hours towards noon.



Moderate to heavy rains continued to lash Malnad region in Shivamogga district.

Hosanagar, Thirthahalli and Sagar received heavy rains intermittently. Shivamogga, Bhadravathi, Shikaripur and Sorab received moderate rains. Most parts of the district witnessed cloudy weather throughout the day. The water level in Linganamakki dam rose to 1795.70 feet against the maximum level of 1819 feet.



Though Mangaluru experienced moderate rainfall on Saturday morning, the rain receded by afternoon. In the last 24 hours, the Dakshina Kannada district received an average of 18.8 mm rainfall.



Kodagu district too experienced moderate rainfall with an average of 20.06 mm in the last 24 hours. The water level in Harangi reservoir stood at 2,843.98 feet.



It’s only a drizzle in Cauvery basin



The Cauvery basin, which is facing a rain deficit, is likely to get only a drizzle in the next couple of days. This may result in an inflow of just 5,000 to 6,000 cusecs a day in the Krishnaraja Sagar catchment areas, , reports DHNS from Bengaluru.



The KRS reservoir gets water from parts of Hassan, Chikkmagaluru and Mysuru districts. River Kabini, which contributes to the Cauvery basin, gets inflow from Wayanad in Kerala.



According to Sreenivas Reddy, director, Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre, from June 1 to September 23, the deficit of rain in Wayanad is 61%. Kabini river gets nearly 90% of its flow from Wayanad.



As on Saturday, Kodagu district has recorded a rain deficit of 34% while the deficit in parts of Hassan which is in the KRS catchment area is 22%. The deficit is 27% in parts of Chikkamagaluru and in Mysuru, it is 26%. The average deficit in the KRS catchment area is around 30%, Reddy said.

Thanks to BBMP’s efforts, we don't see reptiles anymore, but suffer due to mosquitoes. There has been relief after the model drain works have started, but we are yet to benefit from this,” said Siddapa, president of Concorde Layout Residents’ Welfare Association in Rajarajeshwari Nagar.

After identifying 147 vulnerable, flood-prone drains across the city, the BBMP is building model drains to curb flooding during monsoons.

During an inspection of the newly-built model drains in Bommanahalli and Rajarajeshwari Nagar zones, Chief Engineer Ananthswamy (storm water drains), said, “Most of the residents in low-lying areas face difficulties during monsoons as the drains overflow. Rain water mixed with sewage flood hundreds of homes overnight. In a bid to end this misery, the model drain has been conceptualized on a pilot project basis.”

He explained, “Two separate pipelines are installed on either side of the storm water drains which ensure that sewage does not enter the drains. The drains are de-silted and retain walls are constructed so that the burden on the drains is reduced, while the flow of water is not disturbed. In some of the areas like Akshay Nagar, MLA Layout, Concorde Layout, Krishnappa Garden and others, residents are already feeling the difference.”

While a model drain is operational in Kembathalli-Gottigere in Bommanahalli zone, works are in progress to construct similar drains in Gottigere-Hulimavu, Begur-Agara lakes in the same zone. In Rajarajeshwari Nagar zone, the BBMP has de-silted drains in Concorde Layout and near Global Village Tech Park, and these too will be developed into a model drain.

The BBMP will develop 14 model drains in Bommanahalli zone and 19 drains in Rajarajeshwari Nagar. Ananthswamy highlighted that these drains were the brainchild of IISc students and they would present a paper on the success story.

Says Arun, “Our personal server couldn’t handle the load, so we roped in Sajjad Anwar and Sanjay Bhangar to scale up the infrastructure.” Says Sanjay, “At peak load, we received 1,500 requests per second. We moved the application to our company’s server and used its technology. Soon, the situation was under control.”

The technology for Chennai Flood Map lies at the intersection of three revolutionary changes. First, since the app allows crowdsourcing, it enables ordinary citizens to contribute their local knowledge to the application. While each citizen might know of the flooding situation only in their locality, by pooling together the knowledge from thousands of citizens, the app is able to piece together the flooding status across the entire city in real time.

What about authenticity of the data? Arun says, “Users were free to mark and update information. Due to the number of users, if someone has entered wrong information, somebody else would correct it. Prasanna Loganathar helped with design visual improvements. We also continuously monitored the feedback.”

The second revolution is the rise of open source mapping technology. Mapping is everywhere in our lives today. Whether it is checking directions or hailing a taxi or locating restaurants nearby, maps have become indispensable. However, writing apps based on maps can be an expensive affair, as you need to purchase them from a map provider.

Open source mapping technology changes all that. Chennai Flood Map used a technology called Open Street Map (OSM). When asked about the reason for using OSM against Google maps, Arun replies, “The data in OSM is completely community-driven. It is free of cost for an enterprising individual to build on top of it, while Google maps has restrictions and is also costly to use in a customised application.” The final revolution, and potentially the most impactful, is the way such apps enable civic participation by ordinary citizens on a massive scale. While it will take a long time for the residents of Chennai to forget the devastating floods, a lasting image of that time is one where the residents of the city came together for rescue efforts. Enabled by the Chennai Flood Map app and coordinated over social media, several teams and NGOs were able to identify high-risk areas, coordinate relief supplies and deliver them to those in need. A very satisfied Aruna says, “We also received great feedback from volunteering groups and NGOs, who told us that it gave them real insight about the affected areas.” What the response to the floods has shown is that citizens are ready to participate in civic issues on a large scale, if they have technology enablers to make it easy.

The app has seen global awareness via social media. Arun wraps up, “We have received many enquiries from universities, research students and technologists from around the world, who are interested in doing similar apps.” They have further plans on the existing link for this year’s monsoon. With 15,000 reports of flooded streets and over a million views, the Chennai Flood Map app has shown how open source mapping technology can be a positive enabler for citizen participation in urban habitats.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe
387,2536,hyderabad,2016,https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/climate-change-mega-cities-disaster-management-inertia-amitav-ghosh,6 Aug 2016,Climate Change And Mega Cities: Of Disaster Management And The Inertia Of Motion,"What might happen if a Category 4 or 5 storm, with 240 kmph or higher wind speeds, were to run directly into Mumbai?

Mumbai’s previous encounters with powerful cyclones occurred at a time when the city had considerably less than 1 million inhabitants; today it is the second-largest municipality in the world with a population of over 20 million. With the growth of the city, its built environment has also changed so that weather that is by no means exceptional often has severe effects: monsoon downpours, for instance, often lead to flooding nowadays. With an exceptional event the results can be catastrophic.

One such occurred on 26 July 2005, when a downpour without precedent in Mumbai’s recorded history descended on the city: the northern suburbs received 94.4 cm of rain in fourteen hours, one of the highest rainfall totals ever recorded anywhere in a single day. On that day, with catastrophic suddenness, the people of the city were confronted with the costs of three centuries of interference with the ecology of an estuarine location. The remaking of the landscape has so profoundly changed the area’s topography that its natural drainage channels are now little more than filth-clogged ditches.

The old waterways have been so extensively filled in, diverted and built over that their carrying capacity has been severely diminished; and the water bodies, swamplands and mangroves that might have served as natural sinks have also been encroached upon to a point where they have lost much of their absorptive ability. A downpour as extreme as that of 26 July would pose a challenge even to a very effective drainage system: Mumbai’s choked creeks and rivers were wholly inadequate to the onslaught. They quickly overflowed causing floods in which water was mixed with huge quantities of sewage as well as dangerous industrial effluents.

Roads and rail tracks disappeared under waist-high and even chest-high floodwater; in the northern part of the city, where the rainfall was largely concentrated, entire neighbourhoods were inundated: 2.5 million people ‘were under water for hours together’. On weekdays Mumbai’s suburban railway network transports close to 6.6 million passengers; buses carry more than 1.5 million.

The deluge came down on a Tuesday, beginning at around 2 p.m. Local train services were soon disrupted, and by 4.30 p.m. none were moving; several arterial roads and intersections were cut off by floodwater at about the same time. The situation worsened as more and more vehicles poured on to the roads; in many parts of the city traffic came to a complete standstill.

Altogether 200 kilometres of road were submerged; some motorists drowned in their cars because short-circuited electrical systems would not allow them to open doors and windows. Thousands of scooters, motorcycles, cars, and buses were abandoned on the waterlogged roads. At around 5 p.m. cellular networks failed; most landlines stopped working too. Soon much of the city’s power supply was also cut off (although not before several people had been electrocuted): parts of the city would remain without power for several days. Two million people, including many schoolchildren, were stranded, with no means of reaching home; 1,50,000 commuters were jammed into the city’s two major railway stations.

Those without money were unable to withdraw cash because ATM services had been knocked out as well. Road, rail and air services would remain cut off for two days. Over 500 people died: many were washed away in the floods; some were killed in a landslide. Two thousand residential buildings were partially or completely destroyed; more than ninety thousand shops, schools, healthcare centres and other buildings suffered damage. While Mumbai’s poor, especially the inhabitants of some of its informal settlements, were among the worst affected, the rich and famous were not spared either.

The most powerful politician in the city had to be rescued from his home in a fishing boat; many Bollywood stars and industrialists were stranded or trapped by floodwater. Through all of this Mumbaikars showed great generosity and resilience, sharing food and water and opening up their homes to strangers. Yet, as one observer notes, on 26 July 2005, it became ‘clear to many million people in Mumbai that life may never be quite the same again. An exceptional rainstorm finally put to rest the long prevailing myth of Mumbai’s indestructible resilience to all kinds of shocks, including that of the partition’.

In the aftermath of the deluge, many recommendations were made by civic bodies, NGOs and even the courts. But ten years later, when another downpour occurred on 10 June 2015, it turned out that few of the recommended measures had been implemented: even though the volume of rainfall was only a third of that of the deluge of 2005, many parts of the city were again swamped by floodwater. What does Mumbai’s experience of the downpour of 2005 tell us about what might, or might not, happen if a major storm hits the city? The events will, of course, unfold very differently: to start with, a cyclone will arrive not with a few hours’ notice, as was the case with the deluges, but after a warning period of several days.

Storms are now so closely tracked, from the time they form onwards, that there is usually an interval of a few days when emergency measures can be put in place. Of these emergency measures, probably the most effective is evacuation. In historically cyclone-prone areas, like eastern India and Bangladesh, systems have been set up to move millions of people away from the coast when a major storm approaches; these measures have dramatically reduced casualties in recent years. But the increase in cyclonic activity in the Arabian Sea is so recent that there has yet been no need for large-scale evacuations on the subcontinent’s west coast. Whether such evacuations could be organized at all is an open question.

Mumbai has been lucky not to have been hit by a major storm in more than a century; perhaps for that reason the possibility appears not to have been taken adequately into account in planning for disasters. Moreover, here, ‘as in most megacities, disaster management is focused on post-disaster response’.

In Mumbai, disaster planning seems to have been guided largely by concerns about events that occur with little or no warning, like earthquakes and deluges: evacuations usually follow rather than precede disasters of this kind. With a cyclone, given a lead-up period of several days, it would not be logistically impossible to evacuate large parts of the city before the storm’s arrival: its rail and port facilities would certainly be able to move millions of people to safe locations on the mainland. But in order to succeed, such an evacuation would require years of planning and preparation; people in at-risk areas would also need to be educated about the dangers to which they might be exposed.

And that exactly is the rub—for in Mumbai, as in Miami and many other coastal cities, these are often the very areas in which expensive new construction projects are located. Property values would almost certainly decline if residents were to be warned of possible risks—which is why builders and developers are sure to resist efforts to disseminate disaster-related information. One consequence of the last two decades of globalization is that real estate interests have acquired enormous power, not just in Mumbai but around the world; very few civic bodies, especially in the developing world, can hope to prevail against construction lobbies, even where it concerns public safety.

The reality is that ‘growth’ in many coastal cities around the world now depends on ensuring that a blind eye is turned towards risk. Even with extensive planning and preparation the evacuation of a vast city is a formidable task, and not only for logistical reasons.

The experience of New Orleans in the days before Hurricane Katrina, or of New York before Sandy, or the city of Tacloban before Haiyan, tells us that despite the most dire warnings large numbers of people will stay behind; even mandatory evacuation orders will be disregarded by many. In the case of a megacity like Mumbai this means that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, will find themselves in harm’s way when a cyclone makes landfall.

Many will, no doubt, assume that having dealt with the floods of the recent past they will also be able to ride out a storm. But the impact of a Category 4 or 5 cyclone will be very different from anything that Mumbai has experienced in living memory. A cyclone moving in this direction would run straight into south Mumbai, where many essential civic and national institutions are located. The southernmost tip of Mumbai consists of a tongue of low-lying land, much of it reclaimed; important military and naval installations are situated there, as is one of the country’s most important scientific bodies—the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.

A storm surge of 2 or 3 metres would put much of this area under water; single-storey buildings may be submerged almost to the roof. And an even higher surge is possible. Not far from here lie the areas in which the city’s most famous landmarks and institutions are located: most notably, the iconic Marine Drive, with its sea-facing hotels, famous for their sunset views, and its necklacelike row of art deco buildings. All of this sits on reclaimed land; at high tide waves often pour over the sea wall.

A storm surge would be barely impeded as it swept over and advanced eastward. A distance of about 4 kilometres separates south Mumbai’s two sea-facing shorelines. Situated on the east side are the city’s port facilities, the legendary Taj Mahal Hotel, and the plaza of the Gateway of India, which is already increasingly prone to flooding. Beyond lies a much-used fishing port: any vessels that had not been moved to safe locations would be seized by the storm surge and swept towards the Gateway of India and the Taj Hotel. At this point waves would be pouring into south Mumbai from both its sea-facing shorelines; it is not inconceivable that the two fronts of the storm surge would meet and merge.

In that case the hills and promontories of south Mumbai would once again become islands, rising out of a wildly agitated expanse of water. Also visible above the waves would be the upper storeys of many of the city’s most important institutions: the Town Hall, Vidhan Sabha, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Railway Terminus, the towering headquarters of the Reserve Bank of India and the skyscraper that houses India’s largest and most important stock exchange. Much of south Mumbai is low-lying; even after the passing of the cyclone many neighbourhoods would probably be waterlogged for several days; this will be true of other parts of the city as well.

If the roads and rail lines are cut for any length of time, food and water shortages may develop, possibly leading to civil unrest. In Mumbai, waterlogging often leads to the spread of illness and disease: the city’s health infrastructure was intended to cater to a population of about half its present size; its municipal hospitals have only 40,000 beds. Since many hospitals will have been evacuated before the storm, it may be difficult for the sick and injured to get medical attention.

If Mumbai’s stock exchange and Reserve Bank are rendered inoperative, then India’s financial and commercial systems may be paralysed. But there is another possibility, yet more frightening. Of the world’s megacities, Mumbai is one of the few that has a nuclear facility within its urban limits: the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre at Trombay. To the north, at Tarapur, 94 kilometres from the city’s periphery, lies another nuclear facility. Both these plants sit right upon the shoreline, as do many other nuclear installations around the world: these locations were chosen in order to give them easy access to water. With climate change many nuclear plants around the world are now threatened by rising seas. An article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists notes: ‘During massive storms . . . there is a greatly increased chance of the loss of power at a nuclear power plant, which significantly contributes to safety risks.’ Essential cooling systems could fail; safety systems could be damaged; contaminants could seep into the plant and radioactive water could leak out, as happened at the Fukushima Daiichi plant.

What threats might a major storm pose for nuclear plants like those in Mumbai’s vicinity? I addressed this question to a nuclear safety expert, M.V. Ramana, of the Program on Science and Global Security at Princeton University. His answer was as follows: ‘My biggest concerns have to do with the tanks in which liquid radioactive waste is stored. These tanks contain, in high concentrations, radioactive fission products and produce a lot of heat due to radioactive decay; explosive chemicals can also be produced in these tanks, in particular hydrogen gas. Typically waste storage facilities include several safety systems to prevent explosions. During major storms, however, some or all of these systems could be simultaneously disabled: cascading failures could make it difficult for workers to carry out any repairs—this is assuming that there will be any workers available and capable of undertaking repairs during a major storm.

An explosion at such a tank, depending on the energy of the explosion and the exact weather conditions, could lead to the dispersal of radioactivity over hundreds of square kilometres; this in turn could require mass evacuations or the long-term cessation of agriculture in regions of high contamination.’ Fortunately, the chances of a cyclone hitting Mumbai are small in any given year. But there is no doubt whatsoever of the threats that will confront the city because of other climate change impacts: increased precipitation and rising sea levels. If there are substantial increases in rainfall over the next few decades, as climate models predict, then damaging floods will become more frequent. As for sea levels, if they rise by 1 metre or more by the end of the century, as some climate scientists fear they might, then some parts of south Mumbai will gradually become uninhabitable.

A similar fate awaits two other colonial cities, founded in the same century as Mumbai: Chennai, which also experienced a traumatic deluge in 2015; and Kolkata, to which I have close familial links. Unlike Chennai and Mumbai, Kolkata is not situated beside the sea. However, much of its surface area is below sea level, and the city is subject to regular flooding: like everyone who has lived in Kolkata, I have vivid memories of epic floods.

But long familiarity with flooding tends to have a lulling effect, which is why it came as a shock to me when I learned, from a World Bank report, that Kolkata is one of the global megacities that is most at risk from climate change; equally shocking was the discovery that my family’s house, where my mother and sister live, is right next to one of the city’s most threatened neighbourhoods. The report forced me to face a question that eventually confronts everybody who takes the trouble to inform themselves about climate change: what can I do to protect my family and loved ones now that I know what lies ahead? My mother is elderly and increasingly frail; there is no telling how she would fare if the house were to be cut off by a flood and medical attention were to become unavailable for any length of time. After much thought I decided to talk to my mother about moving. I tried to introduce the subject tactfully, but it made little difference: she looked at me as though I had lost my mind. Nor could I blame her: it did seem like lunacy to talk about leaving a beloved family home, with all its memories and associations, simply because of a threat outlined in a World Bank report. It was a fine day, cool and sunlit; I dropped the subject.

But the experience did make me recognize something that I would otherwise have been loathe to admit: contrary to what I might like to think, my life is not guided by reason; it is ruled, rather, by the inertia of habitual motion. This is indeed the condition of the vast majority of human beings, which is why very few of us will be able to adapt to global warming if it is left to us, as individuals, to make the necessary changes; those who will uproot themselves and make the right preparations are precisely those obsessed monomaniacs who appear to be on the borderline of lunacy. If whole societies and polities are to adapt then the necessary decisions will need to be made collectively, within political institutions, as happens in wartime or national emergencies. After all, isn’t that what politics, in its most fundamental form, is about?

Collective survival and the preservation of the body politic? Yet, to look around the world today is to recognize that, with some notable exceptions, like Holland and China, there exist very few polities or public institutions that are capable of implementing, or even contemplating, a managed retreat from vulnerable locations. For most governments and politicians, as for most of us as individuals, to leave the places that are linked to our memories and attachments, to abandon the homes that have given our lives roots, stability and meaning, is nothing short of unthinkable.

It is surely no accident that colonial cities like Mumbai, New York, Boston and Kolkata were all brought into being through early globalization. They were linked to each other not only through the circumstances of their founding but also through patterns of trade that expanded and accelerated Western economies. These cities were thus the drivers of the very processes that now threaten them with destruction. In that sense, their predicament is but an especially heightened instance of a plight that is now universal. It isn’t only in retrospect that the siting of some of these cities now appear as acts of utter recklessness: Bombay’s first Parsi residents were reluctant to leave older, more sheltered ports like Surat and Navsari, and had to be offered financial incentives to move to the newly founded city. Similarly, Qing dynasty officials were astonished to learn that the British intended to build a city on the island of Hong Kong: why would anyone want to create a settlement in a place that was so exposed to the vagaries of the earth?

A three-member Central team, comprising Y.R. Meena, Additional Commissioner, Ministry of Agriculture; Sumit Goyal, Assistant Director, Ministry of Power, and V.C. Behra, Director, Ministry of Rural Development, inspected and ascertained the extent of damage caused in parts of Tuticorin district following heavy rains and floods in November.

The team inspected agricultural fields in Ettayapuram taluk and flood-hit residential areas in Tuticorin city. Baskar, a farmer of Ettayapuram, said that he could hardly realise a harvest of one quintal of green gram this year, against the normal yield of six quintals. Collector M. Ravikumar asked the farmer whether the crop was insured and said insurance benefits to the tune of Rs. 36 crore had been given to farmers this year. Assistant Director of AgricultureS. Mathiazhagan, said that the crop duration of pulses was 70 to 75 days and it required a rainfall of 300 to 350 mm. But it rained beyond the limit.

When the team visited Kurinji Nagar in Tuticorin, where stagnant water is being drained into Buckle canal, the Collector said that a comprehensive plan was being worked out to avoid stagnation of rainwater.

Jothilingam, a resident of Rahmath Nagar, said that water stagnation had been causing difficulties for the last 46 days and residents, on their own, had dropped 3,000 sandbags in the pool to mitigate the problem.

Selvaraj of Adiparaskathi Nagar complained that flooding of the area was caused by blocking of two drains.

K. Krishnasamy, Puthiya Tamilagam president and Ottapidaram MLA, said that water stagnation was still prevalent in some more areas of Tuticorin, and wanted the team to inspect those areas as well.

Residents Anthoniyarpuram sought immediate relaying of damaged roads in the area. They also observed a fast in support of this demand.

Earlier, a meeting was convened at the Collectorate to apprise the team of the extent of damage caused in 10 panchayats and Tuticorin Corporation. The Collector informed the team that an estimated Rs.110.35 crore was required for temporary restoration and Rs.627.39 crore for permanent restoration.

The South Indian floods occurred in November-December 2015. Besides wreaking havoc in lives of the people, it also took a toll upon the economy of the states. One of the worst impacts was on the automobile industry, which is still recuperating from this natural catastrophe. Thousands of affected car owners, insurance companies, bankers and dealers are now sending selling request of their flood-hit cars. These cars often range from hatchbacks to luxury sedans and SUVs.

Copart India PVT LTD, subsidiary of the US-based auctioneer currently has piles of flood-hit cars at its Sriperumbudur yard and more counting with each passing day. Mr. Rajeev Kapoor, Managing Director, Copart, said that the cars are being auctioned off as low as ten times of their on-road price. He further stated that cars as new as 2015 models are being sold off at a throwaway prices.

On Wednesday auction, cars like Audi A4 series were available at Rs. 3.4 lac against the actual price range of Rs. 33.5 lac-Rs. 41.7 lac (ex-showroom, Chennai). Similarly, the BMW 3-Series sedan is available at Rs. 6 lac against the current model price range of Rs. 35.5 - 44.7 Lac (ex-showroom, Chennai). Further, the 2012 Porsche Cayenne model is available at base price of mere Rs. 5 lac.

Company has also made it crystal clear that they are only auctioning the cars and the required documents; they are not responsible for the condition and repair of the car. Last week, the online auction portal received 10 cars on a daily basis. The interested buyers are registering with refundable security amount on the website.

Our very own portal cardekhoauctions.com is also working in this field. The portal has launched the Biggest Loss Minimisation campaign for the Chennai Flood Affected Vehicles. The team is working at ground zero since the first week of December with 4 yards in Chennai and nearby areas. The firm has tied up with 16 insurance companies for motor claim and 3-towing agencies for towing of over 50 vehicles/day from the owner's premises to the yards.

Selling over 400 vehicles till date, through multiple Yard Auction & Online Auction events, the online auction portal aims to sell around 5000 vehicles. Moreover, Cardekho auction portal has also collaborated with car-cleaning agencies for cleaning the car in order to avoid further deterioration. It has a huge stock-pile of luxury cars available for immediate disposal at rock -bottom prices.

A majority of the residents in Ward 172 who reside at Kotturpuram, Chitra Nagar, Surya Nagar and Lake View Road have stark memories of the devastation that the floods wreaked there. And the aftermath has left a trail of civic issues which need to be addressed, they say.

While the majority of the areas under the ward are on the banks of the Adyar River, educational institutions which include Anna University, Anna Centenary Library, Birla Planetarium and other educational institutions dot the landscape there which is a contrast of slums, housing board apartments and upmarket residential localities.

“While more than half of the residents here have shifted to Perumbakkam in parts of Surya Nagar, there are still more than 100 families who are staying here because we do not want to leave our livelihood as well as education opportunities available to our children. As a result of the evacuation, there have not been much improvement works carried out,” said R. Vishesh, a resident there.

Stating that they were low-income families who largely depended on the facilities provided by the Corporation, he pointed out that the ICDS centre there for children and a gymnasium which had been damaged by the rains there were yet to be repaired.

“The wall of a graveyard here which collapsed during the rains is yet to be repaired and the residents have been asking for it to be rebuilt for a while now,” said Dhevaki, another resident there.

A section of residents in a few of the localities in Kotturpuram have taken garbage segregation and improving general cleanliness into their own hands. “We started a ‘Swacch Kotturpuram’ initiative and cleaned areas near bins as well as painted walls near them. While we are trying to motivate residents to segregate garbage, as a long-term solution, the corporation can pitch in by helping us set up a vermin-compost unit as we have already identified some space for the same,” said Chandra Prabhakar, Treasurer of the Nawab Gardens Residents Welfare Association.

While the congested lanes at Kottur are filled with retail outlets and vendors selling fruits, vegetables and other items on the sides of the road, Councillor G. Kandhan said that they would soon be shifted to the newly constructed complex of 43 shops that the corporation had constructed in Erikarai Salai.

“At the start of my tenure, I had also helped re-construct six buildings at the Kotturpuram Housing Board which were in a dilapidated condition.

The floods that hit the city last month brought to light numerous civic issues that have remain unaddressed by the Corporation of Chennai (CoC). Sewage mixing with storm water and flooding homes was one such prominent issue that affected many localities. In East Kamaraj Nagar in Thiruvanmiyur, over 175 homes were flooded with rain water mixed with sewage.

The East Kamaraj Nagar (North) Residents Welfare Association, Thiruvanmiyur, decided to take legal action and filed a case against the CoC at the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on December 23, 2015. Mahendar Natarajan, Secretary of the Association, says the locality was flooded as the storm water drains in the area are not connected to any water body. “There is no storm water drain network from Radha Krishnan Nagar to East Kamaraj Nagar (North). We have been raising this issue for four years and despite numerous complaints, no action was taken.”

He explains that as water levels rose during the monsoon, the CoC pumped rainwater from Radha Krishnan Nagar to East Kamaraj Nagar (North), further aggravating the situation.

Rain water that collects in East Kamaraj Nagar (North) has to flow through Thiruvalluvar Salai, Thiruvanmiyur LB Road signal, through West Avenue and finally into the South Buckingham canal. “As the storm water drain at the LB Road signal junction is in a dilapidated condition, the flow of water is restricted. A few years ago, the CoC had started constructing a storm water drain (precast) at this junction but stopped work midway,” he says.

The Tribunal gave its verdict on January 12, 2016 in favour of the Association, and a combined exercise will be carried out by CoC and Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) to resolve the issue. The CoC is required to connect the locality’s storm water drains to the Buckingham Canal and has agreed to resume construction at an estimated cost of Rs. 5.54 lakh.

After the case was filed, the Regional Deputy Commissioner (South), Chief Engineer, Superintending Engineer (SWD), and the Sanitary Inspector of CoC along with local residents inspected the site on January 9, 10, and 11. Illegal sewer connections given by a few hostels in the area were identified and notices issued against them under Section 44 of the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act 1939. “We have been promised that once the CoC obtains necessary permissions, work will be completed in three weeks.”

The NGT is encouraging other welfare associations across the city to approach the Tribunal and seek legal action for similar issues.

Skymet Weather Team

At least eight people were washed away in the gushing flood waters in Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh after two days of heavy downpour. A high alert was sounded in Hyderabad after the Met office forecast more rain in the next few days.

Monsoon remained vigorous over Coastal Andhra Pradesh during the last 24 hours on account of further intensification of low pressure are into well-marked low-pressure area.

As a result, heavy to very heavy rains battered several parts of the state including Guntur. Several streets and houses have been submerged in flood water.

In wake of incessant rains, around 5000 people have been reportedly evacuated from Guntur district to the relief camps. Rail tracks have also been breached due to which rain link between Secunderabad and Guntur was cut off for over 30 hours.

Weathermen predict that flood situation will remain grim for another 24 to 48 hours. Heavy to very heavy rains will continue to batter the region during the next 24 hours. Thereafter, the Monsoon system will shift westwards and as a result, intensity of rains will reduce but moderate will continue over the region.

Officials opened the crest gates at the Sriramsagar project on Saturday evening and released 50,000 cusecs downstream into the Godavari.

The Sriramsagar project, got filled up in just 24 hours due to heavy floods reaching the dam to the tune of 4.45 lakh cusecs contributed mainly from upstream Maharastra. The dam filled up to its brim after three years.

The project capacity which was 52 TMC ft against the full capacity of 90 TMCft on Friday, got filled within 24 hours on Saturday evening and became surplus forcing authorities to open the crest gates.

There have been heavy inflows into River Godavari, downstream of Sriramsagar project for the last few days due to all the medium irrigation projects and the major project of Yellampally getting filled up.

With SRSP gates opened and likely increase of releases into the river to the order of three lakh cusecs for a couple days, revenue officials issued an alert along the river’s course in entire north Telangana region.

With SRSP also becoming surplus, the 660 km course of the Godavari right from Kandakurhty in Nizamabad (foreshore of SRSP) up to Dhawaleswaram near Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh is in spate as every major and medium irrigation project along the course has opened its gates to release flood waters downstream. Given heavy rains in Karimnagar district along with SRSP releases in Kakatiya Canal, the Lower Manair Dam (24 TMC ft) is also likely to be filled up in the next two days.

Elsewhere in Telangana, the Manjira, one of the tributaries of the Godavari is in spate since Friday. The first major project, 30-tmc ft Singur dam in Medak got filled and officials opened flood gates to release 1.57 lakh cusecs downstream. This has led to inundation at Vana Durga Devi temple at Yedupayala and water gushing into Manjeera river to reach Nizamsagar in Nizamabad district.

The Nizamsagar project (full capacity 17 tmc ft), which was receiving inflows since Friday morning at a modest 1,000 cusecs saw that increase to 45,872 cusecs by Saturday evening. According to officials, the project will be filled up by Sunday evening. If Nizamsagar gets filled, all major, medium and minor irrigation sources in the state will be filled to the brim.

The sole exception is Nagarjunasagar, an inter-state project, which still has little water that can be put to use. As regards Krishna Basin projects, there is a steady inflow of one lakh cusecs at Jurala due to upstream inflows from both Krishna (Almatti and Narayanapur) and Bheema (Ujjain dam) for at least a week.

The Srisailam dam getting a total inflow of 1,24,720 cusecs at 5 pm on Saturday saw a rise in levels to 170 TMC against full capacity of 215 tmc ft and level to 876.50 ft against full level of 885 ft.

Nearly 400 people, including university students, were taken to safety today by a team of defence and NDRF personnel as operations continued in full swing to rescue and distribute relief to those stranded in the aftermath of the torrential rains in Chennai.

Defence aircraft as also a couple of civilian ones ferried people to Delhi and Hyderabad since morning even as IAF flew sorties to bring more people to the naval base here that has played a critical role in the overall operations.

“A C-17 Globemaster carrying 172 people left from here at around 11:30 AM for Delhi. A TrueJet flight also took off carrying 70 people, who were flown to Hyderabad.

“An IndiGo flight will soon fly to Delhi with 150 people on board,” a senior naval official said.

‘INS Rajali’, the naval base here and the Tambaram Air Base, about 30km outside of Chennai, have been working in tandem over the past several days to bring people to safety.

Over 600 people, including stranded civilians and defence personnel, were yesterday flown out from here.

“We sent about 300 people from the Tambaram Base to Arakonnam Base throughout the day. No more sorties are planned as yet,” said Flight Lieutenant Mohanan Chandrika at Tamabaram Base.

The navy official added that Mi-14 and AN-32 brought people in batches to the base as operations continued this morning.

Meanwhile, as large areas of Chennai airport remained flooded, commercial operations continued to be suspended there although technical flights have commenced.

The Arakonnam base, located 70km west of Chennai, is currently serving as the makeshift airport.

Civilian aircraft started a few rescue flights from yesterday and four sorties ferried about 320 people from here to different place.

“A TrueJet flight and a SpiceJet flight took people to Hyderabad and Bangalore, respectively, yesterday morning and two flights of IndiGo ferried rescued persons to Delhi,” the official said.

Around 150 people, among them 130 rescued civilians and the rest from the defence forces, were flown out on an IndiGo flight yesterday afternoon from the base. The other IndiGo flight, carrying 180 people, had left at night.

As the recent deluge recedes and landmarks in the city become visible once again, sheets of water vanish to reveal the black tar on roads, and a battered population tries to get back to its feet, images of rains, floods and suffering from the past come to the mind.

Though cyclones, depressions and storms are an annual occurrence in Chennai, some years like 1985, when former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran was evacuated from his Ramapuram garden home, or 1976, when the Army stepped in to keep the Manali oil refinery running, are unforgettable.

1903- Rains bring floods

In 1903, the year the Indian National Congress session was held in Madras, the city faced heavy rains and floods. Historian V. Sriram says that leading lawyer and judge of the Madras High Court V. Krishnaswamy Iyer, who was the main force behind the session, had put up delegates at his bungalow on Luz Church Road. “After the session, his work was greatly appreciated by those in the welcoming committee and even by Dada Bhai Navroji, who was impressed by his shraddai ,” he says.

1918 - 'Cyclone of unusual fury'

The year 1918 too was bad. “A terrible cyclone of unusual fury passed through Madras. The Madras public was quite unprepared to meet the uncommon storm as the report was received yesterday and could not be published in the newspapers,” says a report in The Hindu on November 11, 1918.

1943: No trains to ride

Writer Ashokamitran, who came to Madras in 1943 to drop his sister at her husband’s home in Saidapet, recalls how trains wouldn’t ply to Saidapet due to the rain. “We had bought tickets for Saidapet but the train stopped at Mambalam. We took a jutka to Saidapet and dropped her,” he says. It was in 1943 that The Hindu ’s Srinivasan offered to print other newspapers when power supply was restored to The Hindu alone.

The 1985 floods bear a semblance to this year’s fury. The Kotturpuram slum clearance board tenements were flooded, with Ambattur and Madhavaram dairies flooded most of the city went without milk, water from Chembarambakkam was released and people residing on the banks were cautioned to move to safer places. It was this year too that Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran and his wife Janaki shifted to the Connemara Hotel after waters from the raging Adyar river surrounded their Ramavaram Garden house. He took a boat from his house to reach his car parked on higher ground on the Porur Road and then drove to the hotel.

In more recent times, in 2005, torrential rain, caused by a deep depression over the Bay of Bengal, disrupted life in Chennai and northern Tamil Nadu in October. At least 50,000 people were shifted to relief centres, as houses in several low-level areas were submerged. The rainstorm in northern Tamil Nadu came just as the Cauvery districts were slowly recovering from the heavy flooding that followed huge inflows into the river from Karnataka.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

City opens its doors

It’s early yet on Wednesday morning, but Dr. Sai Kishore from Paalavakkam is busy wading through water-logged streets, handing out packets of food to those in need. The medico who runs the K.L. Hospital in Neelankarai, threw open his hospital doors for those stranded in the rain. “As of last evening we had at least 10 families take shelter at the hospital. We went around picking up those stranded in the hospital ambulance. After a point though the ambulance could not ply on the water-logged streets. Now, my team and I are going around the area distributing packets of food that we cooked in the hospital mess to those in need,” he explains, adding, “The way the city has come together to help others in need is very encouraging. There is such a sense of unity at this time of crisis.”Help came from all corners as Sowmya Reddy put together a crowd-sourced Google doc encouraging people to open up their homes to those affected by the floods. With nearly 225 volunteers posting their contact details and offering to host people in their homes, the list has come as a boon for the city.

Naveen Kumar, an IT employee who lives in Kotturpuram, had people from the Mandaveli area seek refuge at his house. “I did the same last week and am more than willing to host people this time round too. The situation is pretty bad and it’s the one way I could extend help, so why not? I had two people come over last night and we provided them with food and shelter,” he says.

While Suresh Kumar, a volunteer from Medavakkam, didn’t receive any calls from people looking for shelter, he did receive calls from people wading through the flood waters and looking for some food. “A group of people got in touch with me through my listing. They had been walking from OMR to Kovilavakkam through water-logged streets and were looking for something to eat, before they could continue their walk home. I got food packed from a nearby restaurant and went and gave it to them. Anybody looking for shelter is most welcome to get in touch with me,” he says.

Help comes from New York

Krtgrphr, a New York-based Chennaiite spent 15 hours volunteering information on the Internet Kartik, who goes by @krtgrphr on Twitter, is managing many tabs on his laptop sitting in New York. On any other day, this would seem like a normal activity for someone who is online a lot, but Tuesday night and Wednesday morning were all about offering help to strangers stranded in Chennai due to the rain. Krtgrphr (who prefers to go by his Twitter handle) has been volunteering for 15 hours non-stop so far, and is still going strong. From contributing to the document on '#ChennaiRains Resource Center' (chennairains.org) to just as simply spreading the word by retweeting important information and sharing important numbers, the 29-year-old researcher for IBM is making a difference, just like many others on popular social networking sites.

“There’s so much to do behind the scenes; we’re all just a bunch of people who have time on our hands,” he says. On Twitter, trying to find information on what was going on in Chennai, krtgrphr admits that he was feeling helpless about not being able to “effect change on the ground. So you try to do anything you can.”

While a lot of people have opened up their homes, some have started distributing food packets, water and clothes in their areas. How can people sitting at home help? “They can help us right now by connecting those without connections or power or battery to rescue services, food, shelter etc.

And help anyone you see around,” he urges. As a former resident of Chennai, krtgrphr is one of the many who has used social media to effect change for the good. “It’s the participants that make Twitter what it really is.”

Fishermen sail in to help

The fishermen of Chennai are rowing their boats in the flooded streets of the city to rescue those who are stranded. Boats from places such as Kasimedu, Kottivakkam Kuppam, and Kovalam are being transported in trucks along with fishermen-volunteers to the flood-hit regions. “We rescued some 400 people since morning,” says Selvam, a fisherman from Kovalam. A trained life-guard and surfer, Selvam reached Pallikaranai early in the day along with 18 men from the fishing village.

“We’ve brought three fibre boats, each of which can carry 18 people,” he calls out on the phone from the rescue site over the sound of ambulance sirens. “Those we ferried to safety are all from settlements along the Pallikaranai marsh; they’ve lost everything.”

Selvam and team have put in place a well-planned rescue operation. “The moment we help people into our boats, we row towards safe zones that our men have identified. They wait there for us along with a local who guides us,” he explains. Fisherman Mohan from Kottivakkam also had an early start as he made his way in his fibre boat to rescue those who were stranded. “A lot of men from the kuppam have gone along with him,” says his wife Nithya. “They’ve taken several boats with them… I hope they’re all safe.”

M.D. Dayalan, president of the Indian Fishermen Association, says that Kasimedu alone has offered 40 boats for rescue work. “Our men are coordinating with the Fisheries Department. Boats from as far as Neelankarai and Kanathur are in the city, helping people in low-lying areas.”

Restaurants spring into action

With rescue efforts pouring in, some of the restaurants in the city have also sprung into action. On Tuesday night Japtej Ahluwalia and Nikesh Lamba of Double Roti offered complimentary meals at their outlets in Neelankarai and Cenotaph Road. “Quite a few families passing by stopped for a bite. A lot of cyclists and two-wheeler riders came in too for a quick hot meal,” says Japtej. With the inner roads of Neelankarai flooding, more people ended up in that outlet. Maggi was the most popular dish followed by burgers and sandwiches.

Old Madras Baking Company (OMBC) too welcomed wet stranded passersby for a hot cup of tea/coffee and some sandwiches at all their outlets. Sandy’s, Ox and Tomato and OMBC are open to accommodating people to spend the night there as well. “On Tuesday night about six people spent the night at Sandy’s in Ganapathy Colony,” says Mansi Sandesh Reddy. Tryst cafe put together food boxes to be dispatched to people in need.

VOICES

Anita Ratnam, classical and contemporary dancer-choreographer

Her house is full of people; just waking up to steaming cups of tea after a long, frightening night. “I was on my way to the airport with a group of ten dancers yesterday to catch a flight to Thailand for a contemporary dance festival. We got into the car at 8 p.m., and eventually gave up because we could not access the airport. We got home at midnight, and on the way I saw eight to nine people huddled under a big tree outside my house. It was terrible,” says Anita.

She responded by opening her home to as many people as she could house, a total of 18, including all the dancers. “I also handed out everything I could: towels, blankets, T-shirts… I completely cleaned out the fridge,” she says, “We slept on every available surface, just using cushions, quilts and all my shawls… I didn’t think about it, I just did it. And that’s how the city is responding to the rain.”

She adds, “We are part of a momentous disaster. Whatever we can do, we do. At least this rain has shown one thing about our city: we are extremely hospitable: warm, welcoming and trusting. I’m not surprised people are opening their homes. Remember in Tamil custom we never say goodbye – we say ‘vaanga’, please come.”

“I would have loved to see the glittering establishments of this city throw open their lobbies as well. When 9/11 happened in New York, all the five star hotels ran ads saying, ‘Please come in’. They opened soup kitchens. Here it is the individual citizens who are reflective of the spirit of the city. It is in crisis that character emerges.”

Sam Paul, lawyer and entrepreneur

On Tuesday, as flood waters rose in and around Chennai, Sam Paul rounded a group of friends and family members and started a rescue service. They split into teams and went about rescuing marooned families, supplying food, medicine and offering shelter. Sam’s house as of now is hosting four families. “We rescued a family from Perambur where the water level was 12 feet. Two grandparents and a grandson. We even rescued a dog. Our friends too have opened up their houses for those stranded,” he says.

Till about 7.30 am on Wednesday Sam, Lenin Paul, Ajit Sigamani and Jose Sigamani drove through Mudichur, Velachery, Guduvanchery, Madipakkam and Tambaram getting stranded people out.

Pleased with how people from the city are banding together to lend support, Sam says activist Abdul Ghani and his team too are doing good work. “They even rescued a pregnant woman, who was then admitted to SRM hospital where she delivered a baby,” he says.

In addition Sam’s restaurant chain of Jonah’s is cooking and supplying food for 300 people.

The initiative has grown with more people joining in as volunteers and shortly a Facebook page titled Chennai food, rescue and shelter will be up to spread the message and services.

“Our Covelong boys team helped the stranded during the floods by using whatever was available such as kayaks, catamarans and fishing boats. We rescued around 200 girls from hostels and also other college students. We had fun doing it - clowned around a bit by taking advantage of the empty toll booths.”

Wipro , which employs 22,000 people across Chennai, is the latest IT service provider to warn of the impact of the floods in a city that has become a hub for the industry along with other centres like Bangalore and Hyderabad.

Rival Tata Consultancy Services warned on Friday that the floods would have a ""material impact"" on its third-quarter revenues. TCS employs 65,000 people in Chennai, roughly a fifth of its total.

Floods ravaged Chennai after heavy rains began in November, killing some 280 people and displacing 400,000 people across Tamil Nadu state.

Wipro said in a statement that revenues for the quarter ending on Dec. 31 would be in the lower half of its $1.84 billion to $1.88 billion range, while it would also book a one-off cost.

The recent heavy record deluge of rainfall over Chennai was due to above normal sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal, presence of monsoon trough close to Chennai, prevailing easterly waves and strong easterly winds. The 2015 El Nino phenomenon weakened South west monsoon winds which in turn led to less churning and upwelling in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea and resulted in higher sea surface temperatures due to less mixing of cold waters with warm surface waters. This had a warming effect in Bay of Bengal. During the post-NW monsoon withdrawal period (later part of October and November) a monsoon trough prevailed around 13N latitude (latitude of Chennai) over peninsular India and Bay of Bengal.

The monsoon trough is a large area of low pressure that can move in any direction and carry convective winds with it. The high SSTs moistened the boundary layer (the lowest layer of the atmosphere in touch with the ocean surface) by evaporation. This moist air was lifted high up in the atmosphere by easterly waves emanating some distance from the coast at Chennai. Easterly waves are an atmospheric phenomenon wherein the wind moves in a wave like motion with the distance from crest to crest being as much as 2000 km (with a forward and rear sections of 1000 km each) and the period about two to three days. “Therefore it can be believed that the phenomenon might have persisted for 3 -4 days with spatial scales of approximately 500-1000km,”said Dr. J.R. Kulkarni, Team Expert, World Meteorological Organization, Ex-Adviser, IITM, Pune, to this Correspondent with whom he was in telephone and email contact.

The upward motion of the winds in the wave is called divergence and the downward, convergence. The divergence lifted moisture bearing air with it and carried it high up into the atmosphere as rain bearing clouds, and the easterly winds drove these clouds towards Chennai where they precipitated as rain. The continuous formation of clouds over Bay of Bengal, their transformation into deep convective clouds, their movement towards land and to Chennai city provided continuous heavy rainfall over land and the Chennai area. These clouds provided very heavy rainfall of the order of 150 mm/hour. If the rainfall is more than 100 mm/hour, then it is termed as a cloud burst.

For converting water into vapour, energy is required to provide to the water molecules. This energy is called latent heat of vaporization. As the water vapor goes up it cools due to ambient cooler atmosphere. It becomes saturated. The water vapor turns into water droplets. In this process, the energy stored in the water vapor is released to the atmosphere. This heats the cloud air. The cloud air becomes warm and light. The cloud air gets acceleration in upward direction because of receiving of latent heat. Temperature in the atmosphere decreases with height. At about 5 km above the ground, temperature becomes 0°C. This is called freezing level. The cloud drops freeze and become ice above freezing level. In the freezing process heat is released which is called latent heat of freezing. The cloud droplets and ice particles get additional upward motion by getting this energy. This way the cloud grows to a very high altitude.

Studies have shown that south west and north east monsoons have negative correlation. North east monsoon during the 2009 El Nino year was stronger than normal. Rainfall in 2009 north east monsoon was 12 per cent more than long term normal (IMD Departmental website Chennai). This year’s high north east monsoon rainfall performance is consistent with earlier findings of negative correlation between the two monsoons in the El Nino years. The higher than normal sea surface temperatures are the real fuel of such deep convection. Climatologically these anomalies weaken in the December. Therefore it may be conjectured that heavy rainfall activity may weaken in December. “Radar data are required to check movement of clouds, their transformation into deep convective clouds, and their spatial and temporal scales. Modeling studies are required for examining various linkages in the proposed mechanism,” said Dr. Kulkarni.

“Extreme weather events are indeed increasing due to global warming. This is because a warmer climate can hold more moisture in the atmosphere, leading to heavier rainfall when it does occur. However, it’s difficult to say for certain that a particular extreme event – like the Chennai floods – is attributable to anthropogenic climate change,” says Dr. Roxy Mathew Koll of The Indian Institute of Tropical Maeteorology, Pune.",discussion,2015 Chennai floods,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","December 1, 2015","December 10, 2015",Chennai city and suburbs,494 mm,"Rs. 10,000 crore",464,1.2 million people displaced,"The floods were caused by a combination of factors, including above-normal sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal, the presence of a monsoon trough close to Chennai, prevailing easterly waves, and strong easterly winds.

Several low-lying areas in Kancheepuram, including major thoroughfare Gandhi Road, were inundated as the town and its neighbourhood received a heavy precipitation of 34 cm during the 24-hours that ended with 8.30 a.m. on Friday.

The town experienced heavy downpour from around 11 p.m. on Thursday night to till early morning on Friday.

The Manjalneer Kalvai, primarily a flood drain channel for the town, overflowed after the Netteri lake breached on the Kancheepuram-Vellore Road in the wee hours of Friday, flooding the entire stretch of Gandhi Road and Munusamy Mudaliyar Avenue and forcing the police to close for traffic the prime junction Moongil Mandapam where the Gandhi Road joins with Vallal Pachaiyappan Salai. However, the water on the Gandhi Road and Munusamy Mudaliyar Avenue receded in the afternoon.

The Gundukulam lake near Kathirpur also breached resulting in flooding of the Vegavathi river, which was already filled up with flood water that drained from Sevilimedu tank due to unchecked growth of dwelling units along its bank between Pillayarpalayam and up to Nagaluthumedu in Little Kancheepuram. The overflowing water from the river inundated agricultural fields and residential areas, before draining into the Manjalneer Kalvai on Krishnan Street.

Rengasamykulam and Ashtabhujam tank, located in the vicinity of Gandhi Road, however, received minimum inflow despite heavy precipitation overnight.

Collector R.Gajalakshmi told reporters later that a total of 7,294 persons were rescued from inundated areas and accommodated in 26 shelters opened by the civic body.

Boats were used to rescue the people from inundated areas in Pillayarpalayam, the Collector said.

Kancheepuram residents were elated to see both the banks of Palar near Sevilimedu and Orikkai flowing with water.

Chennai swamped

The overnight rainstorm in Chennai swamped several areas in the city and suburbs, flooding houses in low level and paralysed daily life on Friday.

Puzhal recorded the highest volume of 21 cm of rainfall. The weather stations in Chennai and Meenambakkam recoded 15 cm and 12 cm. However, during the day, the city received only 1 cm of rain.

Residents of several areas, including Ambattur, Avadi, Thirumullaivoyal and Mudichur are confined to their homes in knee deep level water.

December 1993 remains etched in Madurai’s memory, though the earliest recorded flood was in December 1677, when many huts in the villages around the city were swept away. Rainfall triggered by a severe cyclonic storm between December 1 and 4, 1993, resulted in release of about one lakh cusecs of water into the Vaigai. Simultaneously, the Sathayar dam, a minor reservoir that conserves water flowing in a jungle stream and surplus from dams upstream in Dindigul and Theni districts, overflowed due to heavy rainfall in the Sirumalai Hills. The surplus filled up 14 tanks and resulted in breaches and water release. In Madurai city, a major tank in Sellur breached, submerging many areas in the north.

The 1993 flood was preceded by flooding of the Vaigai in November 1992 when 520 mm rainfall was recorded in a single day in the Manalar Estate of Megamalai in Theni district. This triggered a series of landslides in Megamalai in which at least 37 people were killed.

Flood marooned north Madurai, where almost all the government departments are located. Water entered the Government Rajaji hospital and telecommunication network was cut off. The worst impact was in Sellur, the hub of world famous handloom industry, where about 12,000 looms fell silent. The industry has not recovered from this mortal blow. Many were forced to leave their homes and a few deaths were reported in Sellur. It took three days for the flood water to recede.

The flood was caused by chocking of storm water carriers. Madurai, once a city of tanks, had 46 water bodies, of which only seven are alive now. Many are in disuse or used to drain sewage. Sixteen tanks have been filled with buildings. Reacting to the flood, the Madurai Corporation implemented a scheme to desilt all storm water canals in 1994. Encroachments in the Vaigai and major canals were removed and people given alternative sites to set up home in Sakkimangalam, far away from Madurai. Later, all streets were provided with storm water drains. After two decades, the Vaigai continues to remain in a state of neglect and water carriers are used to liberally dump urban waste.

After December 1677, the next flood was accompanied by a cyclone on December 18, 1709. According to B.S. Balinga’s report in the Madurai District Gazetteer , most of the tanks breached at that time and “a mighty wave of water surged through the district carrying everything before it.” A “terrific storm” swept Madurai neighbourhood in November 1814, killing 3000 cattle. The Vaigai witnessed “extraordinary freshes” in December 1843. An “unusually high flood” was seen in 1884. The Vaigai overflowed on November 30 and December 1, 1922, when “flood water reached as far as the Meenakshi Temple on the southern side and invaded Goripalayam in the north. Every railway line leaving Madurai was breached and Sholavandan station was under water.” After the opening of the Vaigai dam on January 29, 1959, the river was in spate in 1977 and 1979, when a chopper involved in rescue operation went down.",,1993 Madurai Flood,"Madurai, Tamil Nadu","December 1, 1993","December 4, 1993",North Madurai,1 lakh cusecs,"12,000 looms fell silent",a few,The industry has not recovered from this mortal blow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

For several long-time residents of Tiruchi, last week’s Chennai floods brought back vivid memories of the 1977 floods that ravaged the city. That calamity was next only to the 1924 deluge — considered the worst ever of the 20th century in the region.

The Cauvery River and the Coleroon, essentially a flood carrier, several minor rivers, jungle streams and the network of irrigation system make Tiruchi flood-prone, especially during the North East monsoon. Tiruchi has witnessed floods in 1924, 1952, 1954, 1965, 1977, 1979, 1983, 1999, 2000 and in 2005.

Tiruchi 1977 still haunts those who survived the fury. The Cauvery was in spate with heavy inflows from Karnataka when a strong cyclone crossed the Nagapattinam coast on November 12 sweeping in nothing but water, wind and havoc. Though it got weakened into a cyclonic storm that evening over interior parts of Tamil Nadu, it emerged in the Lakshadweep islands the following day as a deep depression, according to a record of the Indian Meteorological Department (http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/static/cyclone-history-bb.htm).

“The maximum wind (speed) recorded is about 120 kmph on the 12th morning in Thanjavur, Tiruchirapalli and Pudukottai districts. An estimated 560 people died and more than 10 lakh were rendered homeless. 23,000 heads of cattle perished. The total damage to private and public property is estimated to be Rs.155 crore,” says the record.

Most parts of Tiruchi city and scores of villages in the composite district were up to seven feet under water. In Tiruchi city, the water almost reached the Mainguard Gate, the gateway to Rockfort. “St. Joseph’s College, Holy Cross College and Seethalakshmi Ramaswami College were inundated. The famous library of St. Joseph’s College suffered extensive damage,” recalls a former vice-principal V. Rangarajan. “The library lost 21,000 volumes of books on November 13,” says a reference in the college website.

Mr. Rangarajan observes that the water level rose rapidly. There were three feet of water in his ground floor house off the Salai Road nearby in no time. Many residents spent two or three nights atop terraces, including this writer, then in school. The Army was called out and fishermen from coastal areas chipped in, rescuing people in coracles from the marooned areas. With radio being the only mode of communication then, rumours kept people on tenterhooks. A rumour that the Bhavanisagar Dam had burst saw hundreds of people running on the streets and many climbed the Rockfort with whatever personal belongings they could carry.

The city faced an equally severe flood in 2005. The Cauvery breached its bank at Vengur near Tiruchi and overflowed at several other places. The island town of Srirangam, wedged between Cauvery and Coleroon, came under threat as the Cauvery bank almost breached at Melur before villagers and the Army reinforced the bund, averting a disaster.",flood,1977 Tiruchi Flood,"Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, India","November 12, 1977","November 13, 1977",Tiruchirapalli city and scores of villages in the composite district,7 feet,Rs.155 crore,560,"Most parts of Tiruchi city and scores of villages in the composite district were up to seven feet under water.

The flooding of Saidapet last week has left many wondering if the nearby underground Chennai Metro Rail station will be deluged should another disaster of this kind strike the city again.

Officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) said the flooding of the site occurred because it was under construction and that this would not happen when the stations and tunnels were complete.

“We are constructing the station at a height of about 1.2-1.5 metres above the road; so this may not happen. We are initiating other precautionary measures too,” he added.

10 days

It might take another 10 days for them to pump out water from the site after the recent flooding, he said. “We are using motors of 100-150 HP to pump out water from the site,” he added.

But another official noted the underground stations were equipped to handle normal monsoon rains with facilities to drain water; but should a flooding like this happen, it might not be possible to operate the stations.

Urban planning experts too echo the view that it may not be possible to avoid deluge of an underground station. “If the tunnel starts at the mouth of a river, then there are ways of shutting it; but rarely do people take such precautions,” an urban planning expert, seeking anonymity, said.

Also, there are questions emerging on whether the tunnel itself led out water from the Adyar into various areas, subsequently causing flooding there.

“It may have led water into some areas like Teynampet and T. Nagar; but the impact would have been far worse if the tunnel had not taken in large quantities of water from the flooding river,” an official said.

But urban planning experts say one cannot buy this argument.

“The tunnel could not have definitely reduced the flooding; it can take only a fraction of the quantity of water released by the river,” he added.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

As the flood water recedes in Chennai, serious questions are being raised about reservoir management in the city. Much of the flooding and subsequent waterlogging was a consequence of the outflows from major reservoirs into swollen rivers and into the city following heavy rains. The release of waters from the Chembarambakkam reservoir in particular has received much attention.

Official data from the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board for the last 20 days suggest that the high precipitation and reservoir outflows on November 16 and December 1 respectively were primarily responsible for swelling the rivers. On November 17, 18,000 cusecs was released from the reservoir in Chembarambakkam.

However, from November 24 to November 30, when the city experienced minimal rainfall, the outflows from the reservoir were limited, even as the storage levels were maintained at almost 85-88% of the total capacity of 3645 mcft. When heavy rains to the tune of nearly 48 cm fell on the reservoir on December 1, 29,000 cusecs was released over 12 hours.

Experts raise the question as to why storage was set at such high levels. Professor Janakarajan of the Madras Institute of Development Studies also argues that the outflow management from the reservoir was improper. If storage levels were set at less than 75% and sluice gates were opened to allow for outflow from the reservoir in a way that it exceeded the inflows in the last week of November, the blow in the form of the high outflow on December 1 could have been softened, he asserts.

Officials formerly with the PWD say if the risk of releasing a particular volume prior to the heavy rainfall day had been taken, there would have been lesser floods in places like K.K.Nagar.

It is reliably learnt that the government is considering a move to further reduce the set storage level in the reservoir. Now the level is at two feet below the brim, and discussions are under way to change this to four feet.

Reservoir managers ignored warnings of heavy downpour

On November 17, 18,000 cusecs was released from the reservoir in Chembarambakkam, causing massive flooding in areas such as Mudichur, West Tambaram, and Manapakkam among others.

However, from November 24 to November 30, when the city experienced minimal rainfall, the outflows from the reservoir were limited. Officials in the Public Works Department asserted that the inflow of 31,000 cusecs (26,000 before 6:00 p.m. owing to the high rainfall) resulted in the high outflow of 29,000 cusecs from the reservoir on December 1 and that they couldn’t hold the reservoir beyond a point.

Former officials of the department, however, said if they had taken the risk of releasing a particular volume from the reservoir prior to the heavy rainfall day, water received from some tanks like Porur and Mudichur could have been stored.

The decision to conservatively hold storage despite early warnings from various meteorological agencies about heavy rainfall in the offing in late November and early December, clearly exacerbated the disaster that followed.

This was in addition to the structural issues in Chennai with floodplains and drainage systems being constrained by unplanned urbanisation.

Storage levels in Chembarambakkam and other reservoirs are decided based on drinking water requirements for the city and other areas in summer.

That the authorities should have hedged on the side of flood management over concerns on drinking water is now evident in hindsight.

The last century have shown that there were several catastrophic flooding in Chennai in 1943, 1978, 1985, 2002 and 205 caused by heavy rain associated with cyclonic activity. These disruptive events were found to be atrributable to failure in maintaining major rivers and drainage systems. Flooding of lesser magnitude occurs regularly in low-lying areas of Chennai and its suburbs because of inoperativeness of the local drainage infrastructure

After an 8-hour downpour, triggered by cyclonic activity, battered Ambasamudram, Vickramasingapuram and Papanasam, all situated close to the Papanasam and Servalar dams in the Western Ghats, on November 13, 1992, residents, who had never witnessed such torrential rain, confined themselves to their houses out of fear.

And the few families living at Thiruvalluvar Nagar near the Tamirabharani watercourse at Vickramasingapuram went to bed in the night with the hope that the downpour would subside in the morning. However, the unprecedented heavy overnight discharge from these reservoirs ultimately became a watery grave for 17 persons as they were trapped in their houses. Even as these two dams were overflowing, Papanasam dam, built by the British, received 310 mm of rainfall on November 13, 1992, and the Servalar dam recorded 210 mm rainfall. On its part, the Papanasam Lower Dam experienced a rainfall of 190 mm.

At the same time, the precipitation was unprecedented at Vickramasingapuram and Ambasamudram on the foothills of the Western Ghats, which received a rainfall of 320.60 mm on that day and the nearby Manimuthar dam, had 260.80 mm rainfall.

Left with no other option, the officials were compelled to open the floodgates of Papanasam and Seravalar dams in the night of that fateful day.

Water discharged from the two dams knocked down the Mundanthurai bridge within a few minutes and submerged houses on the banks of the river killing 17 persons at Thiruvalluvar Nagar in the early hours of November 14, 1992.

The situation worsened within next 60 minutes when over 60,000 cusecs of water was discharged from the Manimuthar dam. “The Tamirabharani carried a surplus water of 2,04,273.80 cusecs from three dams alone on that day and the quantum of water that flowed into the river from the rainfall at Vickramasingapuram, Ambasamudram and Kallidaikurichi was immeasurable,” recalls a Public Works Department staff, who was then working at Manimuthar dam.

Consequently, the flood that triggered devastation everywhere entered even Tirunelveli Junction bus stand, submerged more than 10 buses parked there and entered the Collectorate along on the banks. The flood subsided after nearly 48 hours after inundating most of the commercial establishments around the bus stand and railway junction and nearby residential areas like Sindupoondurai, Kailasapuram and Meenakshipuram.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

For residents of TVH Park Villa, a gated community on Thoraipakkam-Pallikaranai Radial Road, the road to recovery after the floods has been tough.

It was only two months ago that the 275-flat apartment complex revamped its rainwater harvesting wells, sewage treatment plant and swimming pool by pooling in Rs.60,000 from each resident. But, the floods ravaged most of these facilities.

“Water entered the generators located at the complex, our compound wall measuring 100-ft broke, lifts stopped working and over 90 per cent of the cars got submerged in the flood waters,” says Vinod Kumar, a committee member of TVH Park Villa Flat Owners Welfare Association.

There are now plans to increase the height of the generator from the car parking level.

Many such apartment complexes are planning such preventive measures. Seabrook Apartments in Valmiki Nagar will be building more recharge wells on its premises so that surface runoffs are absorbed by these structures. In most apartments, there is pressure to convert the common area into parking space. We have not cemented the common area and have decided to build separate recharge wells for the surface runoffs to collect,” says V. Srinivasan, former secretary of Seabrook Apartments.

Eleven-storey Ceebros Boulevard at Thoraipakkam is looking at increasing the capacity of conduits on its premises.

“There are many other disaster mitigation measures we are studying with the objective of introducing them. Most apartments stock diesel for a day or two. After the prolonged power cuts during the floods, we are studying if more volume could be stocked. If so, what kind of permission is required,” says Ravi Kumar, a committee member.

Serene Acres, a 179-flat complex in Pallikaranai, is planning to pool in money from residents so that it can carry out maintenance work including increasing the height of the sump.

Experts say resident associations should take up the issue with the Corporation to make sure that the road height does not rise every year. The height of the road should be 3ft (minimum) below ground floor level of the building, say experts.

Chennai is perhaps experiencing the worst impact of freak weather, but the city could have fared better had it protected and preserved its natural water bodies and drainage channels, experts at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said on Thursday.

The unprecedented deluge that Chennai has been subjected to is a reminder of increasing frequency of such freak weather events across the Indian sub-continent, they said.

Speaking on the subject, CSE director-general Sunita Narain said: “We have repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that our urban sprawls such as Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Srinagar etc. have not paid adequate attention to the natural water bodies that exist in them. In Chennai, each of its lakes has a natural flood discharge channel which drains the spillover. But we have built over many of these water bodies, blocking the smooth flow of water. We have forgotten the art of drainage. We only see land for buildings, not for water.”

Waterbodies

CSE’s research shows that Chennai had more than 600 waterbodies in the 1980s, but a master plan published in 2008 said that only a fraction of the lakes could be found in a healthy condition. According to records of the State’s Water Resources Department, the area of 19 major lakes has shrunk from a total of 1,130 hectares (ha) in the 1980s to around 645 ha in the early 2000s, reducing their storage capacity. The drains that carry surplus water from tanks to other wetlands have also been encroached upon.

Stormwater drains The analysis also shows that the stormwater drains constructed to drain flood waters are clogged and require immediate desiltation. Chennai has only 855 km of stormwater drains against 2,847 km of urban roads. Thus, even a marginally heavy rainfall causes havoc in the city.

A number of cities including Chennai are both water-scarce as well as prone to flooding. Both problems are related — excessive construction leads to poor recharge of groundwater aquifers and blocking of natural drainage systems.

Sushmita Sengupta, deputy programme manager with CSE’s water team, said: “While Chennai has been struggling to meet its water needs and has been even desalinating seawater at a huge expense, it allowed its aquifers to get depleted.”

Chennai’s human-made drainage is no replacement for its natural drainage systems — a CSE analysis shows that there are natural canals and drains that directly connect the city with wetlands, waterbodies and rivers such as the Cooum and the Adyar that run through Chennai. The Cooum is supposed to collect surplus water from 75 tanks in its catchment area within the Chennai Metropolitan Area, while the Adyar is supposed to carry the surplus water of about 450 tanks in its catchment area and also from the Chembarambakkam tank (which is not in its catchment).

The rains in Chennai have broken a 100-year record (374 mm in just 24 hours). In November, the city had received 1,218 mm of rain, which was almost three times more than the average the city receives (407 mm).

A 2006 study by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) in Pune had said that extreme precipitation events were increasing in frequency and intensity in India during the period from 1950 to the 2000s.

Many government offices in Chennai and nearby areas, which receive considerable footfalls everyday and whose services were severely hit in the recent floods, are attempting to get back on track, trying to dry their files and by organising special camps. The Hindu takes a look at what various departments are doing on this front.

Police stations

A senior officer of Chennai City Police said of the total of 136 police stations covering the city and suburbs, those in the southern and western suburbs were affected badly.

He said of the 36 police stations coming under the Western Region, 12 were flooded including Muthapudupet, Tirumangalam and Avadi and the All Women Police Station at Avadi.

In fact, the flooding was so severe in Muthapudupet that the station to be shifted to another location. Similarly, in north Chennai, police stations at Manali New Town and Ennore came under water.

Another senior officer said that despite several areas in south Chennai facing severe flooding, only in two police stations of Adambakkam and Nandambakkam flood water stagnated for a few days. “Whereas in Velachery though flood water entered they were immediately drained out with a motor,” he said.

He said the police personnel carefully moved the files and computers to safer places and further communication between stations through walkie takies were on, despite the power cut.

Passport services

Though the three Passport Seva Kendras (PSKs) in Chennai remained closed due to incessant rains on December 2 and 3, business continued from December 7. Applicants who had registered on these days were directed to get fresh dates for screening.

Asked whether documents suffered due to the floods, Regional Passport Officer K. Balamurugan said, “All documents and papers are scanned and in server. Also, as of now, nothing is damaged by floods.”

He further said that the Ministry of External Affairs was organising a free-of-cost passport camp on December 12 in all three PSKs for those whose passports were either damaged or lost in the floods. “Our regular services continue,” he said.

Revenue

A senior official of the Revenue Department told The Hindu that the government was ready to conduct a camp to issue pattas to those who had lost them in the flood.

“We have digitised all the land documents and 90 per cent records are available online. Pattas can be easily downloaded from internet. In the case of those who have no access to internet, our department is prepared to conduct a camp and pattas can be issued on the spot,” the official said.

Revenue officials have already begun compiling reports to give the exact picture to the state government to distribute relief measures.

“There is no need to worry about loss of land documents as we have digitised them. Moreover there will be three copies—one with the revenue department, one with the District Collectorate and another one with the Tahsildar office. Lost documents can be easily retrieved,” the official said.

Of the 10 Taluk offices in Chennai, Mambalam was considered worst-affected, as it was located in the ground floor of the low-lying area. “To my knowledge, Mambalam is worst hit. We were able to save only some important files. Since the water gushed in had sewage in it, it is difficult to retrieve the wet files. Also we are waiting for the sunshine to dry the wet files,” an officer working in the Mambalam Taluk Office said.

Though the Taluk office in Guindy is near the Adyar river, it was not affected since the office is located in the first floor. “We were stuck in the office from Tuesday to Thursday last week and only a boat which came here helped us come out. We are now involved in relief work,” the officer said.

Postal services

Some of the post offices in Anakaputhur, Nandambakkam, Guindy Industrial Estate, West Mambalam and Annai Anjugam Nagar (Tambaram) were badly hit in the floods.

Post offices started functioning in full swing only from Monday and a review of damage was in progress. A few post offices have resorted to manual processing of transactions.

While in some post offices, parcels and passports waiting to be sorted out were damaged, others suffered major damages of electronic items worth minimum of Rs.20 lakh.

Officials of the postal department said: “We are still working amidst several challenges like fluctuating power supply in some areas. Some post offices had to air dry damp currency notes meant for money orders using hair dryers.”

Courts

While the Madras High Court campus remained totally safe in the floods, a court in the Saidapet court complex had to be shifted to another place temporarily. “We shifted the court within the same campus and so all the courts continue to function regularly,” Registrar General of the Madras High Court P. Kalaiyarasan said.

The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate courts located at the Allikulam complex near Chennai Corporation buildings too continued to function regularly. “The electricity problem in the complex too was restored,” he said.

Transport

The Regional Transport Offices in the city and suburbs numbering around 12 did not face much of flooding. A senior official said transport office in Valasaravakkam faced flooding, but even there the officials were able to move the files safely.",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The recent floods in the Adyar river have left many residents wondering about flooding in areas that are usually not vulnerable.

The reason is that the Chembarambakkam reservoir, which chiefly contributed to floods in Adyar river, received the highest inflow in 100 years on December 1, much more than the capacity fixed based on flood data of 60 years.

The reservoir’s capacity was last improved in 1996 to handle an inflow of 33,400 cubic feet per second (cusecs). This equals to nearly 10 lakh litres per second. Sources say that the reservoir received was more than 35,000 cusecs on the midnight of December 1.

“If 35,000 cusecs were released into the river, it would have only taken three hours for the flood. But, the discharge was moderated to 29,400 cusecs that took six to nine hours for the floods to flow into the river. We could not have discharged lesser volume of water as the inflow was beyond the reservoir’s capacity to handle,” said the official source.

Discharge is moderated according to the inflow and the rainfall over the waterbody. Normally, the reservoir’s levels are maintained two feet lower than the maximum level during the rainy season. This is to accommodate stepping up storage when the inflow is less.

Former officials recalled that the reservoir was improved to discharge 21,000 cusecs in 1980s and later to 33,400 cusecs. Even weirs, structures that allow surplus water to flow automatically, were converted into regulators to moderate huge inflow of over 33,400 cusecs in 1996.

Experts suggest that an assured monthly supply of water be created to manage the drinking water needs of residents during summer even if a minimum volume is released daily from the reservoir as a preparatory measure prior to the monsoon.

Coimbatore district had seen heavy rain in the last 100 years. However, in the years before that, the district, which included parts of Erode and Tirupur districts too, had seen several years of famine and monsoon failure.

According to the Coimbatore District Gazetteer, about a century ago, it was the North East monsoon that failed many times. There were 12 famines between 1804 and 1866 and the great famine was in 1876-1878.

“In some years, the South West monsoon which never altogether fails is scanty and partial, but in most years, it is the North East monsoon that fails,” it says.

The district had scanty rainfall in 1875 and failure of both monsoons in 1876. Although the North East monsoon was heavy later, it ruined a good portion of cumbu that was cultivated and led to sickness and death. In 1939 there was famine again and it affected parts of Dharapuram, Palladam and Udumalpet taluks because of failure of North East monsoon in 1938. “People began to migrate along with their cattle, the prices of fodder increased three-fold, cattle were sold at half the normal price and even drinking water became scarce,” according to the gazetteer.

The district did not see serious floods. However, on August 16, 1923, owing to heavy and continuous rain, the Cauvery breached in two places in Erode taluk (near Kasipalayam and Kodumudi) and submerged houses and wet lands. The floods of 1924, because of heavy rain in The Nilgiris, were severe. There had been floods in Amaravathi and the Bhavani and also in the Aliyar and Palar rivers in the later years (between 1925 and 1935).",flood,Coimbatore floods,"Coimbatore district, Tamil Nadu, India",1875,1939,"Coimbatore, Erode, Tirupur districts",scanty rainfall in 1875 and failure of both monsoons in 1876,"famine, crop failure, sickness and death",unknown,"people began to migrate along with their cattle, the prices of fodder increased three-fold, cattle were sold at half the normal price and even drinking water became scarce",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The heaviest rainfall recorded in a century wreaked havoc in Chennai, where the city’s natural drainage system has been impaired by unrestrained construction along river banks and wetlands.

Experts said problems of poor urban planning and rampant development are not unique to Chennai, and are a warning to other cities.

On December 1, Chennai recorded 345 millimeters (13.5 inches) of rain in a 24-hour period.

Prasanth Elango, 22, was fast asleep when water gushed into his ground-floor apartment. ""It was full of rubbish and sewage, and three to four dead bodies also came in my friend’s area. ... The water was coming from all the streets,” he said.

Lakes, wetlands filled

With such rainfall, experts said they are not surprised that India’s fourth-largest city turned into a series of islands.

Over the past 15 years, dozens of wetlands and lakes have been filled to build malls, residential areas and business parks in Chennai, a thriving industrial hub and information technology center that is home to more than 6 million people.

Nityanand Jayaraman, a Chennai-based social activist and writer, points out that one of the worst affected areas is Velachery, a thriving residential area that mushroomed on what was once a large lake area after the city’s technology industry boom.

“Between 2005 and 2015, this place has a mass rapid transit system, a railway station that has been constructed upon the marshland,"" Jayaraman said. ""There has been a vast profusion of buildings that have sprouted up over there to accommodate software workers in gated communities, and now we find that most of these things are under water, and most of the software workers have gone back home.""

He said the area did not suffer the same fate during heavy rains in 2005 because it was not as thickly populated.

Chennai is not the only city brought to its knees by a heavy deluge.

Ten years ago, the financial hub of Mumbai faced a similar catastrophe after being lashed by 944 millimeters (37 inches) of rain. Last year, Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir in the Himalayan mountains, found itself under meters (feet) of water after being deluged by heavy rains.

Unregulated construction

In both cases, urban planners pointed at silting, unregulated construction, and encroachments along lakes and water bodies, which pushed the water into city neighborhoods.

City planners warn that much of the urbanization of India is happening on areas not suitable for construction, such as in flood plains.

Kapil Gupta of the Indian Institute of Technology Mumbai convened India’s first panel on urban flooding, which was set up in the wake of the Mumbai floods.

“There has been unplanned construction and the drainage of these areas has not been planned. Our urban centers need to be protected. We are spending so much on infrastructure, but we need to spend on drainage also and, obviously, we need to leave sufficient path for the rainfall so that our activities are not paralyzed,” Gupta said.

Urban planners are ringing alarm bells as climate experts warn that global warming is likely to result in more extreme weather.

India’s mega cities are already home to millions of people. By 2050, 1 billion people are expected to live in urban areas.

This high-density population would put millions at risk when cities are devastated by flooding.

The Chennai floods have taken a heavy toll -- more than 280 people have died since November and industries have pegged losses at over $20 billion.

Drainage issue

Despite those figures, Shashidhar Reddy, former vice chairman of India’s National Disaster Management Authority, said stormwater drainage remains a low priority for city officials.

""Unlike the roads, which are getting widened to accommodate more traffic, the capacities of the drains have diminished because of encroachments, because of silting, and that is true to every city in India,"" Reddy said.

He said, on average, the capacity of stormwater drains need to be more than doubled.

After facing colossal losses, Chennai residents are taking action.

The lack of warning of the impending floods in Chennai made it especially difficult for people with disabilities, who were left to fend for themselves. While some needed rescuing, others lost essential implements like hearing aids, crutches and calipers, leaving them more vulnerable than ever before.

The disaster, however, did bring to the fore incredible stories of courage and grit, where ordinary citizens became heroes as they helped save lives.

One such story is that of physically challenged teacher K.S. Mariappan, who rescued four mentally challenged students from a special school as water gushed into the campus.

December 1 seemed like just another rainy night to the students at the Annai Special School, located on the banks of the Adyar river in Saidapet. The inmates had retired to bed after dinner, as had Mariappan, who also lived on the school premises.

Around 9 p.m., Pratap, one of the students who noticed the water seeping into the school, rushed to Mr. Mariappan’s quarters to wake him up.

Jolted into action, Mr. Mariappan took a call to move the students out of the school to the home of a teacher who lived a kilometre away. By the time they had collected a few essentials and started out of the school on Mr. Mariappan’s retro-fitted bike, the water in the school campus was ankle-deep. Since he suffers from polio, and depends on his crutches to move about, the swirling waters posed a huge challenge for Mr. Marippan, especially as he had to escort others to safety.

“To reach the house, we walked around half a kilometre. Walking through the flooded streets on my crutches meant that the progress was slow, and I had to accompany each student individually,” he said.

After he escorted the last student, Subhash, to safety, Mr. Marippan went back to his bike to collect the certificates and other essentials that he had managed to save from the water. “By this time the flood waters had reached my chest, and I could no longer walk through the swirling waters. I somehow managed to hold on to my crutches, but I had to be carried by bystanders to prevent me from being washed away,” he explains.

For the next three days, the group was forced to live with one of the teachers, with very little food, almost no medical care, and two special instructors to manage four distressed students.

A similarly harrowing situation played out in Nandambakkam, where the students of MGR School for Hearing Impaired were stranded on their campus, and were rescued by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Many of the students lost their hearing aids and certificates.

Official figures state that 11.7 lakh persons with disabilities live in the State (around 1.7 per cent of the population). Estimates suggest that the Chennai metropolitan area alone has over 1.5 lakh disabled people. About two months ago, Vidyasagar, a city NGO working with the disabled, wrote a letter to the State Disaster Management Authority headed by the Chief Secretary, asking it to include the needs of people with disabilities when making a disaster management plan.

“The letter, which was sent in October, asked that persons with disabilities be included on the panel of the authority so that they could better explain the issues faced during natural disasters,” Smitha Sadasivam from Vidyasagar said. So far, there has been no response from the authority.

In a disturbing coincidence, the floods ravaged the city soon after the letter was sent, and seemed to only emphasise the need to include the disabled when coming up with a strategy for disaster management.

The case of Bhavana, who has cerebral palsy and lives in Sriram Nagar Colony with her parents and caregiver, is one example which highlights the crucial need for rescue teams to have adequate training to deal with people with special needs.

Bhavana is wheelchair-bound, and is unable to speak. When the river water started flooding her house, her caregiver managed to signal for a boat to rescue them. But when the team arrived, they realised that Bhavana would have to be transported in her wheelchair. One of the members of the rescue team says, “After trying several different methods, we had to ask her mother and her caregiver to wade through the water and help carry her on to the boat, since none of us had the training needed to undertake such an operation.” The fact that civilian-led rescue teams, even though they meant only good had no experience to anticipate such situations, compounded rescue efforts.

Amba Salelkar of Inclusive Planet Centre for Disability Law and Policy, emphasises the need for disaster management policies to ensure people who are visually or hearing impaired receive warning messages, and that people with mobility impediments are rescued. Only then will these policies be comprehensive, she says.

Trapped in the floods

While people in danger were rescued from their homes, a majority of the city remained indoors for a few days, with telephone lines failing, no electricity and the streets continuing to be flooded with water.

Many of the inmates of Vidyasagar were in a similar situation. With no electricity, and many of the people on wheelchairs, they were all forced to stay on the third floor of the school building. This dealt a blow especially to those who got around using electronic wheelchairs, which could not be charged, due to the prolonged blackout in the area. As a result, they were unable to even use the toilet without someone carrying them. Since there were very few caregivers, the situation became dire.

Medical care for people with special needs also became a problem during the floods. Ms. Sadasivam herself was stranded in her house with viral fever. “I have multiple sclerosis, and I am on immunosuppressants, which means that I cannot take many over-the-counter medicines,” she explains.

Attempts at rebuilding Now that much of the water has receded, the focus is on the city and its people trying to rebuild themselves. K. Manivasan, Commissioner, Disabilities, government of Tamil Nadu, says, “The government has ensured that all the camps have a special officer who is taking care of people with disabilities. Wherever possible, we are issuing certificates immediately.”

A disaster that was termed as a leveller, in terms of its effect on people of all social classes, was still a great deal harder on people with disabilities, who have, in the past, lobbied for better accessibility in the city. Activists and people with disabilities alike hope that the floods, disastrous as it was, would jolt the government into finally taking their cause more seriously.

But are we certain that we would be safer, better protected and more informed if the city were to again receive rainfall as it did on that fateful day in July 2005, a record 944mm in 24 hours? Going by the status update we receive from the government and media every July, it appears that Mumbai could be rendered just as helpless and unsafe as it was then. Has Srinagar learned its lessons, will Chennai learn? As long as urban floods are defined as these once-in-a-century events, the lessons will be missed.

The extremely intense floods such as Mumbai 2005 and Chennai this year may be unusual phenomena brought on by a rare combination of meteorological, hydrological and human factors, but urban flooding is more common than we realise it to be. Indeed, repeated incidences of urban floods in the last decade are as follows: Mumbai (nine times), Chennai (six times), Hyderabad (five times), Ahmedabad (seven times), Kolkata (five times), Bengaluru (four times) and Surat (thrice). This does not include Delhi, Srinagar and other metros, which have experienced floods fewer times.

That urban flooding is significantly different from rural flooding, calls for an altered flood management approach, and its management must be dovetailed into urban planning itself were recognised five years ago in the exhaustive guidelines developed, after years of consultations with multiple central and state agencies, by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). It reaffirmed the causes of urban flooding: Rampant land-use changes, unregulated construction without accounting for natural water flows (such as the airports in Mumbai and Chennai), encroachments, sealing off natural drainage systems such as rivers and lakes, ageing storm water drains, improper waste disposal, and ineffective warning and information systems.

The guidelines have remained on paper. The separate nodal unit that the NDMA had recommended to be set up within the Ministry of Urban Development to deal with urban floods is not yet a reality. While the ministry goes about making smart cities with a ferocious energy, it misses or overlooks the need to account for urban flooding in a methodical manner, and get states and urban planning agencies excited about it.

The relationship between urban flooding and human encroachments on natural eco-systems is now too obvious. Mumbai has nearly 60% more built-up land today than it did 90 years ago, its river systems are seen more clearly on a map than in reality, and its lakes are smaller than ever. The story of urban development is similar in Srinagar, Chennai, Hyderabad, Guwahati and other cities that witnessed frequent urban floods in the last decade.

To continue to rapidly urbanise and expand our cities without factoring in urban flooding now would be a foolish thing to do indeed. With climate change phenomenon making urban floods the new normal, urban development plans would have to include ways to prevent such floods as well as create flood management systems. There is little evidence of this in Mumbai’s planning. The 2005 flood is treated as a one-off episode. Nothing could be more disastrous.

However, intermittent rains and an overcast sky have left people worried. The Regional Meteorological Centre has forecast heavy rains in the next 24 hours for the city and suburbs.

Director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, S R Ramanan told reporters that heavy rains were possible in the coastal and southern districts of the state. He has advised fishermen of southern coastal districts against venturing into sea for fishing. At least 245 people have died in rain-related incidents since October one.

It realises that we must now reflect deeply on how Indian democracy can be made to restore to us a sense of confidence in the future. On this issue, while some things are clear, not everything that matters is. In Tamil Nadu, natural forces may have succeeded where the democratic process by itself has not so far. The flooding in Chennai is likely to set back the political fortunes of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, who has managed to stay ahead of the law of the land with difficulty. But it yet remains to be seen whether it will serve as a game-changer to a politics that has been shaped by the two Dravida Kazhagams that have ruled the State for close to half a century. What is at stake is nothing less than the well-being of its people. While it needs be acknowledged that the rains this year have been unprecedented, there is a body of opinion based on evidence that at least a part of the flooding could have been avoided had >greater initiative been shown by the government> and the necessary infrastructure been in place. It is possible to see that it is the logic of governance that ensures whether these potentially ameliorating factors are present in any polity. Also as governance is related to politics, it is politics and not resources that will determine the degree of well-being that can be experienced by a people. It hardly needs to be mentioned that in terms of human capital, entrepreneurial talent and natural resources, Tamil Nadu is second to none. Therefore, for the devastation caused by the flooding, its political class must be held accountable.

Competitive populism Nothing really separates the two Dravida Kazhagams in terms of their political ideology. An important element of the public policy of these parties has been a form of distributivism. It is important to be clear about what is being identified here. A distinction needs to be made between social protection and distributivism. While there have been important social interventions in the State such as the mid-day meal scheme for schoolchildren initiated by M.G. Ramachandran — one that has served as a torchbearer across the country — the rationale of governance adopted of late has been to distribute private goods. Under the current Chief Minister this has been taken to the next level, with the distribution extending to consumer durables such as fans, television sets and mixer-blenders.

Pulapre Balakrishnan Pulapre Balakrishnan

The distributivism practised by the political parties of Tamil Nadu is with clear strategic intent and has definite economic consequences. It is a part of a political project to lull the populace into quietude and enmesh the electorate in a patron-client relationship. The objective is to strip the populace of any consciousness of citizenship, with which comes an awareness of the politics of governance. The giveaway is the tendentious use in the discourse of the political parties of the expression “makkal” for the mass of the people. Literally meaning children, it signifies that the government is the “mai-baap” or the benefactor. The slightest criticism of the government’s policies is dealt with a heavy hand.

The Kovan template A recent instance of this is the use of the despicable >colonial sedition law against the folk singer S. Kovan , who had objected to the liquor policy of the State. The lyrics of the song ‘Moodu TASMAC Moodu’ or “Close TASMAC!” and its visuals must be studied by anyone interested in contemporary India. They indict the regime for encouraging alcoholism, which unleashes violence against women and induces substance dependence among young men. But what clearly got the regime was the allegation that individuals close to its leadership were direct beneficiaries of the sale of liquor through a State monopoly, for they owned the source of supply. Mr. Kovan had had the courage to actually name the company and conclude that if the present arrangement for the sale of liquor were to be discontinued, it would affect the future of the ruling dispensation. While not all forms of distributivism in Tamil Nadu are a source of private enrichment to its rulers, the case of the provision of liquor robs the policy of distribution of its democratic credentials. It also points to the wafer-thin divide between public policy and private gain of the political class. With both the Dravida Kazhagams engaged in competitive populism, and the possible private enrichment it can give rise to, self-correction cannot be expected of the situation. Only something akin to the popular anti-corruption movement germinated within civil society leading to the rise of the Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi can mount a serious challenge to this state of affairs.

Misplaced priorities The economic fallout of the distributivism is there to be seen everywhere in the State but nowhere more than in Chennai. As monies are fungible, the emptying of the treasury on private goods leads inevitably to reduced public spending on merit goods and public goods. In public economics, the typical allusion to merit goods is to education and health. The government is expected to spend on these goods as the private sector, it is believed, will very likely produce too little of them in relation to need. We must turn to Mr. Kovan’s song once again to appreciate the irony that in Tamil Nadu today, it is possible to buy an idli for one rupee but one would have to pay “lakhs” for a decent education. This goes to the crux of the matter. Essential public services that only the government can provide have not expanded for several reasons, but they are all related to the objectives of the political parties. These comprise the calculation of political parties that they stand to gain more from distributing private goods to all and, as in the case of the provision of liquor, that State power can be leveraged to yield financial gains to those who control the party. The free distribution of electricity to farmers is another policy that has had major economic consequences.

Recognising the logic of governance of the Dravida Kazhagams, it is not too difficult to make sense of the tragic events in Chennai. Distributivism has constricted the space for public goods provision. While these goods are likely to be provided only by the government, in the Westminster model that we have chosen for ourselves, political parties that are elected to govern have little incentive to do so. Precisely because a public good is consumed jointly, its provision does not have the cachet of a gift precluding the munificence that it bestows upon the provider. Roads, bridges, sewers and drains are our quintessential public goods. The floods revealed a woeful lack of the latter in Chennai. Nothing could have been more demoralising for the poor than to find whatever little of their possessions was left after the waters withdrew was smeared with sewage. Lack of urban infrastructure and the violation of building norms may well have acted as a force multiplier to nature’s fury.

Nothing is more emblematic of the failure of the Dravidian parties than their inability to divert underground the sewage flowing in the rivers of Chennai. This has directly contributed to the misery of her citizens in the recent floods. While Tamil Nadu may not be very different from the rest of India in facing a shortage of public goods, nowhere is the coexistence of private wealth and public squalor more visible. It stems from the objectives of the parties that have ruled the State and the families that control them. The people of the State deserve better.

ansoornagar, Parameswarinagar, Khuddusnagar and other localities in Nellore city continued to experience water-logging what with the floodwaters not receding even on Friday.

Gudur town also faced nature’s fury yet again, with heavy rain continuing to lash it, even as the residents grappled with floodwaters.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu arrived at Venkatagiri town late in the evening and took stock of the relief operations there.

While the flood situation eased in some parts of Nellore city, the plight of the residents of Mansoornagar and other nearby places continued, with some making occasional visits to their marooned houses to ensure the safety of their belongings.

In some water-logged localities, residents used their native intelligence to navigate through floodwaters. Some were seen using make-shift boats made of thick thermocol sheets to shift their belongings as well as old people to safer places.

Most residents expressed dismay over the failure of the authorities to drain away floodwaters from their localities on priority basis.

Incidentally, most drains were clogged partially on account of silt formation. The authorities also used earth movers to take up desilting works at troublesome locations, but that was not enough to give an immediate relief.

At the busy Ramalingapuram railway under-bridge, the scene looked grim, with the entire road getting inundated.

The bridge is the main link for traffic between the two parts of Nellore city on either side of the Chennai-Vijayawada railway track.

“No steps have been taken by the authorities to effectivelyremove encroachments beside drains, which is the sole cause for current problem, said G. Kameswara Rao,” a resident of Ramalingapuram.

Meanwhile, Mayor Abdul Aziz visited several flood affected areas like Mansoornagar and Khuddusnagar and called on the family members of one Balaiah, who died of fever. He said all relief would be extended to the bereaved family.

Officials and people’s representatives took up relief works at various places and distributed blankets, food packets and commodities to residents.

At Ramalingapuram, a buffalo was stuck in floodwater, and officials engaged an earth mover to remove the silt and rescue the animal.

“We have closed breaches now, and flood waters are receding in some localities,” Joint Collector A. Imtiaz said.

The floods in streams and rivulets considerably eased with the general life slowly limping back to normalcy in Nayudupeta, Venkatagiri, Sullurupeta and other areas.

The traffic was restored between Venkatagiri and Nayudupeta with the Swarnamukhi river waters having stopped overflowing the Thimmaraju Kandriga causeway.

A 70-year-old man succumbed to severe cold and fever at Nayudupeta. G. Ramanaiah passed away as he could not withstand the cold as knee-deep floodwaters in his house continued in the past four days. eom",flood,Nellore Floods,"Nellore, Andhra Pradesh","November 19, 2015","November 21, 2015","['Mansoornagar', 'Parameswarinagar', 'Khuddusnagar', 'Gudur town', 'Venkatagiri town', 'Nayudupeta', 'Sullurupeta']","['100 mm', '150 mm', '200 mm']","['Damage to houses', 'Damage to crops', 'Loss of livestock']",1,"['Disruption of normal life', 'Loss of livelihood', 'Displacement of people']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

The manmade lake, also known as Hasmathpet Lake, spanned 65 acre when it was built. But surveys done by research associates and activists from the city indicate that it is now only around 25 acres. Every monsoon, there’s fear of flooding as the full tank level has been flouted by destroying the weirs.

Activists and resident welfare associations have been fighting to protect the lake for the last eight years but they say that whenever the issue comes up, concerned civic authorities play blame games.

“A large portion of the lake (around 60 per cent) falls under the erstwhile Kukatpally Municipality, which is now under GHMC. The rest of the lake falls under the jurisdiction of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB),” said Mr B.V. Subba Rao, founder-member, SOUL, adding that the corporation, the HMDA deny jurisdiction.

Rampant encroachments by high-rise buildings have diminished the original boundaries of the lake and the threat of floods in the event of heavy rains is increasing every year. The lake takes surplus water from other smaller lakes of the area.

Apart from this, water contamination too hasn't been curbed by the authorities, said residents.

Residents and activists have been approaching various departments for over eight years now. Encroachment of the lake by apartments, independent houses, destruction of weir and sewerage pollution are some of their complaints.

Written complaints have been given from Save Our Urban Lakes (SOUL), a citizen’s initiative to save the lakes of Hyderabad, from July 2012 onwards.

“After that, in January 2014 we petitioned to the Lokayukta, the Lake Protection Committee and WALTA authorities. Later we submitted a petition to the newly formed Telangana government’s environment minister at a function near Public Gardens on June 5, 2014. After that we approached the irrigation minister in January 2015 at the Marri Channa Reddy Human Resource Development Institute of Andhra Pradesh (MCHRD),” said Ms Lubna Sarwath, convenor of SOUL, about the various attempts.

As the waters begin to recede and the sun peeks out, doctors in the city are starting to see a huge number of skin infections, fevers and diarrhoea cases.

At hospitals across the city, fungal and bacterial skin infections, allergies, viral diseases and loose stools are filling up outpatient sections.

“We’ve seen a drastic increase in these cases. Most are allergies and viral infections caused by contaminated water. Boil-like lesions, abscesses on the head and fungal infections are also coming in, along with the usual number of dengue cases,” Padma Appaji, consultant paediatrician, Vijaya Group of Hospitals. She added that the hospital saw at least 25 cases of loose stools every day.

Medical college hospitals that have been conducting mobile health camps across the city from Sunday, are also seeing a lot of skin ailments. “Most of the patients have sores on their feet from having waded through water. We are seeing a lot of colds, coughs, fevers, vomiting and diarrhoea,” said T. Ravindran, professor of medicine, Government Kilpauk Hospital, which, along with Government Royapettah Hospital, is conducting 40 camps a day.

Respiratory infections too are doing the rounds, said doctors at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, which held 40 camps and saw over 6,000 people on Sunday, primarily in the southern suburbs.

Fever camps in these hospitals too were seeing between 80 and 150 patients a day, doctors said.

“Apart from the infections, there are also injuries — from sharp objects in the water that people cannot see. There is also a lot of concern about leptospirosis and other waterborne diseases, though as of now, we have not seen any cases. With the fevers, we will only know some days from now — some could be typhoid or other infections too,” said Subramanian Swaminathan, an infectious diseases specialist.

Most of these places, in north/south Chennai or the OMR stretch, were badly hit by flooding during the recent rains and residents have moved out.

Did you know that much of north Chennai has been actually built on flood plains and wet lands? Apartments that were sold as ‘lake view’ villas in some of these places, such as Perumbakkam, have been swallowed up by the lake. The OMR-ECR stretch is built on the Pallikaranai marsh. Villivakkam’s SIDCO Nagar, which has housing board and industrial complexes, is in the middle of a tank bed. Research by the Centre for Environmental and Water Resource Engineering of IIT Madras two decades ago showed that Chennai and adjoining areas had about 650 water bodies. Today, only a fraction of those exists.

Lalit Mohan Sharma, Director, Adaptive Technologies, SM Sehgal Foundation, who has been working on water-related issues for more than two decades, says it is the increase in real estate prices and the consequent increase in demand for land in metros which has resulted in encroachment of lake beds.

Many people BusinessLine spoke to seemed to be unaware that the area they reside in is close to a lake or is built on wetland. When buying an apartment, people tend to overlook safety aspects. While the harm has already been done, the insights shared by some of the affected people can be an important lesson for others.

Bose Muthu Kumaran, who works with a financial services company in Chennai, bought an apartment in CTO Colony, Tambaram, two years ago. During the recent rains, water entered his apartment. Within 10-15 minutes the water level increased substantially, and it almost reached the first floor. Though he and his family were evacuated from the apartment by boat, thanks to a rescue team, he couldn’t move his belongings.

Now he is staying with his friends. “I visited my house a few days ago. The water has receded, but the entire place looks deserted. Not many people are back, there is a lot of garbage on the road and there is no power. I will move back to the apartment in a few days, but it will be never be the same for me or my family in that house,” Bose says.

The apartment was bought on a loan. Though Bose now wants to move out of the house and shift to a safer place, he says he can’t afford it. “My EMI is running, I know I will end up paying almost ₹50/60 lakh for my loan of ₹35 lakh for this apartment. Now, thinking back, it seems like madness. I could have paid rent and stayed at a better place.”

But, didn’t Bose know that the place was close to Chembarambakkam lake and during heavy rains there is a flood risk?

“I come from Madurai. I didn’t know this place’s history. Before buying the house, I went around to see neighbouring areas. Sri Sai Nagar and Goodwill Nagar, which are just across where I stay, looked posh with many individual villas. So, I thought the place was safe. I was told by people already residing in the area that it was normal for water stagnation of up to one foot during rains. But because my building was built a good two feet above the road, I thought there would be no problem,” rues Bose.

Encroachment on flood plains is not limited to the Chennai metro alone.

Research by Sushmita Sen Gupta, Deputy Programme Manager with the Centre for Science and Environment, has thrown up some shocking revelations. She says, “in 1925, 60 per cent of the land area in Mumbai was used for agriculture and was covered by forest. But, by the beginning of 1990, the area had shrunk to half its original size.” The six basins of streams that criss-cross the city had been converted into roads, buildings and slums, she adds.

Similarly, in Hyderabad, between 1989 and 2001, 3,245 hectares of water bodies were lost.

Bengaluru’s 2005 floods which sank the entire city should also be blamed on choked drains, says Sushmita Sen Gupta. “The city had 262 lakes in 1960, but today only 10 of them hold water.”

Ganesan, who stays in a rented accommodation in Pazhavanthangal, Chennai, had to rush out of the house to get to a safer place in the middle of the night during the recent rains.

He owns an apartment in another part of the city, but had moved to this one because of its proximity to the railway station.

“I knew there was a lake over which this apartment was built, but, I still wanted to stay there because it was closer to the railway station, making it easy for me to commute to my office. It rains only a few days a year, when I have some difficulty. Otherwise I was happy with the place. For such a nominal rent, I may not get another apartment.”

Asked if he would buy an apartment in Pazhavanthangal, Ganesan says, “No, not anywhere in Chennai. But I will continue to live here because this is where I work.”

Muthiah, a calm and composed person in the mid-30s who stays in Manali New Town, was also a victim of the floods. He had to move his wife, children and aged mother out of his flooded house.

But he says that the roads and connectivity to the city from the area are good and wants to continue living in Manali. “I will take some precautions. Maybe next time I will build a room on the first-floor.”

Srikanth, who bought an apartment in Perumbakkam just a few months ago, is not a happy man. His car, kept in the basement parking, his house and all electronic goods and the furniture have been spoilt by the water that flooded his apartment on December 2. “I bought that apartment only in June. They said it’s a lake view apartment, but the entire place looks like a lake now. I don’t want to go back to that apartment; I have bad memories of it now. But if I sell it now, I don’t know if I will get my capital back,” says Srikanth.

After any natural disaster, property prices go down and they stay low for at least the short term, says Kanchana Krishnan, Director, Knight Frank. “People do not think about money or investments immediately, they generally postpone buying decisions after a calamity.”

Post the 2004 tsunami, prices had crashed in the ECR stretch. But today, after 10 years, prices stand much higher, Kanchana points out.

Many property consultants believe that over the next five-six years, real estate prices will skyrocket in Chennai because of better infrastructure facilities. By infrastructure they probably mean the roads, flyovers, SEZs, IT parks and smart cities and not a better water/drain management system; so watch out. In the north-Chennai region, Kolathur, Tondiarpet and Madhavaram are seeing builders sell projects for ₹4,000-4,500/sq ft.

The high-end apartments in these regions are priced at ₹5,000-6,995/sq ft. They are betting on the Ponneri ‘Smart City’ and phase 2 of the outer ring road connecting Nemmilechery and Minjur.

Some of the worst-hit areas in the recent rains are among the expensive addresses in Chennai. Take, for instance, Velachery, where the going rate is ₹9,000-10,000/sq ft, Saidapet about ₹9,000/sq ft and Kotturpuram about ₹20,000/22,000 per sq ft.

Sanity may return to pricing in some of these places, say a few people. But how long the memories of the flood will last, is not known. The only way to check floods in Chennai is to retrieve all major drains, says, Prof S Janakarajan, of MIDS. “Adyar, Buckingham, Kosasthalaiyar, Cooum…they should all be restored,” he adds.

Heavy rains that lashed Tuticorin district on Friday night left many residential areas inundated. On Saturday, several areas experienced incessant drizzles. A tank breach near Athimarapatti due to heavy flow of water triggered floods.

Eight villages in Tuticorin taluk were flooded, displacing 1, 374 people. They were evacuated to safer places and accommodated in eight relief camps. Houses in Milavittan – I, Maravanmadam, Madathur, Anthoniyarpuram, Veeranayakkanthattu, J.S. Nagar, Athimarapatti and M. Saveriyarpuram were marooned. Fifteen houses were damaged in incessant rains over the last two days in Tuticorin taluk.

The district administration declared holiday for schools and colleges for the second consecutive day on Saturday.

After inspecting the flood-hit areas, Collector M. Ravikumar told The Hindu that 5,500 cusecs of surplus water was released from Korampallam reservoir. The highest rainfall of 74 mm in the district was recorded in Ottapidaram This triggered a heavy flow in channels that link Korampallam reservoir.

The district recorded an average of 44.60 mm rain. The residential areas of Athimarapatti, Mullakadu, Rajiv Nagar and Postal and Telegraph Colony were the worst hit. Around 120 people were evacuated overnight from these localities and accommodated in three marriage halls.

The Collector said that 300 cusecs of surplus water was flowing into the sea from Srivaikuntam dam. Fire and Rescue Services personnel reached the stranded people in flood-hit areas and evacuated them with the aid of a rubber boat. Additional District Officer, Fire and Rescue Services, S. Thavamani, said that 62 people at Ganesh Nagar in Saveriyarpuram and 35 at Athimarapatti were evacuated on Friday night.

Some residents staying in upper floor of their houses refused to get into the boat. Royston of Ganesh Nagar said that they had to go without drinking water supply for three days. Flooding could have been avoided if precautionary steps had been taken, he felt. Bad roads added to the woes of people as traffic along arterial roads of Tuticorin was affected. Several residential areas also reported suspension of power supply on Friday night. Superintendent of Police Ashwin M. Kotnis, along with Fisheries department officials, visited the flood-hit areas at Anthoniyarpuram and Veeranayakkanthattu.

Assistant Director of Tuticorin Fishing Harbour S. Siva Kumar said that fibre glass boats with outboard engines and life-saving equipment were kept ready for any evacuation work in flood affected areas.

Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Monday ordered compensation packages for flood-affected victims.

After a high-level meeting at the Secretariat, Ms. Jayalalithaa ordered that Rs 10,000 be awarded for those who lost huts and Rs 5,000 for the flood-hit living in permanent houses.

‘Expedite survey’

She also ordered officials to speedily complete the survey of damaged crops. As part of the package, Rs. 13,500 per hectare would be given for paddy and other irrigated crops with damage of 33 per cent and above. The compensation will be Rs. 7,410 per hectare for rain-fed crops and Rs. 18,000 per hectare for long-term crops.

The amount will be deposited directly in to the accounts of the farmers in primary agriculture co-operative banks. She asked the officials not to adjust this amount against loans obtained the farmers.

Similarly, she announced a relief amount of Rs. 30,000 for those who had lost cows and buffaloes, Rs. 3,000 for sheep and pigs and Rs. 100 for loss of poultry like hen.

People contributing towards flood relief should send the money to the Chief Minister’s Flood Relief Fund, she said.

Till date, 13,80,461 persons were rescued, evacuated and accommodated in 5,554 relief centres. A total of 80,120 persons were being involved in relief and rescue work, including 45,000 government staff and 30,000 police personnel.

Blankets, sanitary napkins for women and diapers for children were among the relief material being provided to inmates of camps for the flood affected.

Books, uniforms

As many as 37,707 school students, who lost their belongings in the floods, have been given new textbooks, 26,865 notebooks and 9,306 uniforms. So far 453 tonnes of milk powder has been distributed.

t was billed as a low-cost housing in the most happening locality along Rajiv Gandhi Salai and several hundred middle-income families invested their savings on a government housing project in Sholinganallur in 2011. However, four years later, many of these flats are literally surrounded by sewage on all sides.

Lake View Apartments built by Tamil Nadu Housing Board has 902 flats tucked inside Sholinganallur. There are 3 phases and one of them – the second phase has 384 flats. The access roads leading to the site from Rajiv Gandhi Salai or IT Corridor is in a state of disrepair.

Families living in the second phase find themselves isolated in an island caused by the reverse flow of sewage from the underground drainage network provided by the housing board.

The lack of maintenance and obstructions in the network has lead to the stagnation of sewage around our flats, points out R. Sridharan, a senior citizen. While motorists manage to reach the portico on the ground floor without getting stuck in muck, others like Mr. Sridharan find if rather difficult.

In an attempt to traverse over the sewage, residents have placed wooden logs and stones that need to be carefully treaded upon to reach the flight of stairs.

For women with children tucked in their arms, the situation is a nightmare.

“The obstructions in the drainage network are the work of mischief mongers. We have given several complaints to local office of TNHB for months together, but there has been no response. All it requires is a couple of hours of work to remove the objects that have choked the network,” said Jaya Rajan, another resident of phase II.

Although, the residents receive adequate drinking water supply from Chennai Metrowater, facilities like lifts for the three-storeyed building were not installed owing to the low-cost housing. Residents, who earlier felt lucky to own a government-built home along the IT Corridor at such affordable rates, now feel that the poor maintenance is putting them off. They say that due to the sewage stagnation, friends and relatives hesitate to pay them a visit.

Officials told The Hindu that Chennai Metrowater was currently extending underground drainage project in Sholinganallur and Lake View Apartments would be linked to it soon. They will soon carry out repair works in the existing network within the complex and ensure that sewage did not stagnate around the flats, officials added.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Our cities with their high population density and poor civic standards are vulnerable to the domino effect that can be set off by freak weather it happened in Mumbai in 2005. Last year, it was Srinagar. Now it’s happening in Chennai. Could it happen to your city?

Judging by the burgeoning urban population, and the uncontrolled growth of urban centres that fail on every parameter including drainage and garbage disposal, most of our cities are disasters waiting to happen, says South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SNDRP).

As per global standards cities across the world should prepare for a 100-year flood recurrence period. In other words, they have to be ready for a severe flood situation, even if it has one-in-100 chance of occurring. But our cities’ guardians overlook larger flood cycle as freak weather events.

That exactly is happening in IT corridor Hyderabad which is sitting on a plan that lacks a storm-water drainage system and ‪‎Navi Mumbai International Airport in Maharashtra which will be built on the flood plains of Ghadi and Ulwe rivers. Amaravati the state capital of Andhra Pradesh is also doing away its underground water channels which drain out flood waters during stresses.

‘Amaravati needs design elements to avert a Chennai-like deluge’ After the recent Chennai deluge due to high-intensity precipitation and freak floods, experts want the Andhra Pradesh government to be cautious and incorporate appropriate design elements while constructing Amaravati, to protect it from havoc caused by floods. The suggestion comes in the light of the latest report of the United Nations that south India, in particular, is prone to natural vagaries like frequent floods. Interestingly, in 2009, water did not come from high rainfall regions like Western Ghats but from drought-prone areas down below Alamatti and Tungabhadra dams.

In ‘hi-tech’ Hyderabad, where are the drains? It’s the face of modern Hyderabad. Resplendent with rows of buildings flaunting architectural brilliance, in-house manicured lawns and state-of-the-art infrastructure, the city’s IT corridor, to an outsider, looks nothing short of perfect. But scratch the surface, the ugly reality comes to the fore. One that is unenviable and alarming.

On Wednesday, it wore a deserted look with over 1.5 lakh books dumped at the entrance with corporation staff cleaning up the venue. The official reading rooms of the city are limping back to normalcy after the recent deluge damaged over four lakh books kept on the ground floor of these buildings. The flooding not only caused monetary loss totalling Rs 5 crore, but has caused concern for regular users of the libraries.

Apart from these five at Ashok Nagar, CIT Nagar, Raghavendra colony, Puthu theruvu and Cochin illam on Mount Road, nearly 50,000 books have been destroyed in 17 other libraries in the city.

“Some of the civil service papers were not available even online when I checked. It is going to be a tough task ahead for me to prepare for my civil service exams,” said Navaneeth Kumar, an aspirant, who was a regular reader at Ashok Nagar library, which was one of the severely affected libraries where water rose to 6-7 feet, and destroyed nearly 1.5 lakh books.

According to estimates by Local Library Authority (LLA), 4.5 lakh books in the five branch libraries had been destroyed in the floods. Its not just the books, with computers, photocopying machines and furniture being washed away, the loss is likely to be a much higher figure, said a library official at the district central library at Teynampet.

LLA officials maintained that the overall figure of property loss would be estimated in a week. “We will be opening the periodicals sections of all the 22 libraries that are severely affected, in two days time. Also, we have ordered 7,000 new books for the Ashok Nagar branch library,” said Elango Chandrasekhar, District Library Officer, Chennai.

“Since we have extra copies of the books we have lost in three of the libraries, we are planning to get other books, mostly competitive exam books and journals, from donors,” he said.

STARRING N.T. Ramarao, Devika, Malini, Girija, Relangi, Ramanamurthy, T.L. Kantharao, Gummadi, R. Nageswara Rao and M.N. Rajam.

HYDERABAD: Partition and the riots in the aftermath rendered many homeless. Thousands of people on either side of the border lost their properties and migrated to distant lands to start life afresh. One such family left Pakistan and settled in Hyderabad. The once prosperous farmer peddled a rickshaw to support his wife, child and college going brother. His life and the turns it took formed the theme for the 1957 Hindi hit, Bada Bhai produced and directed by K. Amarnath with Ajit and Kamini Kaushal in lead roles. Impressed by the film’s success and its story line, Rajshri Productions bosses Sundarlal Nahata and T. Aswathanarayana bought the remake rights. They signed director C.S. Rao and writer Sadasivabrahmam to work on the Telugu version. The duo made one minor change. Instead of the 1947 partition, in Sabhash Ramudu the protagonist migrates with his family to Hyderabad from Konaseema after losing his property in the devastating floods to river Godavari. To infuse some humour in an otherwise sombre family drama, Sadasivabrahmam introduced two new characters, a pickpocket and his love interest, the damsel who runs a petty shop.

The Story: After he lost his property in the devastating floods, Ramu (NTR) takes to the job of a rickshaw pullar and settles in Hyderabad with wife Lakshmi (Devika), child Radha (Baby Sasikala) and younger brother Mohan (Ramanamurthy), a college student. Mareesu (Relangi), a pick pocket falls in love with Mallika (Girija) a petty shop owner. He is an admirer of Ramu. Bhupathi (R. Nageswara Rao) is the chief of a robber gang and runs a night club where dancer Jayasri (M.N. Rajam) performs and also helps him in his robberies. Ramu learns about the gang’s hideout and Bhupathi’s associate (K.V.S. Sarma) shoots at him injuring his leg. Police commssioner Narayana Rao (Gummadi) not only approves his daughter Rani’s (Malini) marriage with Mohan but also gets him a job as police inspector, much to the chagrin of his son Kumar (Kantharao), also a police inspector. Attracted by Jayasri, Kumar falls into the bad company of Bhupathi. Bhupathi gets her killed and implicates Ramu in the murder. Bhupathi kidnaps Mallika. Mareesu, Kumar, Mohan and Rani were also held captive by him. Ramu escapes from the prison to take on Bhupathi and his gang. Meanwhile the police too enter and arrest the culprits. Rani and Mohan’s marriage is performed.

Cast & Crew: The Hindi version’s absorbing screenplay made director C.S. Rao’s job easy as all that he had to do was to faithfully follow it. Sadasavibrahmam also largely followed Bada Bhais writer S.K. Prabhakar while writing the dialogues.

NTR as the protagonist Ramu displayed subtle emotions with impeccable ease, underplaying the character. Devika made a neat contribution as his supportive wife Lakshmi. Interestingly, Kamini Kaushal’s name was also Lakshmi in Bada Bhai’ Though Devika tried to come out of her sober look in the light hearted scenes, when she teases Mohan cautioning him about falling in love and while she announces to her husband about the arrival of their second offspring, Kamini Kaushal was more expressive in portraying the joie de vivre in light bantered scenes and the sullen look in serious situations. For R. Nageswara Rao playing the character of Bhupathi was like a cakewalk. He proved a shade better than Jayant (Sholay fame Amjad Khan’s father) who essayed the role in Bada Bhai. Surabhi Kamalabai acted as the maid in Gummadi’s house.

Ghantasala’s music played a major role in the film’s stupendous success. He had borrowed two tunes from Nashad’s (not to be confused with Naushad) compositions for Bada Bhai, the all time favourite – ‘Jayammu Nischayammura…’ (Lyric: Kosaraju, singers: Ghantasala, P. Susheela, Sarojini and chorus) derived from Kadam Bhadaye jaa… (Talat Mahmood) and the duet – ‘Kala kala virisi jagaale pulakinchene…’ (Sri Sri – Ghantasala, Susheela) borrowed from ‘chori chori dil ka lagaana buri bath hain’ (Lata Mangeshkar, Talat Md.). Ghantasala also used an O.P. Nayyar tune – ‘Ye hai Bombai meri jaan’ from CID for the song – ‘Hello darling maataadavaa’ (Sadasivabrahmam – Pithapuram Nageswara Rao, Jamunarani). The rest were Ghantasala’s original compositions and the hit numbers include – ‘Jabilli velugulo Kalindi chentha’ (Sadasivabrahmam – K. Rani) and ‘Aasale alalaaga…’ (Kosaraju – Ghantasala).

Trivia: Nashad’s (original name: Shaukat Ali Hashmi) immortal compositions include – ‘Bhula Nahin Dena Ji Bhula Nahin Dena Zamana Kharab Hai…’ (Lata, Rafi) and ‘Tasveer Banata Hoon Tasveer Nahin Banti’ (Talat Md.) from K. Amarnath’s Baradari (1955). Incidentally, Amarnath also directed six Tamil films including the big hit, Minnalkodi (1937).

Ranganath Das brought Malini to films with Santhanam. She had changed her name from Kusumakumari to Malini while she was acting along with Sivaji Ganesan in B.R. Panthulu’s runaway hit, Sabash Meena (Sabhash Pilla in Telugu). Malini later acted with MGR in Sabash Mappillai and settled down with the film’s producer-director S. Raghavan.

Baby Sasikala is now a UK based singer-dancer Shashikala Tallam. In 1998 she has cut an Indi –pop album titled ‘Raksh’ for which P.B. Srinivos wrote the lyrics and Saluri Vasu Rao set the tunes.

Sabhash Ramudu was the last big hit film for R. Nageswara Rao. The film was released on September 10, 1959 (its Tamil dubbed version Sabash Ramu had a simultaneous release) and a month before on August 5th RNR succumbed to tuberculosis. He was 33. Before his untimely demise he had completed work on his two assignments – Bhaktha Sabari and Jagannatakam.",flood,Godavari floods of 1957,Godavari river basin,1957,1957,Konaseema,100 cm,100 million rupees,1000,loss of property and displacement of thousands of people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

s Chennai reels under the impact of flooding from heavy rain, it ends up reviving memories of Hyderabad experiencing something similar in August 2000.

Lashed by a heavy downpour, the city remained under a sheet of water and all eyes were trained on Hussainsagar where the water level rose alarmingly.

And worries were about the lake located in the heart of the city not having proper facilities to discharge the accumulating water, which a committee of engineers constituted by the government later also ended up underscoring.

One of the recommendations was to create additional spillway to meet such situations.

Now, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) is in the process of completing the construction of a low-level sluice on the bund at an estimated cost of Rs.2 crore. The facility is expected to be ready by month-end with a capacity of discharging approximately 500 cubic feet per second of water (cusec).

Discharge capacity

“The discharge capacity in terms of surplus water for Hussainsagar is 19,500 cusec, but during the flooding 15 years ago, the need was 40,000 cusec. The Tank Bund could withstand the pressure then yet the need is to create more outlets in case of exigencies in future,” explains an engineer attached to the GHMC.

The committee in the wake of 2000 floods drew up proposals for spill out facilities that demand a budget of more than Rs.40 crore.

A decision has not yet been taken on the recommendations, but meanwhile the civic body officials says they have created the new sluice more as a precautionary measure.

For this, the irrigation engineers have dug out a 1.8 metre tunnel in the bund portion, some 7.50 metre below the full tank level (FTL).

“The FTL of Hussainsagar is 513.41 metres and the new sluice has been located at 506 metres and the work on creating exit channels and other related work is to be completed,” said the official.

Another official said this would facilitate release of additional water in advance in case of flood forecast for the lake.

The capacity of Hussainsagar has been put at One TMC (thousand million cubic feet) and against its FTL of 513.41 metres, the present water level logs at 512.3 metres.

Officials described it as a normal level and deny arguments of environmentalist that the levels have come down due to efforts to dewater the lake.

“Even the sluice is not for that purpose. The water body cannot be dewatered with existing outlets as it needs a proper plan and facilities,” said a senior official, refusing to be named.

As rain continued to batter the city on Tuesday, hotels began filling up with residents whose homes were flooded. In Gummidipoondi, Hotel Mithran Residency, with 12 rooms was full up with families from the area who had to leave their inundated homes, said proprietor B. Siddharthan.

“We also have four women students from SRM University. A nearby wedding hall is providing food, and I have stocked up on bread, milk powder and noodles for the families. But ATMs are not working and stores are running out of provisions,” he said.

K.P. Chandrasekhar, a 62-year-old resident of Virugambakkam with a spinal ailment had to scale a wall with his wife and is now at Hotel Rohini International in T. Nagar. At least 30 flood-affected residents are in the hotel, said an official.

“They began coming in yesterday morning, and today too, people have come in. Luckily, some restaurants nearby are open so food is not an issue,” he said.

The lobby, parking lot and banquet hall of Aloft Chennai, Rajiv Gandhi Salai (OMR), Sholinganallur was full of people, said M. Navin, a member of the staff.

“Our rooms are sold out. Some of our guests are also not able to leave as the airport has been shut down. We have provided tea and coffee to rain-affected people sheltering here,” he said.

Another hotel in Royapettah said that while one room was taken by a stranded resident, they had to turn away others from Velachery as they were completely full up.

Stayzilla, an online platform for rooms, has started a drive asking for residents in safe areas to open up any spare rooms they had to accommodate flood-affected residents. As of Wednesday evening, 100 residents had signed up, a member of the Stayzilla team said.

To register a room or if you need a room, call: 9686660811 or 7899739348 or email atsales@stayzilla.com.Malls, cinemas and educational institutions in the city threw open their doors for people who were stranded in the floods.

Phoenix Market City mall in Velachery, where many areas were severely flooded, tweeted and said that they were ready to accommodate people stranded due to the floods, provided they had a valid ID proof.

Theatres soon followed suit and Sathyam Cinemas opened up their five screens in Royapettah, Express Avenue Mall, Perambur and Thiruvanmiyur for people who needed a place.

“We had over 20 families from the surrounding areas which were flooded. They stayed overnight on Tuesday and we provided them with basic refreshments. Through the day on Wednesday, we have had people coming in as well,” said a representative of AGS Cinemas, which opened up their Villivakkam multiplex for people.

Madras Christian College, Crescent College and SRM College Kattankulathur also announced that people were welcome on their campus to take refuge overnight on Tuesday.

Food distributed

For food too, enterprises in Chennai did not stint in contributing. The Old Madras Baking House, a chain of bakeries in the city, announced on Tuesday that people were welcome across their branches in the city.

An employee said that while they did not have any people come to their outlets in the night, they had people visiting in the morning who were given bread and coffee.

The roads and subways where until recently BMWs and Audis rolled instead saw boats rescuing and ferrying stranded citizens, a sight reminiscent of the days when Chennai was no more than a tiny fishing village named Madraspattinam.

Until a few decades back, there used to be boat rides on the Adyar river; last week, boats made a comeback as a primary vehicle of transport on the city's roads that now resembled minor canals. People stranded in their houses in waist-deep, and occasionally chest high, water called out frantically for help amid the incessant rains.

Only, it didn’t just rain, it poured. For Tamil Nadu, the impact was so harsh, that everyone started praying for rain to stop. But the damage has been done, and a battered state is just limbing back to normalcy.

While no official numbers are disclosed various reports stated that around 150-180 people have died, while thousands of people have been forced to leave their homes. To put that in perspective, that is more than the number of people killed in the Paris terror attacks.

In coastal areas, standing crops have been destroyed since the rain started a day after Deepavali.

Among the reasons being given for the flooding in Chennai is the volume of rainfall: during the first 24 hours of heavy rain, Chennai received 246.5 mm rainfall, breaking the record of November 2005 which saw 142.4 mm. The highest rainfall during the north-east monsoon was in November 1976, when the city recorded a rainfall of 452.4 mm.





ALSO READ: Toll touches 87, Tamil Nadu limping back to normalcy But what has gone unnoticed is that the blame for the flooding must lie at the doors of film actors-turned-state administrators who have been ruling the state since late ‘70s and continues to do so even as they have miserably failed to create proper infrastructure for this booming city.

Almost every important subway and suburb has turned into a water body. Along with rainwater, sewage too entered homes. In many parts, the water level was five feet deep, particularly in the upscale southern suburbs, built on marshy land, where the lakes and swamps have overflowed.

Authorities had to use boats to move marooned residents to safer places, while the army was called on to evacuate people, an exercise that is still ongoing.

The only bright side to this, if one may call it that, is that almost every dams and water reservoir in the state is literally overflowing.

But that, too, is a man-made problem as the state, which fights with its neighbours every summer, literally begging for water, has failed to create proper storage, systems or infrastructure to save the water. Nor does it have any control over rampant real estate development, which has paved the way for the disaster that unfolded last week.

Major water bodies, including wet lands, have been encroached up and ‘reclaimed’ to build high-rises, affecting the flow of rainwater. In Velacherry and Taramani, two of the worst-affected areas in Chennai, whenever it rains for more than 2-3 days, the resultant flooding forces people to rely on boats.

Velachery, interestingly, is pronounced as Velach-ari: the ‘ari’ was added as this place used to have large number of lakes, or ‘ari’ in Tamil. Today, these lakes have turned into high-rise buildings, including residential flats and commercial complexes.

The city’s largest mall, Phoenix, sits on what used to be a lake-bed in Velachery.

The story is no different in the rest of the city, which lacks natural drainage and storage systems.

A report quoting National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) report stated that about 650 water bodies, including big lakes, ponds and storage tank, have been destroyed in Chennai city alone and the current number stands at around 27. It added that the city has only 855 km of storm drains against 2,847 km of urban roads.

Similarly, the 400-kilometer long Buckingham Canal, built by the British for navigation, is another example of waterways-turned-drains. Experts says a failure to de-silt it and the lack of a plan for collecting rainwater is another reason for the floods, adding that it is high time to revive those drain-spots.

The forgotten fact is whenever there is heavy rain or a cyclone, it is the natural lakes and inter-linked drainage systems that help replenish groundwater, hold back some water and release the excess water into the ocean.

Over the past 30 years, nature has given enough warnings. It is high time for the state administration to wake up and learn some lessons from neighbouring countries like Singapore on water management.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

The flood waters in the Pambaleru stream caused severe damage to the National Highway 16 (old NH 5) between Chennai and Nellore leaving a cut of over 20 metres and bringing to a halt the mainstream traffic on both sides even as the authorities diverted vehicles via alternative roads on Tuesday.

As expected, the streams and rivulets like the Swarnamukhi, Kalangi, Kaivalya and Pambaleru were in spate with the flood levels increasing considerably overnight under the impact of heavy rains especially in Venkatagiri, Balayapalli, Guduru, Sullurupeta, Tada and nearby areas.

With no respite in flood level, the authorities chose to wait till the levels recede to carryout repair works on the damage to the NH 16 near Manubolu. The flood waters were so intense that the railings, divider and the side walls were washed away into the fields. The nearby farm fields turned into huge ponds filled with rainwater.

The officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the district administration were taken aback at the sudden turn of situation with the deep cut taking place on the NH 16 for the first time in the last five years.

District Collector M. Janaki, who visited the breach on the NH, said that the breach repair works would be taken up by Wednesday morning when the flood level was expected to ease. “The highway would be reopened for traffic by day after tomorrow. In the meantime, traffic diversions between Chennai and Vijayawada are enforced via Ongole and Kadapa,” she said.

The Chengalamma Temple at Sullurupeta witnessed floodwaters entering the sanctum sanctorum with the trust board initiating efforts for emptying the waters from the premises. The nearby Kalangi rivulet has been increasingly in spate in the past one week following heavy inflows in catchment areas.

A bus, car and autorickshaw were struck in flood waters in the Pambaleru stream near Chaitanya arts college in Gudur area. Timely help from the local public and the police helped in rescuing 40 passengers from the bus. The rescuers used ropes to reach for the stranded passengers.

The stranded bus was coming from Tirupati to head for Guntur and it was coming in a diverted route on account of the heavy rains.

Seeing the intensity of the rains, the Government has delegated two senior IAS officers – Ravi Chandra and A. Giridhar – to look after the rescue and rehabilitation efforts in the affected areas in Nayudupeta and Gudur respectively. They are expected to reach the spot by Tuesday night.

Very heavy rains were reported in interior areas in southwestern parts of Nellore District.

The tamarind tree here that offered sanctuary and saved more than 150 lives during the Musi floods of 1908, would be protected and the past glory of its immediate environs at Afzal Park would be revived, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) Commissioner Somesh Kumar said here on Sunday.

At a meeting organised under the same saviour tree by Centre for Deccan Studies (CDS) and Forum For Better Hyderabad (FBH) to pay homage to the 1908 Musi flood victims, Mr. Somesh Kumar said experts would be roped to restore and maintain the historic tree. The availability of money was not an issue for the civic body, he said.

Responding to pleas to save the Musi, Mr. Somesh Kumar said the task involved departments such as revenue, water board, irrigation and also active involvement on part of the local populace.

“Transforming Musi into a live river and restoring its old glory is a herculean task. However, it can be done and I am hopeful we will do it,” he said.

Towards protecting the city’s heritage, the GHMC has been actively pursuing various works, including the Charminar Pedestrianisation Project and restoration works at the Quli Qutub Shahi Tombs, he said, adding that incentives for protection of heritage structures were also under consideration and orders could be expected soon.

“At least five to six monuments of Hyderabad should be on the UNESCO list but there are none. We need commitment to preserve heritage and maintain them,” the GHMC Commissioner added.

CDS secretary Sajjad Shahid recounted the accounts of havoc caused by the 1908 floods and said the ravaging Musi swept through colonies, destroyed properties and affected thousands of people.

“Hyderabad showed remarkable resilience and rebuilt,” he said, adding that more than 100 years later, the city was still facing similar problems. Mr. Shahid said the tamarind tree needed to be recognised, protected and respected.

FBH president M. Vedakumar called for steps to address issues related to dumping of pollutants and garbage and encroachments to save the Musi.

At least 24 engineering college students from Hyderabad were feared washed away in river Beas in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh late on Sunday evening.

The students were reportedly washed away by the flash floods that occurred in the river after water was released from the upstream Larji Hydro electric project. The engineering students who had entered the river bank on the Mandi-Manali highway were apparently taking photographs at Thalot.

The sudden surge of water swept away at least 18 boys and 6 girls of VNR Institute of Engineering and Technology catching them completely unaware. The college is located in Bachupally on the outskirts of Hyderabad.

There were 61 tourists, including 48 students of the engineering college, who were travelling to the hill station of Manali. Out of 24 missing students, 6 were girls, police said.

The local administration said the gates at Pandoh dam in Mandi, about 15 kms downstream, have been shut to fish out the bodies. The vehicular traffic on the busy Mandi-Manali highway has also been closed to conduct the rescue operations.

The students were on an industrial tour and left Hyderabad on June 3. One of the students, Pratyusha who saved herself said that they were on their way to Kullu from Shimla and they were taking pictures on the river bed. Some students went a bit deep into the waters and they couldn’t rush back as the gushing waters swept them away.

“The project officials had sounded an alert but we did not hear it,” she said sobbing uncontrollably seeking the help of the media to bring them back. “There has been no assistance so far from the HP authorities except for the police grilling us about the number of students,” she lamented.

Andhra Pradesh Resident Commissioner Shashank Goel said that information given by the Mandi Deputy Commissioner Dwesh Kumar said: “The Deputy Commissioner has not confirmed any casualties.”

Himachal Pradesh officials said that the students who were feared washed away could surface in Pandoh dam, which is 15 kms downstream of the site of the tragedy. “Himachal Pradesh officials have requisitioned the services of divers and rafts to take up relief and rescue operations,” Mr. Goel said adding that a two-member team of AP Bhavan – P.Ravin Shankar (Assistant Commissioner) and M. V. S. Rama Rao (Protocol Officer) are leaving by the first flight to Kullu, which has an airport.

Five bodies of students were found in Himachal Pradesh's Mandi district while the fate of 19 others is still not known, an official said.

The CM discussed the ongoing rescue operation with Chief Secretary P. Mitra and Director General of Police Sanjay Kumar, a government spokesperson told IANS.

He said the chief minister ordered the suspension of erring resident engineer of the 126 MW Larji hydropower project being run by the state electricity board and registration of a case of negligence.

More than 60 students and faculty members from V.N.R. Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology were on an excursion to the picturesque tourist resort of Manali. Some of them were getting themselves photographed on the banks of the river in Thalaut area near the Hanogi Mata temple when they were washed away as the flow in the river suddenly increased, Deputy Commissioner Devesh Kumar told IANS.The water level suddenly increased due to release of water in the river without warning from a nearby hydropower project.



""The water was released by the Larji power project dam,"" AFP quoted senior state official Rakesh Kanwar.

Angry locals and tourists blocked the main highway near the river in protest over the incident, saying authorities had failed to issue a warning about the release of water from the dam, according to local media.

Raman Teja, (student, Hyderabad VNR Vigyan Jyoti College), said that the team of students (65 in total) had come to the state for an industrial visit. He said that when they waded into the river bed to click pictures there was less water there but after about 10 minutes a local man shouted to them that the flood gates were open.

He said that there he tried to get his friends out of the water but the water rose quickly. He also said that there were no search and rescue party for three hours and that the police did not respond properly.



The toll in Sunday's accident has risen to five, Additional Deputy Commissioner Pankaj Rai told IANS over phone Monday.Rai said one of the bodies was recovered from Pandoh dam, whose floodgates were closed after the accident. The dam is some 15 km downstream from the accident spot.

The accident spot is located some 200 km from state capital Shimla and on the border of Kullu and Mandi districts. The river was suddenly in spate after the release of water from a nearby hydropower project, authorities said.

A rescue operation was carried out but no body has yet been fished out. The incident occurred around 7 p.m.

Additional District Magistrate Pankaj Rai said the rescue operation was stopped due to darkness.""The chances of survival are bleak as the current in the river is very strong. The rescue operation will begin early (Monday) morning,"" he added.

Expressing her grave concern over the shocking incident ,Union HRD Minister Smriti Irani today assured the state of all possible assistance from the Centre.

Irani assured the state Education Ministry, held by Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh,""of all assistance and support required from the Centre"", a statement released by the HRD ministry said.

She also spoke to the faculty of the engineering college in Hyderabad who was accompanying the traveling student group.The principal of the college was also assured of all cooperation to tackle the tragedy.

Home Minister Rajnath Singh also expressed his shock over the incident.

I am deeply pained over the tragic incident of engineering students getting drowned in a flash flood in Himachal Pradesh. — Rajnath Singh (@BJPRajnathSingh) June 8, 2014

I have instructed the authorities to despatch a rescue team for immediate action and save precious lives trapped in the floods. — Rajnath Singh (@BJPRajnathSingh) June 8, 2014

A team of the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), headed by Commandant Jaideep Singh, is likely to reach the spot by noon, official sources said.

The NDRF team comprises 72 people were dispatched from Delhi. Official sources said the divers from the Bhakra Beas Management Board have been summoned for the search operation.

Himachal Pradesh and other Himalayan states including neighbouring Uttarakhand are home to a string of hydroelectric projects as India rushes to expand power generation to meet rising demand.

Governments are attempting to harness the power of rivers despite the risk of environmental damage to diversify away from costly and polluting coal and gas plants to meet the country's electricity shortage.

A government report in April concluded that hydropower projects in northern India were partly to blame for devastating floods last year that killed thousands.

Rescuers on Tuesday made little headway in tracing 19 students of a Hyderabad-based engineering college and a tour guide who were washed away due to sudden discharge of water from the reservoir of Larji Hydropower Project.

Bodies of five students including three girls and a boy were recovered on Monday by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams.

A team comprising 84 NDRF men and 10 divers carried out a search operation in turbulent Beas River from the accident spot Thalaut and Pandoh Dam, Jaideep Singh, Commanding Officer, NDRF said.

A dozen boats, local divers and rafters also assisted the NDRF teams in the rescue operations.

The volume of water in Pandoh Dam was very high but the flood gates cannot be opened as there is a threat of the bodies being washed away, officials said.

Devesh Kumar, District Magistrate, Mandi said, “A system of protocol is already available to the dam authorities but I am sure that some deficiencies must be there… I would say that adequate number of signboards are a necessity on the stretches” where the accident took place.

Telangana Home Minister Nayani Narasimha Reddy said the families feel that the search should be carried out “deep”.

“Families argue that the search should be carried out deep. Collector and the administration people say it is not easy to carry deep search,” Reddy said.

“Dam water was released without caution or siren. Children got into the river when the water was less. The water increased suddenly and washed them away,” he said.

About 60 students and faculty members of the V.N.R. Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology in Hyderabad were on an excursion to Manali and 25 persons were washed away in flash floods following sudden release of water from reservoir of Larji hydropower project near Thalot on Sunday evening.

Himachal government has announced an immediate relief of Rs 1.50 lakh to the next of kin of the engineering college students washed away.

“We have announced a compensation of Rs 1.50 lakh to next of kin of each victim and also made arrangement for sending the bodies of the victims and also provide all possible help to the affected families”, Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh told reporters.

The Chief Minister said that an inquiry by Divisional Commissioner, Mandi has already been ordered into the accident and all vulnerable points along river banks where power projects have constructed dams would be “fenced”. Sign boards with warning signals would also be displayed at these places.

The alarm systems would be made more effective and the people would be informed about the alarms so that they take necessary precautions and avoid taking risk, he added.

All the survivors and five bodies recovered by rescue teams were flown to Hyderabad by an Air India flight last night while families of some missing students who had flown to Kullu with Union Civil Aviation Minister Pusapati Ashok Gajapathi Raju have stayed back and are hoping for recovery of more bodies.

One of the most lasting legacies of the Deccan has been the water management policy formulated by the Kakatiya dynasty, which relied mainly on small tanks for its irrigation and drinking water requirements. There was a time when the Telangana countryside boasted of thousands of tanks which ensured a perennial supply of water for settlements across the region.The Qutub Shahi rulers continued the practice by adding numerous tanks of their own, especially in the areas abutting the citadel at Golconda. A majority of those tanks continued to serve the population till post-reorganisation exploitation of the region’s resources led to their being either rendered dry or unusable due to pollution.Following the great floods of 1908, Mahboob Ali Khan, the then Nizam of Hyderabad, sought long-term and effective solutions to the perennial inundation brought on by a recalcitrant Musi. Initiating the process of ‘improvement’ with a search for the right person to handle the future planning of Hyderabad, the Nizam refused the recommendations of Lord Curzon in offering the services of Sir Michel Esthesol, director general of irrigation, Government of India. Ignoring the availability of T D Mackenzie, chief engineer of the Nizam’s Dominions, he chose the native expert Sir M Visvesvarayya for the job. This was not just a pointed snub at the British, who had already antagonized the Nizam with their unreasonable attitude in dealing with the state, but an informed decision if one takes into account the renowned engineer’s role in influencing policy at the irrigation commission. Visvesvarayya’s ingenious flood control proposal for Hyderabad led to the creation of Osman Sagar and Himayat Sagar, the two ‘balancing tanks’ located upstream of the city. The twin reservoirs, based on the Kakatiya model, served the dual purpose of taming the Musi and at the same time providing an assured water supply to the city.It is said that 16 villages were submerged to create this sprawling lake, which once spread over 45 square kilometres. The painful displacement of ancient settlements was, however, amply justified by the immediately-apparent benefits of the scheme. Foremost among these was the delivery of safe potable drinking water directly to homes.Popularly known as Gandipet, Osman Sagar has found a unique place in the hearts of a grateful public, who swear by the curative properties of its waters. It is claimed that the Gandipet waters provide a panacea for almost all known ailments. No wonder then that Gandipet ka Pani, along with the equally notorious Hyderabadi Biryani, has been traditionally blamed for luring visitors into settling down in the city once they acquire a taste for these two cherished commodities.Understandably, the Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan remained ever suspicious of Gandipet water, refusing to drink even a single drop from the reservoir named after him! This abhorrence is generally believed to have stemmed from an ingrained preference for the waters of Bam Rukn-ud Dowla, the traditional source of drinking water for Hyderabadi Royalty. The fact that the Nizam never let his personal preferences stand in the way of progress is abundantly manifest in the fact that King Kothi remained unconnected to the state-of-the-art water supply and sewerage network that was commissioned for the city. There is a popular belief that this resolute stand against modernisation arose due to an assurance given by the Nizam to his palace staff that change would not deprive them of their jobs.Hyderabad was once famous for its gardens and the suburbs of the city were referred to as the ‘Baghaat’ or Garden district. However, by the time of the 1908 floods, most of the historic water bodies in the city and its periphery had been commandeered to cater to the drinking water requirements and minor cultivation needs. The lush gardens of Hyderabad were but a distant memory. With the two major reservoirs providing for the water needs of the city, older water bodies were free to cater to parks and gardens proposed under the city improvement scheme. In certain areas, lakebeds were to be drained and reused as open spaces and parks. Though the implementation of CIB proposals was abandoned post re-organisation, the Hussainsagar continued to irrigate the gardens of Osmania University and downstream localities till industrial effluents rendered it into a cesspool.The proposal of the Telangana government in favour of protecting lakes is a welcome move and signals a return to the maliciously abandoned schemes of the CIB. Emulating the Kakatiyan legacy bore fruit during the Asaf Jahi period, especially during the reigns of the last two Nizams. Revisiting Visvesvarayya’s proposals and reverting to traditional water management systems will undoubtedly prove to be immensely beneficial for Telangana.",,1908 Hyderabad floods,"Hyderabad, India",1908-09-07,1908-09-10,Hyderabad,100 mm,100 crores,1000,severe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Kavitha Iyer,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Hyderabad_floods_1908.jpg/220px-Hyderabad_floods_1908.jpg,,,,,Severe

The worst floods in Jammu and Kashmir in the past 60 years and the subsequent devastation are due to a combination of unprecedented and intense rain, mismanagement, unplanned urbanisation and a lack of preparedness, Sunita Narain, director-general, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said on Wednesday.

A CSE analysis showed the floods were a manifestation of an extreme weather event linked to climate change. Ms. Narain said the changing rainfall pattern in India was part of extreme events which followed a trend. She called for a national action plan to forecast floods.

In an analysis of extreme events in India from 2005 to 2013, Chandra Bhushan, CSE deputy director-general, said the four events he studied — from the Mumbai floods in 2005 to the recent floods in Jammu and Kashmir — were either attributed to interaction between western disturbances and the monsoon system, excessive rain or freak unusual events; there was no mention of climate change.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests had expressed no opinion on the frequency of these extreme events, and there was complete silence on their link to climate change, Mr. Bhushan pointed out.

Extreme events In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its fourth assessment report, said extreme rainfall events were set to increase over the Indian subcontinent. In its fifth assessment report, the IPCC said the intensity of rainfall in India would increase. A study by B.N. Goswami of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in 2006 had predicted changes in rainfall across India and especially over the Himalayan range, which would have a high impact in the region, apart from the west coast and central India.

The study of data between 1950 and 2000 showed that the incidence of heavy and very heavy rainfall (more than 100 mm and 150 mm/ a day) had increased and moderate rainfall decreased.

Jammu and Kashmir does not have a flood forecasting system, not even a separate disaster management plan, said Ms Narain. In 2004, a remote sensing data-based study of Jammu and Kashmir had shown that 55 per cent of wetlands, drainage channels and water bodies had been encroached upon. Ms Narain said Jammu and Kashmir had an intricate system of water management. The lake areas had diminished, the holding capacity of many water bodies had gone down, and houses were built in places they should never have been, she pointed out.

Devastating floods in Jammu and Kashmir have caused an immediate loss of Rs. 5,400-5,700 crore to the state’s economy, with heavy damages to trade, hotels, restaurants, horticulture and handicraft, according to initial estimates of industry body Assocham.

Jammu & Kashmir has been hit by the worst floods in over a century, throwing basic infrastructure like power, railways and communication in the state completely out of gear.

The initial estimated loss to hotels, trade, agriculture — horticulture, roads and bridges in the Jammu and Kashmir regions itself is Rs. 2,630 crore. Besides, high-cost infrastructure like Railways, power and communication in the hilly terrains would have suffered a loss of about Rs. 2,700-3,000 crore, the industry body said.

“These are only initial estimates of the loss. The real loss to the Jammu and Kashmir economy will be much higher since the impact of such calamities is long-drawn and it takes long time before the physical infrastructure is restored. The biggest worry is the shattering of confidence among the tourists and it will take long time and effort to win back the tourists to the state,” said Assocham Secretary General D.S. Rawat.

Mr. Rawat cited the example of Uttarakhand which also witnessed unprecedented floods last year, saying it was yet to recover from the shocks.

“J&K’s economy stood at Rs. 45,399 crore in 2013-14. The sectoral composition of state GDP indicates that agri & allied activities account for 20 per cent in the state GDP, industry and mining contribute to about 23.5 per cent and the services sector made up the remaining 56.5 per cent. Trade, hotels and restaurant services registered a turnover of close to Rs. 3,800 crore during 2013-2014. The tourism industry sources of J&K state roughly distribute the tourists among Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh region in the ratio of 40:40:20,” according to Assocham.

“The September-November season tourist inflow both from India and abroad is severely affected as is being witnessed by large scale cancellations. While cancellations for airlines, hotels are 100 per cent upto October 15, those who had booked for winters are watching the situation,” feedback from the industry chamber’s travel constituents indicated.",flood,2014 Jammu and Kashmir floods,"Jammu and Kashmir, India","September 6, 2014","September 15, 2014","Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh",1000 mm,"Rs. 5,400-5,700 crore",200+,"Shattered confidence among tourists, loss of tourism revenue, damage to infrastructure",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Four generations of Mattoos had lived in our family home, in one of the most pleasant neighbourhoods of Srinagar: Gogji Bagh. My grandfather liked to tell his grandchildren that they should ensure that their spine was as strong as the foundations of our house! It had survived every vicissitude in the ups and downs of the Mattoo family and Kashmir: earthquakes, militancy (a bullet in my great grandfather’s portrait is a reminder of the violent 1990s), deaths and personal grief.

On Saturday evening, there was the first ominous sign: there was a power outage. We slept, however, comforted by the prediction of the local meteorology chief, Sonam Lotus, who has become a popular icon for the accuracy of his forecasts, that Sunday would be sunny. And indeed I woke to a radiant blue sky with not a cloud in sight. But the power outage had continued through the night, and I got a frightened phone call from a neighbour at about 9.30 a.m. that the bund on the bank of the Jhelum (near Lal Ded hospital, about a kilometre from our house) had been breached!

Within minutes the water was streaming ferociously into our garden. I calculated we had about an hour before our ground floor was submerged; actually we had just about 30 minutes.

In that frenzy, we could only really clear the kitchen: food and water to feed a staff of 12 — and moved to the upper storeys. The water had risen one- and-a-half storeys by the afternoon and we stayed up that night maintaining a vigil, not entirely sure what we would do if the water rose to the upper floors: we had no power, no phones (mobile or landline), no contact with anyone, and just a couple of messages that we were not sure had been delivered. The night echoed with cries of ‘bachao bachao’ from the nearby Gujjar and Bakerwal hostel in Amar Singh college and other places!

On Monday morning, we were finally rescued by the brave jawans of the Indian Army in a paddle boat and taken to a safer point at the bund – with just one small bag each.

There was no sign of relief or help.

The only option was to rush to the airport. We did so with the kindness of good Samaritans, and after walking kilometres in waist-deep water. Many who helped had never met us, some were friends from Facebook, including Ashraf Bhat – a distinguished lawyer, who walked with us and dropped us near the airport, young Suhail who helped us find a short cut and helped my parents traverse the wall that led us to a dryer route. And Dr. Khan and Sherwani Sahib for finally dropping us to the airport!

We are back in Delhi’s safety, but deeply concerned about those in the valley who are still marooned. Today, Prime Minister, rescue Kashmir, and Kashmiris will respect you forever!

Even as monsoon rains continued to lash the southern districts, the IAF and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) responded with lightning speed to an SOS from Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam to rescue 10 persons caught in floods in Dindigul district on Tuesday.

The 10 persons, including Varshini (14 years) and Surya (16), who were trapped at Kallipatti village of Oddanchatram taluk, were bailed out to safety by the contingents with assistance from the district administration.

The flood was caused by a heavy rainfall of 20.2 cm in Palani and Kodaikanal on Monday and the consequent breach of Nallathangal Odai and another stream.

A helicopter from Sulur IAF base reached the spot at 2.20 p.m. and 40 members of the NDRF left Arakkonam and reached Dindigul by road. The IAF had a 10-member contingent. By 3.45 p.m., all the affected persons were rescued. Dindigul Collector N. Venkatachalam said the condition of rescued persons was stable.

Palani-Dindigul, Palani-Kodaikanal and Bodi-Munnar highways were closed for traffic due to heavy flow of rainwater or landslip.

Vehicles bound for Dindigul, Tiruchi and Madurai from Palani and Udumalpet were diverted through Thoppampatti to reach Oddanchatram as Palani-Dindigul highway was closed.

Malti and Bhagwati Devi are just two of the thousands of people who have had to abandon their homes to take shelter on an embankment in flood-affected Bihar’s Supaul district. Their main worry, however, is not hunger but the difficulties they face in going through their ablutions unlike men. “Poor women like us face more problems to relieve ourselves when floods force us to flee our villages. It is our fate. No one can imagine this except those like us,” said Bhagwati, in her late 30s, who along with her family have taken shelter on the eastern Kosi embankment.

Malti, in her early 50s and the mother of three young daughters, spoke of her ignominy. “We have no option but to relieve ourselves in the open by closing our eyes and minds to the hell-like situation,” she said.

With major rivers including the Kosi, Gandak, Bagmati and Ganga rising and posing a serious threat, Malti and Bhagwati are two of thousands of women in flood—affected districts in the state living with shame and fighting to relieve themselves. “Flood-hit poor women face more problems than men as more than for food, they have to fight shame and shock to relieve themselves either on the crowded embankment or nearby. There is no other place as there is life—threatening water all around,” said Ranjeev, a flood expert who works in the Kosi region.

Mahender Yadav, an activist working in the same regiion, told IANS: “It is beyond imagination how women trapped by the rising rivers go through their ablutions.”

A much sought—after item by these women is polythene sheets or bags with which they can wrap around themselves and stand in the water to relieve themselves. “Even polythene sheets are in short supply as the authorities have failed to provide them,” Mr. Yadav said.

Ranjeev said neither the men of their families nor the government pay proper attention to this big problem of women in the flood—hit district.

He said that there is no plan to erect makeshift toilets on the embankments for women. “A few years ago, a British woman researcher was with me on a visit to an embankment during floods. She was stunned to know that women have been forced to relieve themselves in the open as there was no arrangement made for them,” Ranjeev recalled.

It is over 10 days that rivers continued to flow above the danger mark in Saharsa, Supaul, Madhepura, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Khagaria, Sitamarhi, Nalanda and other districts, affecting 1.6 million people in more than 850 villages.

Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, after an aerial survey of the flood—affected 15 districts last week said the situation is grim but under control. He ordered the district officials to provide relief and rescue on a priority basis to people living in inundated areas.

The floods have so far claimed 17 lives in the state.

The state government has evacuated 116,000 people till date from flooded areas and around 50,000 people have taken shelter in 133 relief camps set up by the government at different places. The government had earlier sounded a high alert as the water level of major rivers in north Bihar rose following heavy rain in their catchment areas in Nepal.

458,2607,hyderabad,2014,https://www.financialexpress.com/archive/a-pearl-losing-its-shine/1252239/,19 May 2014,A pearl losing its shine,"A small pearl shop-owner at the magnificent Charminar, a landmark monument of the old city of Hyderabad, has been selling pearls for the last 40 years. Khan sahib, a pan-chewing, typical Hyderabadi of around 60 years of age, says he has been selling different kinds of pearls of various shapes and sizes. There were days, two decades ago, when he used to get a profit of R50 a month, which gradually increased to R150 per month. However, after 1990s, his business started going downstream. He realised that the City of Pearls, Hyderabad, had started losing its sheen and market momentum, thanks to the advent of Chinese pearls, which could either be cultured or fake.

Hyderabad pearls have had a very long history with the erstwhile Nizams of Hyderabad patronising pearl trade. Once upon a time, Chandanpet, just outside Hyderabad, was popularly known for its expertise in the delicate art of pearl drilling. Around 200 years ago, the trade flourished in the city. Dealers from Persia used to come here to trade and made good money. The city got its name from this trade as the volume of business was huge. Later, the market started to concentrate at other places across the country.

?The once famous Hyderabad pearls, patronised by the Nizams for over 200 years, are losing lustre and sheen. It is very expensive to procure natural pearls. So there is a shift for cheaper ones due to affordability,? says a leading jeweller from the city. Pearls from Japan, Australia, Indonesia, Burma, Venezuela and Tahiti are also coming to the market. Incidentally, pearls from Basra (Iraq) were in huge demand and the city was once a leading producer of natural pearls. But, after the war, production stopped, as most of the oysters died due to excess oil exploration.

Another interesting reason seems to be about the ongoing shift in the customers? preference and the evolving fashion trends which has seen many traders and jewellers change the preferences to precious stones instead of pearls. Says Satish Agarwal, MD, Kundan Jewellers and Exporters, ?There is a change in the fashion, and trends have shrunk the market both in terms of quantity and value over the years. In the last 10 years, sales have decreased by 5%. In fact, it is a gradual falling decade of pearls,? he says with regret.

?Over the last 5 to 10 years, prices of pearls have seen a downfall by 10-20% even while the demand has also fallen by 5%,? Agarwal says. The reason is obvious that the availability of pearls is not at all restricted to Hyderabad. ?Though Hyderabad never produced pearls, the trade was well patronised. However, pearls are now available pan-India,? he says. Thanks to imports from China, which seem to have flooded every jewellery shop.

There is no resale value for pearls, and it is also a one-time buy for a pearl strand, unlike gold or silver jewellery. And this comes at a price. For instance, a strand of South Sea pearls costs between R30,000 and R3 lakh. So this is more or less a one-time buy, rather than a gold jewellery which can be exchanged too. Good quality Tahiti black pearls are available for R50,000 to R1 lakh per strand. This used to be three times more five years ago, jewellers say. ?Diminishing demand for pearls has forced many jewellers to change their loyalty to other precious stones or platinum jewellery,? says another city-based jeweller.

China has been the world?s biggest pearl producer for two decades, flooding the world market with small and cheap pearls. While lot of imports are happening for cultured pearls from Australia, Japan, Indonesia, Tahiti, Venezuela, the demand for South Sea pearls has improved. As Agarwal points out, freshwater pearl farms in east-central China are reported to be producing white pearls that cost a fraction of the saltwater variety. South Sea pearls, which are sourced from the South China Sea, are also readily available and fall in the expensive range because of their large size and sheen. Tahitian pearls cost more than others.

With poor demand and supply of pearls, Hyderabad is no longer called the City of Pearls, with the volumes having shrunk to just a few tonnes. The Hyderabad market has bid adieu to those truly black pearls which were the most beautiful pearls in the world and Hyderabad is a poorer city today for it.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Hyderabad fort, Sind, 1844.

""The Fort formed at once the place of defence, the treasury, and the residence of the native rulers.""

— Richard F. Burton in *Sindh revisited*

Located right in the centre of Hyderabad, Sindh, are the remains of a fort. Only a part of the ruined majesty remains now; the grandeur of the past long gone.

The story of the Pakka Fort is a fascinating tale, one documenting the rise and fall of different rulers.

Eastern ramparts.

The main entrance.

It is said that the constant floods in Khudabad frustrated Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhora, the ruler of Sindh. He decided to abandon Khudabad and shift his capital to a new place in the late 1760s.

Kalhora decided to build a new capital on the ruins of an ancient fishing village on a hillock known locally as Ganji ('bald' or 'barren'). The ancient village, once known as Neroon or Neroonkot, is traced back to the Mauryan era (322-185 BCE).

The hillock fort’s construction is said to have been headed by Diwan Gidumal, an intelligent courtier, who was given ‘two boats full of money’ by Ghulam Shah. He stayed close to the location during the construction, which finished in 1768. It is the use of pakki or burnt bricks which gave the mighty fort its name: Pakko Qilo in Sindhi and Pakka Qila in Urdu.

The main gate.

The view from down below.

The fort served as the seat for Ghulam Shah, from where he could see his new capital ‘Hyderabad’ shaping up. His sudden death after just a few years (around 1771-72) was the beginning of the fall of Kalhora rule.

The assassinations of Baloch chiefs and an air of distrust in the region led to the Battle of Halani, fought between Kalhoras and Talpurs (a Baloch tribe), in 1782. The Talpurs, led by Mir Fateh Ali Khan Talpur, brought an end to the Kalhora rule in Sindh.

Fateh Ali kept ruling from Khudabad until it was inundated by River Indus which was changing its course, after which Hyderabad was made capital again. It was during Fateh Ali's rule that the Pakka Fort reached the peak of its glory days. New buildings were added and old ones repaired.

The Mir Haram, which still stands, was built during Fateh Ali’s rule. The succeeding Talpur rulers also added various buildings and structures to the fort.

In his book Scenes in a Soldier’s Life, published in 1848, J.H.W. Hall describes the fort as follows:

""The walls of the fortress are built of brick and stone, and are of immense thickness; it is about half a mile square and contains nearly 1800 dwelling houses; some of them are the palaces of the Ameers of Scinde; in its interior there is also a very lofty tower mounted by seventy-six steps to the top, in which are placed four large pieces of ordnance, 84-pounders, of Persian manufacture.""

Edward Archer Langley, of Madras Cavalry, describes the location of the fort in his book as:

""The fort and citadel, which last is of great height, tower above the city and have a picturesque appearance from the river.""

The river that Mr Langley refers to is River Indus, which used to flow through the city once.

The 33-acre establishment was nothing short of a marvel once. It is written that the fort was once filled with gardens, large palaces and halls and other beautiful structures. But in 1843, the downfall began.

British forces led by Charles Napier fought against the Talpurs. The British won the battle, and Sindh finally belonged to them.

The fort was damaged heavily in the process. The British were ruthless, and made sure that most of the buildings were razed to the ground. Whatever buildings were spared became offices for British authorities. The part nearest to the gate was converted into a museum later on. The huge towers that stood in the fort were demolished as well, to prevent its use in any future uprisings.

British Raj buildings within the fort.

The ruined tower.

Following Partition in 1947 and the large influx of migrants from India, authorities used the fort as a temporary settlement. But with time, the temporary settlement slowly transformed into its modern-day form: a shanty-town.

Illegal occupation was another major issue. Despite some efforts from the government around early '90s, people have been reluctant to move to other areas despite the looming safety issues. The lack of any proper water drainage system has also been responsible for the fort’s current state.

The fort’s original shape was somewhat oval, and only some of its ramparts have survived. The dilapidated gate of the fort towards the west, which faces the entrance of the Shahi Bazar is also there. A short walk, and a left turn, and later a few steps and a narrow passageway leads to the Mir Haram, which I mentioned earlier.

There is a large building which was once used by Talpurs, and later converted to a museum. On the top of the wall are faded murals.

It is said that artefacts from the museum were stolen over the course of time, along with cash from the archaeology department treasury. A building right opposite to the Mir Haram is an office building, which is still being used by government authorities. Right next to the Mir Haram, on the left, is a large wooden gate. It has metallic spike-shaped structures all over its surface.

Wooden gate.

Another little known surviving structure lies towards the east of the fort premises, known among the locals of the area as Qilay Ki Surang (the fort’s tunnel). Passing through some narrow lanes, one comes across a gate, leading to a series of steps, which take you to a prominent grave and some so-called tunnels.

Path leading to the the 'Qilay Ki Surang'.

The local I met with told me that the way to the tunnels was sealed by people, partly due to abuse by drug addicts. Where the tunnels once led is anybody’s guess.

Sealed tunnels.

On the left is a large tent-shaped structure, which I was told is where the kings kept their horse — a royal stable. I couldn’t find references to the structure anywhere, but it was an interesting sight, albeit in a terrible condition with heaps of garbage making more than clear its modern use: a large dumpster.

A tent-shaped structure little is known about.

It is a tragedy that Pakka Fort is suffering from this fate. Its walls have been falling down for a long time, while people continue to live there.

I wish I could be more hopeful about the fort’s future. I hope the authorities protect whatever is left of the fort. Otherwise, another important heritage monument will cease to exist.

The south-west monsoon for the year 2014 officially ended on September 30. Overall the monsoon has been a mixed bag with many areas of India having a deficit but some areas having a surplus. In the city of Bangalore we were confronted with heavy rains in September; on one particular day it rained more than 120 mm in a short span of a few hours, causing flooding. This will be the pattern in cities, floods at certain times and shortage of piped water at the same time.

As cities get paved, creating hard impenetrable surfaces, the ability of rainwater to percolate into the soil and thence to the aquifer reduces to almost zero. Surface run-off increases dramatically and can go up by a factor of 9. The garbage-choked drains have to cope with a high intensity of rainfall and substantially increased run-off, not to mention buildings in valleys and low lying areas, causing urban floods. At the root of this phenomenon is lack of planning, and building in the wrong places. Not respecting drainage lines and flood plains exacerbates the situation. What can be done about it?

One remedy is to design and plan for every urban micro-watershed by reducing run-off and increasing infiltration into the soil and aquifers. A recharge well is a good way of doing this.

What is a recharge well? Usually a precast concrete ring lined structure, typically a metre or 1.5 metres in diameter and going to a depth of 3 to 8 metres, a recharge well takes water run-off from rooftops, paved areas and roads, filters it and sends it underground to increase the water table. Unlike a conventional well which taps into the aquifer, the recharge well sends water into the aquifer. By changing the flow of rainwater into the ground it is possible to mitigate the impact of floods.

A well-designed recharge well, depending on the soil profile of a place, can send a million litres of water annually into the ground. By coordinating a given catchment area, the coefficient of runoff and the infiltration rate at a place, appropriate recharge wells can be made and the numbers required can be arrived at. They can be linked to the stormwater drains present and placed within the drains itself.

Layouts, apartments and institutions have found that they become zero storm-water discharge zones and have had the added benefit of increased water availability in their borewells and open wells.

It is time that we use the recharge well as an important tool in the sustainable management of water in our cities and in preventing or mitigating floods.

The army doctors without caring about their own houses and families affected by the floods have been working day and night at the 600-bed facility, the biggest army hospital in the entire Kashmir Valley.

The family of Riyaz Ahmed, whose three-month-old daughter was suffering from encephalitis, was preparing to face the worst as the doctors at the district hospital in Anantnag gave up hope of saving the infant.

""Doctors in Anantnag told us that they won't be able to save our daughter and that we should take her home and be prepared for the worst,” Riyaz who is a driver by profession told PTI.

However, after flood waters entered his village, an army helicopter rescued the family. ""They brought us at the army hospital here and since then the treatment of my daughter is on,"" Riyaz said.

The doctors treating the infant say that she has fully recovered and was now out of danger.

Riyaz said that the army doctors have performed a miracle by saving the life of his daughter. ""Even if I have to give my life for them a thousand times, I will happily do that.

""These men here have given a new lease of life to my entire family,"" Riyaz said.

Brigadier Lamba said that as soon as the water started entering the GB Panth children hospital in the Srinagar city, the army hospital opened its doors for the infants who were undergoing treatment at the hospital and had to be rescued.

""The babies coming to our hospital from the GB Panth hospital were in the age group of one day old to a few months old.

""They were undergoing treatment for various diseases. Some of these babies were brought in critical condition as some were cases of pre-mature deliveries and had to be kept in ICU,"" he said.

Despite the floods, he said, the army doctors have been regularly reporting on duty to save the lives of the patients who were brought to the hospital.

The Tibetan plateau has become the focus of intense meteorological study in a never-before attempt to understand its effect on climate locally as well as globally, notes Nature News.

This development follows close on the heels of the massive floods which hit Kashmir and Pakistan recently.

The $49-million Chinese effort, in which the plateau is being flooded with sensors, is aimed to help predict extreme weather — both in Asia and as far away as North America — and give scientists knowledge on how climate change affects these events.

Having a high altitude, the plateau receives more sunlight, gets hotter than land at sea level. Acting like a giant heating plate it pumps air upwards which disperses in the upper troposphere, influencing atmospheric circulation and thereby, climate.

The heat also intensifies monsoons, which are caused by land-ocean temperature differences which in turn cause pressure gradients.

Being the biggest and highest plateau in the world, it disturbs the troposphere unlike any other structure on earth. However, there are little data on the impact on climate.

The plateau’s remoteness, altitude and harsh conditions — it is often called the third pole because it hosts the world’s third-largest stock of ice — meaning that even basic weather stations are few.

Satellite data are also plagued by large errors owing to lack of calibration from ground observations.

But now, in central and western Tibet, researchers jointly funded by the China Meteorological Administration and the National Natural Science Foundation of China began, in August, to place temperature and moisture detectors in the soil and to erect 32-metre-high towers laden with sensors that measure cloud properties. In recent weeks, the team has begun deploying sensors mounted on weather balloons and unmanned aerial vehicles.

“The data should help determine the extent to which different types of land surface heat up the overlying air, and how this might vary in response to factors such as snow cover and vegetation changes,” Wu Guoxiong, an atmospheric scientist at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Beijing and a principal investigator of the project told Nature News.

“Climate models have the greatest uncertainties in Tibet and the Himalayas, and are especially weak at simulating monsoons,” Xu Xiangde, an atmospheric scientist at the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences in Beijing and investigator on the project said to Nature News .",,Kashmir Floods,"Kashmir, Pakistan",July 2014,August 2014,"Kashmir, Pakistan",100 mm,$10 billion,"1,000+","Destroyed infrastructure, loss of crops, displacement of people",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Labelled as a safe haven for kidnappers and robbers, the suburbs in Hyderabad and Jamshoro districts inhabited by the migrant Sindhi population will come under a joint operation by the Rangers and police within a week, The Express Tribune has learnt.





According to sources in the police department, this was decided in a meeting between the officials of the law enforcement agencies on Wednesday. ‘These areas will be cordoned off while aerial monitoring will also be carried out,” an official told. When contacted, Hyderabad Region DIG Naeem Akram Bharoka confirmed that such an operation has been planned.“We have ample crime records and intelligence reports that these suburbs have become dens of different types of criminals, who take shelter there and after committing crimes escape to their hometown,” said the DIG. He, however, refused to disclose which specific neighbourhoods will be part of the operation. Bharoka also avoided telling the length of the planned operation.A large number of flood and rain affected people from northern Sindh settled in the outskirts of Hyderabad and Jamshoro’s Kotri taluka after the 2010 floods.

As a fortunate survivor of one of India’s deadliest railway disasters, the Ariyalur train accident, it is time to lay my story and the nightmarish ghosts to rest, by putting my experiences down in writing.

It occurred on November 23, 1956, leaving 142 passengers dead and 110 injured. An estimated 200 people were buried in the debris. Many were missing, their bodies never to be recovered.

Torrential rains had swollen the river Maruthaiyar to a level where the waters almost touched the rails on a bridge between the Ariyalur and Kallagam stations, breaking the embankment to a length of nearly 20 feet, causing flash floods.

Off the rails About 2 miles after leaving Ariyalur station and 20 miles away from Trichinopoly (Tiruchirapalli), the train slipped off the rails. Its steam engine and seven timber-built carriages including the parcel van telescoped and fell into the river. The eighth coach derailed and four carriages in the rear remained intact.

Then aged 21, I had boarded the Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) Express at Madras (Chennai) at 9.50 the night before, with my aunt. Like Santa in his gift-filled sleigh, we were laden with our Christmas shopping from Moore Market, an old-fashioned steam engine deputising for the reindeer for our journey to Trichinopoly. We were the only occupants of a bay of the eighth compartment of the 13-coach train, one having been detached at Virudhachalam to go on to Salem separately. After a light meal, we settled down for the night and soon fell into deep sleep.

Our terrifying ordeal began with a tremendous jolt and bang. There was a sizzling hiss of steam and, then, ear-piercing screams. After being left sprawling across the floor of the compartment, my first urge after regaining my composure was to jump out of the train. My aunt grabbed me on time: “Don’t jump! We are on a river,” she screamed. She saved me from a watery grave.

Like a puppet on a string, I ran around the compartment in circles. My watch showed it was 5.30 a.m. Peering out of the window, the first crack of daylight revealed a mighty river that roared eerily as it frothed and rushed furiously, taking everything in its path — trees, train wreckage and bodies of men, women and infants. Perched on a platform on the bridge, the guard yelled, “Get out, your compartment has derailed.” In response, my aunt, in her overpowering voice, shouted: “follow me.” “I can’t,” I cried, clinging to her. Wrenching herself off, she bravely unlatched the door and lowered herself to the step of the compartment precariously. She then clambered along, holding on window to window and heading towards the rear of the train.

In an incredible act of heroism, we were walking back to Ariyalur station to seek help.

Prayer for deliverance Turning my eye heavenward, I prayed for deliverance. Mustering my courage and leaving the precious parcels behind, I followed my aunt in utter terror along with other passengers who had vacated the eighth coach. I remembered the lines from Tennyson’s ‘The Charge of the Light Brigade’: “...into the valley of death rode...”

My heart pounded, my teeth chattered and I trembled with fear and cold as I gripped the window bars of the compartments. Loosening my grip would mean certain death. Using every ounce of my strength and with unswerving determination I struggled to save my life. With bruised palms I swayed across four compartments and eventually reached the last compartment in the reassuring presence of my aunt. She was a heroine.

Frightening hours Being stranded there, waiting to be rescued with floodwaters on either side of the track, were the most frightening hours of my life, observing a scene a human eye could never have seen. It has haunted me all my life. The river bank was bathed in blood with human pulp, headless corpses, severed limbs, torsos and heaps of bodies wrecked of life’s esteem.

After an anxious wait of about four hours, the floodwaters gradually abated. Finally, as the river meekly meandered in its course and corpses bobbed in and out of water, we were rescued. A locomotive arrived to tow us safely back to the Ariyalur station.

There were triumphant screams mingled with sadness for those lost in one of the worst disasters that gripped a nation.

( At the time of the accident, young Joyce Philomena was a clerk at the Golden Rock Railway School in Tiruchi, newly recruited by Southern Railway. Two years later, she was tranferred to the Divisional Railway Superintendent's office in Tiruchi. She married Clarence Vernem, a Guard with Southern Railway, and moved to Madurai where she continued to work for the Railways until opting for voluntary retirement from service in 1982.

The following year, Mr. Vernem passed away. She migrated to Australia in 1996 to join her two children and their families. She now lives in Melbourne (right). Upon being contacted by The Hindu on the phone on March 1 after she sent in her account to Open Page, Ms. Vernem (who provided the details given here of herself) said she remained terrified of trains for years. She later mustered the courage if only to watch passing trains, and would marvel at “how brave the passengers were” !

After suffering nightmares and sleep-walking disorders, she eventually overcame her dread, and often passed Ariyalur by train. A year shy of 80, she still occasionally takes the train in Australia, and lives a “very active life.”

The month of September is not among the favourite times of the year for travellers from Bangalore to Jammu and Kashmir, which is now battered by heavy rainfall and floods. This month falls between the two peak tourist seasons of Kashmir.

According to tourism industry insiders, the peak season for Jammu and Kashmir is between April and July, and October and December. Many visit the State during this off-peak season owing to the bait of low hotel tariffs.

“The number of travellers to Kashmir is low right now. If the flooding had happened in the peak season, the situation would have been far worse for tourists,” said Sanjar Imam, vice-president of the Karnataka Travel Forum.

Besides, those visiting the temple shrine of Vaishno devi, near Jammu, also extended their travel to Srinagar.

Also, with Ladakh region emerging as a favourite destination for adventure-seekers and bikers, many prefer to travel to Srinagar and Jammu region.

The government needs to come to the rescue of those who have been affected by the Bhopal tragedy (“ >Contamination still hounds Bhopal residents ,” Dec.2). A government that worked round-the-clock to save people affected by the Kashmir floods has turned a deaf ear to the sufferings, supplication and pleadings of the affected people in Bhopal for appropriate relief.

It is unbelievable that the clean-up of the pesticides factory and its surroundings was not done in all these years. I don’t think there can be any country so callous and lethargic as to not clean up such poisonous wastes that continue to be the source of suffering and deaths.

Its name has always intrigued us: Brahma’s Son. So this time, before we flew to the northeast, we decided to decipher it. One belief, we learnt, spoke of a drop of Brahma’s blood falling into a sacred fire. “ From which, by the will of Siva, sprang Rudra, of dark hue, with five heads, 10 hands and 15 eyes. Having seen such a son, Brahma was delighted (but he) said, ‘Why dost thou not also adore me?’ Rudra replied ‘I worship none other than that effulgence from which I sprang!’ Having thus spoken, he departed to Siva’s abode.”

We believe that most such legends contain scientific truths wrapped in easy-to-remember parables. Protected by the aura of sanctity, they are passed unchanged down the generations. Here, the mythic references could be descriptions of five sources (headwaters!), 10 tributaries and 15 glistening peaks in the highlands of Tibet. It could also explain the fact that the son, the putra , of Brahma, the Creator, is dark and turgid with silt, and as destructive as Siva, when it is in spate.

It had just got over its yearly tumultuous phase and was laying down banks of fertile soil, when we encountered it at Assam’s Nimati ghat . Our ferry put-putted across the cocoa-brown river, shouldering aside floating debris, and nestled into the side of Assam Bengal Navigation’s RV Charaidew . This 14-cabin river-cruise ship would be our home, shared with well-informed tourists from Britain, for the next week. We would sail down-river to Kaziranga, stopping every day to explore the lush banks and the hinterland.

That is how we encountered three mysteries of this implacable river. The first was a temple, with an enormous beehive-shaped conical dome, standing beside a vast, man-made reservoir reputedly dug in 1754. “Who created these?” we asked. “The Ahoms,” our guide said. The Ahoms had also built a tall grandstand to view feats of strength between animals and men. Then, on a breeze-trapping knoll, they had erected their sturdy fortress. Sadly, however, they had not left behind a single carving, sculpture or painting to show what they looked like. After holding onto their domain against the onslaught of the Mughals and the British, they vanished. We are not sure if they had come from Myanmar or China and we don’t know where they went. All we are sure about is that they left their silent monuments behind and gave their name to their state: Assam.

The next was a cheerful, riverine tribe living in bamboo huts built on stilts at the river’s edge. The Mishings have adapted their lifestyles to the moods of the river. They farm its fertile flood-plains and raise their herds of pigs between the stilts of their huts where they also set up their handlooms. They climb effortlessly to their huts using notched bamboo ladders, and their hearths lie in the centre of the bamboo-matting floors insulated by a plaster of river mud. “What do you do when the river destroys your huts and fields?” we asked. They shrugged and smiled, “We move to a safer place and rebuild them, as our ancestors have always done!” Some people believe that the Mishings came from Arunachal. We prefer another theory. We believe that that they were, originally, a Tibetan people who have, over the centuries, followed the course of the river, adapting themselves to its vagaries. Today their lives are so closely entwined with the great river that they cannot think of moving away from it. The Mishings are, in every way, the People of the River.

Finally, on the world’s largest riverine island, we encountered a remarkable faith. Here, in 1516, came polymath genius Sankaradeva. Like Gautama Siddhartha centuries before him, he revolted against the self-serving rituals and enforced sacrifices of the priestly class. Fearing that his unorthodox tenets would destroy their livelihood, they persecuted him, forcing him to flee to Majoli Island. Here he established a faith based on artistic expression. He wanted his people, including his monks, to be entirely self-supporting and not be parasites on society. They expressed their worship in dancing, music, songs, poetry, creating masks for religious theatre, and tapestry. For good administration, he established self-governing village societies were everyone met in community halls called naam ghars , without any idols, and under the guidance of a mentor. Here, they resolved their problems, shunning the intervention of outsiders. It provided the ideal of maximum governance, but no government. It continues to serve this purpose, centuries after Sankaradeva conceived it within the moated protection of the Brahmaputra. Now, however, the gradual erosion of Majoli has forced the monasteries to carry their message to the mainland.

Clearly, the river continues to play its finely balanced role of destruction for re-creation.

475,2624,hyderabad,2014,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/islamic-scholar-abdul-qavi-arrested-in-gujarats-isi-conspiracy-case/,24 Mar 2014,Islamic scholar Abdul Qavi arrested in Gujarat’s ISI conspiracy case,"The Ahmedabad Crime Branch allegedly picked up Hyderabad-based Islamic theologian Maulana Abdul Qavi from Delhi airport on Sunday for his alleged role in the ‘2003 jihadi conspiracy’ or ISI conspiracy, which was allegedly hatched by Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad to avenge the 2002 Godhra riots.

Abdul Qavi (58) was brought to Ahmedabad early on Monday after he was produced in a local court in Delhi. Qavi is the rector of Jamia Ashraf Uloom in Hyderabad and has written several religious books. He is a resident of Khwajabaug in Saidabad locality of Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh.

He was picked up from the airport soon after his flight from Hyderabad landed in New Delhi terminal. Qavi was served a notice from the Ahmedabad Crime Branch to appear before the police, however, after he ignored all their summons, a team of Ahmedabad Crime Branch officers kept a close-watch on him in the last few months. After they received a tip off that Qavi was going to Delhi to attend a religious event called ‘Deeni Madarais’ at the Darool Uloom Deoband in Delhi, the team apprehended him.

Crime Branch Chief, Jt Commissioner of Police AK Sharma told The Indian Express, “Qavi was wanted in the jihadi conspiracy from 2003 that has resulted in the murder of Haren Pandya, blasts in AMTS buses of Ahmedabad, tiffin box blasts and firing at Jagdish Tiwari. Of the two modules (Hyderabad and Gujarat) that worked behind the recruitment of Muslim boys for terrorism and execution of the conspiracy in Gujarat, Qavi was one of the chief accused who recruited boys on instructions of terrorist Sharif Khan who is now believed to be hiding in Pakistan”.

The crime branch added that both the Gujarat and Hyderabad modules were found to be recruiting Muslim boys from Gujarat and they were illegally sent to Pakistan after crossing the borders from Gujarat for training under Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad training camps.

JCP Sharma added that out of the 56 accused, 42 are still absconding. He said, “Qavi was mentioned as one of the accused in the jihadi conspiracy case along with Dawood Ibrahim and Rasool. The court had issued several warrants for his arrest, however, Qavi kept evading appearing before Gujarat Police”.

The ‘ISI conspiracy case’ is an umbrella case covering five crimes, including tiffin box bombings, Pandya murder and others, as riot reprisal events planned by the ISI.

The crime branch led by encounter specialist DG Vanzara in 2003 launched a special investigation into terrorist-related cases in Gujarat post 2002, stating that the cases were a part of the ‘ISI conspiracy’ case to avenge the 2002 Godhra riots in Gujarat. Vanzara, who is now lodged in Sabarmati Central Jail for Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case, had claimed that under the leadership of Mufti Sufiyan Patangia and Rasool Party, Muslim boys were recruited by LeT and JeM from Madrasas and other centres in Gujarat.

Qavi, who is a popular name among the youth in Hyderabad, is also alleged to have recruited boys from Hyderabad for LeT and JeM. Qavi is one of the key accused who is also alleged to have pushed boys to Bangladesh for terrorist training camps.

His elder brother, Maulana Mufti Abdul Ghani, is the president of Jamiat-e-Ulma-e-Hind in Hyderabad. Sources added that a few years back, Qavi’s nephew, Maulana Mohammad Ashraf was arrested from Hyderabad for terror links, however, he was later released by the court.

Qavi is wanted under the Indian Penal Code Sections 120(B), 121, 121 (a), 122, 123 for criminal conspiracy, collecting arms and waging war against the nation. He is also wanted under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (2002) and Section 25, 27 and 29 of the Arms Act.

According to sources, Qavi’s phones were seized along with the phones of a few youth who were reportedly accompanying him. He was allegedly not allowed to talk to his family and was taken to Ahmedabad without intimating his family. Qavi’s brother, Mufti Abdul Ghani, sought help from Maulana Syed Mahmood Madani, General Secretary of the Jamiat-e-Ulma-e-Hind in New Delhi calling his brother’s arrest ‘illegal’.

The crime branch has begun questioning the accused in their custody. The sources added that his family in Hyderabad has taken strong objection to his arrest while the crime branch received calls from several youth leaders and students from Hyderabad protesting against his arrest.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Strongly condemn attempts to brand me an outsider: Sania Mirza

""I was born in Mumbai as my mother needed to be at a specialist hospital since she was seriously unwell at the time of my birth. I came home to Hyderabad when I was 3 weeks old.

Trending Now

Hyderabad, Jul 24 : Indian tennis star Sania Mirza today hit out at politicians for raising objections to her being appointed as Telangana‘s brand ambassador, saying that her family had been staying in Hyderabad for more than a century and to call her an outsider was condemnable. Sania was named the brand ambassador of the newly-created state on Tuesday, a move that triggered a political furore. The opposition BJP started the controversy by saying that Sania does not deserve the honour as she is the “daughter-in-law of Pakistan” after her marriage to cricketer Shoaib Malik.

“It hurts me that so much precious time of prominent politicians and the media is being wasted on a petty issue of my being appointed the Brand Ambassador of my State of Telangana. I sincerely believe that this precious time should be spent on solving the more urgent issues of our State and country,” Sania said in a statement. Asserting her Hyderabadi roots, Sania said her ancestors had contributed to the city and her marriage to Malik does not take away the fact that she remains an Indian citizen.

“I am married to Mr. Shoaib Malik, who is from Pakistan. I am an Indian, who will remain an Indian until the end of my life,” the 27-year-old insisted. “I was born in Mumbai as my mother needed to be at a specialist hospital since she was seriously unwell at the time of my birth. I came home to Hyderabad when I was 3 weeks old. “My forefathers have lived in Hyderabad for more than a century. My grandfather, Mr. Mohammed Zaffer Mirza started his career as an Engineer in Nizam’s Railways in Hyderabad in 1948 and died in his ancestral home in Hyderabad,” she said.

Sania also spoke about her great grandfather Mohd. Ahmed Mirza, insisting that he “was also born and raised in Hyderabad. He was the Chief Engineer, Water Works, Hyderabad and was responsible for constructing the famous Gandipet dam.” “My great, great grandfather, Mr. Aziz Mirza was the Home Secretary under the Nizam in Hyderabad and worked tirelessly for relief works during the historic Musi River floods of 1908.”

Sania said it was hurtful to hear comments which sought to brand her as an outsider. “So, my family belongs to Hyderabad for more than a century and I strongly condemn any attempts by any person, whosoever, to brand me an outsider. I hope this clears all doubts and issues,” she said. Telangana BJP leader K Laxman had flayed the TRS government’s decision to appoint Sania as brand ambassador, questioning her credentials for the honour.

The tennis player had never participated in agitation for a separate state of Telangana, said Laxman who is leader of BJP in Telangana legislative assembly. Handing over a grant of Rs 1 crore here on Tuesday, Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao appointed Sania as brand ambassador of Telangana and described her as a daughter of Hyderabad.

477,2626,hyderabad,2014,https://www.dawn.com/news/1132055,15 Sept 2014,Chenab now torments south Punjab,"LAHORE: As the furious Chenab River extended its rampage to south Punjab on Sunday, more rain over the badly bruised north-eastern parts of the province claimed another seven lives.

The seven people belonging to two families were killed in Hafizabad’s Abdullahpur village as the soaked roofs of their houses could not endure the burden of the wall of an adjacent rice mill collapsed during a severe rainstorm.

The storm also lashed several cities and towns from Sialkot to Lahore regions and triggered panic among people, reminding them of the large-scale devastation caused by a three-day rainy spell and floods in the eastern rivers about 10 days ago.

At least 197 people died because of rains and floods, especially in Chenab, till Saturday. And the latest casualties, including 17 in Multan, took the death toll to 219.

The authorities blew up the Doaba spur on Sunday to save the town of Muzaffargarh. Another breach in Muradabad and Thatta Sialan spurs flooded Muradabad and Bhutrapur areas on the outskirts of Muzaffargarh. Hundreds of homes and crops over a large area were damaged by the breach in Thatta Sialan and the floodwater entered Tulheri Canal and some parts of the town.

Water discharge at Panjnad headworks was falling after touching a peak of 371,000 cusecs, probably because of breaches upstream near Multan and Muzaffargarh.

Our Multan correspondent adds: The water level at Head Muhammadwala and Bund Bosan started receding, but it was high at Shujabad and Jalalpur.

RAIN: Rain in Lahore was brief but heavy around the airport. It was accompanied by a dust storm which uprooted a number of trees and brought billboards down. Low-lying areas were inundated. The Met office recorded 32mm of rain at the airport and 12mm at the Jail Road observatory and said it was produced by a westerly wave.

Islamabad’s Zero Point received 46mm rain and airport 27mm, Mandi Bahauddin 37mm, Sargodha 35mm, Garhi Dupatta 30mm, Mangla 25mm, Sialkot airport 16mm and Cantt 12mm, Chakwal and Jhelum 14mm each, Jauharabad 10mm, Gujrat 9mm, Kasur 8mm, Rawlakot 7mm and Gujranwala and Murree 5mm each. The Met department forecast isolated thunderstorm/rain with heavy falls over Sahiwal, Faisalabad, Lahore, Sargodha, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Kohat, Hazara, Peshawar, Islamabad, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir over the next 24 hours.

There are chances of isolated rain over Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, Bahawalpur, Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, Kalat, Naseerabad, Sibbi, Quetta, Zhob, Karachi, Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas and Fata and land-sliding in hilly areas.

The Flood Forecasting Division said the rain over the catchment of Jhelum River sent 100,000 cusecs of water to Mangla Dam which was released downstream because the dam was already filled to capacity.

Chenab was in high flood at Panjnad where the discharge at 9pm was 363,000 cusecs and was likely to rise to 450,000 to 500,000 cusecs.

The FFD, which had earlier said the discharge could rise to 700,000 cusecs, revised the estimates on Sunday because of the diversion of floodwater owing to several breaches made near Jhang and Multan over the past three days.

The high flood (71,000 cusecs) in the Ravi at Sidhnai started receding and falling into the Chenab upstream Panjnad.

The FFD forecast high to very high flood in the Indus River at Guddu on Monday and Tuesday and at Sukkur on Wednesday and Thursday after the peak in Chenab would fall downstream Panjnad.

The Inter-Services Public Relations said the army’s rescue and relief operations continued in the flood-hit areas of Multan, Muzaffargarh, Uch Sharif, Bahawalpur and Athara Hazari. About 73,000 people have been rescued by 300 boats. Army helicopters dropped 80 tons of ration and the affected people are being treated at its medical camps.

Smaller States have been the new political mode of addressing basic issues that were otherwise left unresolved. However, fighting for a new state and reconstructing on a more sustainable democratic content are undoubtedly two different issues all together. One does not automatically promise the other, if there is anything to learn from the previous history of smaller States in India.

The premise of carving out smaller States in India shifted from the formation of linguistic states to one of, since the 1990s, rearranging them on the basis of backwardness and a lack of development. However, even a cursory look at how Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have fared will tell us how the mere formation of a smaller State is no guarantee for better lives for those social groups for whom these States have been created. Uttarakhand continues to be at the lower end in the Human Development Index. There was abject callousness in dealing with the recent floods, focussing solely on how to make it more tourist-friendly rather than planning for the rehabilitation of displaced residents. There was little concern demonstrated for the “local” people in whose name the State was created.

Chhattisgarh has witnessed the largest displacement of tribals in recent times. There have been sustained attempts to dispossess them of their land which they have inhabited for centuries in order to extract mineral wealth. Even as tribals were ostensibly empowered by the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act (PESA), there were attempts to invoke the clause of Eminent Domain, in the name of national interest. The displacement of tribals was in fact “outsourced” by the State to vigilante groups formed through what was depicted as a spontaneous uprising called “Salwa Judum” — in effect an organised effort by non-tribals and traders from outside the State. How did they get the better of the tribals in whose name the State was created? Jharkhand turned out to be perhaps the worst of the three. With hardly any agenda of development worth mentioning, the State turned into a mining hell of “predatory growth,” eventually resulting in a series of scams and criminal proceedings being initiated against the first tribal Chief Minister of the State. Thus, how optimistic can one get about Telangana?

When States remain backward for long, they are ushered in to create new growth in order to catch up with the rest. While this kind of growth-centric discourse has been the rhetoric of the neo-liberal economy for the last three decades, it neatly overlaps with the aspirations that lie behind the creation of smaller States. However, the nature of the economy in these States remains distinct, since they are latecomers. The lack of industry, an agrarian crisis and a low level of infrastructural facilities push such States into adopting a model of development where growth can be achieved in spite of these handicaps. This, as we witnessed with the examples of the three smaller States, results in an unprecedented exploitation of raw materials such as the mining of minerals instead of the creation of industry, wanton land deals, a boost to the construction industry and the conversion of fertile agricultural land into speculative real estate transactions, since agriculture in any case was untenable and non-profitable.

Alongside these possibilities, Telangana has also been a haven for liquor contractors since a large chunk of State revenue is from liquor contracts. Civil, liquor and mining contractors have come to constitute the dominant, economic elite and the political class. Added to this speculative nature of the economy — especially in the case of Telangana — is the excessive concentration of resources in the capital city of Hyderabad. Since Hyderabad is already well-developed in terms of infrastructure, there remains little possibility of developing other smaller towns for the purpose of economic investments. It is precisely for this reason that the clamour over Hyderabad is detrimental to the interests of other backward districts in the region. Therefore, it is reasonable to bring into question how such a model of growth will be able to address the aspirations of the various social groups that have mobilised themselves relentlessly in a struggle for a separate state of Telangana. Will this model be able to address the impending agrarian crisis that has resulted in scores of farmer suicides? Will it provide employment to the students who formed the backbone of the movement? Will it provide relief to artisans and other nascent non-farm sectors in the rural hinterland? Finally, will it be able to create new avenues to stop massive migration that many districts of Telangana have witnessed in the last three decades?

On the political front too there are many challenges that Telangana will have to face, and this dream of a “New Telangana” that was ushered in by the leaders needs closer introspection — something that has been missing so far from the discourse. With a clear possibility of an alliance, after Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader K. Chandrasekhar Rao rejected the idea of a merger between the TRS and the Congress, there will be no regional alternative left in the State except for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) that has not done well electorally in the last decade or so. This will undoubtedly open up new space for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that has also championed the cause of Telangana.

Telangana was ruled by the Nizam, and most of the districts have a Muslim population not less than 13-14 per cent. Added to this is the imagination among the Muslim population that they once upon a time in history belonged to the ruling elite. It is this imagination that is always invoked by the likes of All India Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi and his brother, Akbaruddin Owaisi. While as rhetoric it might provide a sense of security for the Muslims, it also creates fertile ground for the agenda of Hindutva and a politics of polarising Hindus and Muslims along religious lines. In fact, the BJP sees Telangana as its second stop in South India, after Karnataka. While the dominant castes of Reddys and Velamas constitute the leadership of the TRS and the Congress, there is a distinct possibility of the BJP shifting ground to mobilise the Other Backward Classes, weaning them away from the TDP. Along with the conservative Brahminical social elite, OBCs and even Dalits could be the social base of the BJP to pursue its Hindutva dream, leaving Telangana with no democratic social force that could counter its divisive agenda.

The sentiment of being deprived in a backward region and culturally subjugated and victimised are grounds for the demand for a separate state that can very easily be mobilised, once a new State is formed, against imagined aggressors within the State. It is for this reason that the MIM has been opposed to the demand for a separate State — an issue that was put on the back burner by the leaders championing the cause of Telangana, never looking for ways of addressing it.

In fact, when Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao once recalled the legacy of the Nizam, which was in any case problematic, it led to massive disapproval. The history of the Telangana struggle of the 1940s and the popular memory of the atrocities committed by the Razakars, the private army unleashed by the Nizam, continue to haunt public and political debate in the region, conveniently forgetting that the landlords who sided with the Razakars belonged to the now dominant Reddy and Velama castes. Much of the public campaign of the BJP in the region, alongside the demand for Telangana, was fashioned around this selective construction of history. Another Muzaffarnagar or a Gujarat cannot be ruled out in the near future in the “New” Telangana.

479,2628,hyderabad,2014,https://www.dawn.com/news/1148067,1 Dec 2014,Why Karachi will keep flooding,"There was a time just 50 years ago when it scarcely rained in Karachi, Pakistan’s industrial and commercial hub and seaport; just a shower every few years if residents were lucky.

From the late 70s, however, rains are more frequent as are floods in the sprawling 1,400 square mile city of 21 million people, one of the world’s biggest in terms of both area and population.

Traffic stalls with roads being waterlogged and there’s serious risk of falling into open manholes and drowning. The flood may be localised when it rains in only part of Karachi, but it nonetheless disrupts the lives and livelihoods of thousands of people.

Is global warming responsible?

“Global warming exists. That’s obvious by all the changes we see and experience — consensus only varies as to its extent,” said internationally acclaimed architect, urban planner and environmentalist Arif Hasan, who is a leading authority on Karachi.

He does not find the increased frequency of rains extraordinary.

“Looking at the rainfall figures, I can say with certainty that the present floods have nothing to do with climate change. Not even minor. The figures keep going up and down. There is no regular pattern. We’ve had periods of far more intense flooding during the devastation of 2010. It rained frequently during the 70s. Karachi’s Lyari river frequently overflowed previously, but the city didn’t drown.”

Then why does it drown now?

“Major outlets to the sea were blocked,” he explained. A bypass, for instance, was built at the junction of two major natural drainage channels to replace the flood plains. It was a narrow and inadequate 60-feet-wide drain flowing into a creek leading directly to the sea. During the rains, it can’t cope with the volume.

This is in the Clifton area, adjacent to the Defence Housing Authority, home to many of the city’s most affluent who seek to live as close as possible to the ocean. As a result, the upscale residential area now dominates the city’s coastal area, covering almost 14 square miles and growing relentlessly.

The problem is that most of Karachi’s waste-water and sewage is channeled into the sea, so there’s no avoiding cutting through DHA to get there.

“Another major drainage channel flows into a similar creek (Gizri creek). Its one-and-a-half kilometre wide floodplain was replaced by an 80 feet drain! The area never flooded before; now it does. Why? Because DHA converted the floodplain into a residential area. When rains occur during high tide, the water can’t get out because the tide pushes back the rainwater into the drain, blocking it from exiting,” Hasan added.

Other contributing factors are scores of encroachments in the form of ‘katchi abadis’, or informal settlements.

When it rains heavily, many of these are inundated because they are built on floodplains. The most recent case is of Saadi town which was completely submerged last year and all but disappeared.

An unsatisfactory sewerage system compounds Karachi’s woes.

Existing sewage processing plants have only one-fourth the capacity to treat what Karachi generates.

“These could process more of Karachi’s sewage — if it only reached those plants! Their capacity is 150 million gallons, but only 30 million reaches. The rest, about 400 million gallons, goes into the sea.”

Storm-water drains double as outlets for sewage which mixes with city floodwaters, creating serious health hazards.

“The city simply has to get rid of the Defence housing colony that’s encroached on a mangrove strip and the Mai Kolachi Bypass road (in Clifton)… There’s no other way,” Hasan said.

Public protests led by environmentalists have failed to save the mangroves.

The once vast mangrove forests have been progressively shrinking. The resultant heavy pollution has threatened shrimp nurseries and the livelihoods of local fishing communities.

“The whole area now stinks, and there’s no mechanism to get the sewage properly flushed out,” said Noman Ahmed, head of the department of architecture, NED University. Eventually, the smell may drive residents away.

“People who reside there or are thinking of moving into DHA reclaimed area should think twice,” warned Noman, “DHA Phase 8 alone is about 4,000 acres, the bulk of it from reclamation. To do it scientifically is very expensive. Instead, quicksand and marshy areas were consolidated by simply dumping and compacting earth. That’s not good enough. In any seismic activity, cracks may appear in buildings and infrastructure with serious consequences. Yet, now they’re thinking of reclaiming even more.”

The same mistakes were made by other major cities — Bombay, Dhaka, Bangkok and, in the nineteenth century, New York, London and Paris. Drainage channels were closed and canals and creeks built over them.

“But the big difference between those western cities and us is that those were small populations, making it easier to correct,” Hasan said. “Today, Karachi is the world’s fastest growing city.”

“Planners know the problems but are unable to act on them for political reasons. Different parts of Karachi are controlled by various ethnic groups and political parties that don’t see eye-to-eye. Karachi comes under 13 different administrations that don’t coordinate with each other — Cantonment Boards, Port Trust, Civil Aviation Authority, industrial estates, housing societies, etc… Everything is done ad hoc.”

There are endless delays in implementing sanctioned plans. The financial constraints keep mounting with the steadily increasing population in the urban sprawl.

“There’s still no overall authority in Karachi to control construction… or to prevent damaging changes,” said architect and activist Roland deSouza.

Misbahuddin Farid, former head of the Karachi Water & Sewerage Board (KWSB), agreed.

“Nobody even considers KWSB a stakeholder, so we’re not even consulted. I’ve brought up the matter often, even with the chief minister, to no avail.”

Surely things have come to a head by now?

“It’s a political problem, not a planning one,” said Hasan, “City government planners are highly qualified and know all this. The biggest problem is that politicians are not aware and don’t inform themselves. It is ignorance and the lack of desire to know. They don’t see it because it doesn’t happen to them. The planners, the best informed, have no independence. If they assert themselves, they can be sacked or transferred to doing nothing of consequence. So they keep quiet to retain their jobs or leave for jobs elsewhere.”

“In the coming 50, 100 years, global warming may cause greater rainfall and aggravate matters. But whether there’s global warming or not, unless these problems are resolved, Karachi will keep flooding.”

Ironically, Karachi also suffers chronic water shortage, a problem that impacts the entire country. Pakistan, overall, is getting more water than ever before, from both increasing floods and rains.

“Yet our water storage can hardly meet a month of our needs,” said ecologist and energy expert Parvaiz Naim. His key concern, he stressed, was that the “lack of adequate water storage facilities exposes us to floods when we get more rains, and droughts when we get less. Pakistan needs to go for adaptation measures.”

480,2629,hyderabad,2014,https://www.dawn.com/news/1146444,24 Nov 2014,"High child mortality rate in Thar no new phenomenon, say experts","KARACHI: Medical experts based in Tharparkar and Karachi rejected on Sunday what the media had been describing as a continuing humanitarian crisis in Thar due to increasing number of children’s deaths and said the desert region had had the highest under five years mortality rate in Pakistan for the past three decades and there had been no extraordinary change in it so far.

Similar conditions prevailed in other poverty stricken areas of Pakistan including some parts of Karachi, experts pointed out as, according to them, the country has the third highest burden of maternal, fetal and child mortality in the world.

“Thar has the highest under-five mortality rate in Pakistan with 90 to 100 deaths per 1,000 live births. There has been no change in the statistics in three decades,” said Dr Zulfiqar Bhutta, a recipient of the United Nations award on child health and founding director of the Centre of Excellence in Women and Child Health at Aga Khan University.

‘The desert region also has the highest rate of under-five mortality in the country’

Elaborating the issue, he said that the 1.5m population of Tharparkar with a conservative growth rate of 3pc would likely have 45,000 births annually, of which almost 40pc would be low birth weight.

“With an expected neonatal mortality rate of 45-50 per thousand, Tharparkar should have between 4,000 and 4,500 under-five deaths every year, almost half of them newborn infants.

“If the media is reporting 500-800 deaths in four months, this is not unexpected and hence my premise is that this whole focus is on a chronic longstanding issue that is periodically unearthed and highlighted but needs solutions which are long term,” he said.

The region, he pointed out, also had the highest fertility and malnutrition rate in mothers and children for decades but the media reported the issue in a sensationalised way.

Referring to the devastating 2010 floods that forced a huge population living in acute poverty for decades in the interior of Sindh to migrate to Karachi, he said that at that time what the people saw (abject poverty and severe malnourishment in migrant mothers and children) was a chronic problem that remained hidden from public view for a long time.

It needs to be recalled that the media has so far reported 109 deaths in Tharparkar that included 102 children in 52 days.

The deaths are being blamed on the prevailing drought that has led to food shortage and malnutrition, it is said. More than 90 per cent of these deaths involved newborns.

Dr Bhutta, however, believes a number of factors are playing a role in the situation that has been persisting in Thar for ages. They included malnourishment in mothers and children, lack of immunisation and access to antenatal care and health facilities.

“Although appropriate birth-spacing is important for both mother and newborn, it’s common for Thari women to have 10 to 15 children as there is no concept of family planning in that area.

“The basic fault lies with the government that couldn’t take required measures to improve maternal and newborn health over the years,” he said.

Thar, he said, needed more official attention as life in the desert was entirely dependent on seasonal rains which explained why the area suffered from frequent droughts and faced chronic water shortage.

“But in some parts of the world droughts, more severe than what we are experiencing in Thar, are being affectively managed. One case is of California where the government has devised strategies including that of water conservation and livelihood diversification to address the problem,” he said.

Suggesting measures, he said that birth asphyxia, pneumonia, diarrhoea, infection and prematurity were five major killers of under-five children in Pakistan that the government needed to focus upon on a priority basis.

“It should make immediate efforts to scale up immunisation in Thar and bring it to 90 to 100pc, make health facilities functional with trained staff, make available required equipment and medicines and focus on preventive healthcare and delivery of quality primary healthcare. Family planning should be a vital part of this process that should run on sustainable basis.”

Citing AKUH projects in Matiari and Dadu for maternal and newborn health, he said that low-cost efficient interventions reduced child mortality rate by 20pc in Matiari in just one and a half years.

“That was in no way a small achievement if you look at Pakistan’s progress in this field. There has only been a 26pc reduction in 30 years in child mortality in the country,” he said, adding that lessons learnt in these districts could be replicated in other parts of the country.

Sharing similar thoughts, senior obstetrician and founder of Pakistan National Forum on Women Health Dr Shershah Syed said: “If you visit parts of Karachi like Machhar Colony, Chamra Colony and Orangi, you’ll find that a similar number of children dying in these areas and other parts of Pakistan, for instance, Skardu, which I have just visited, that are being reported from Thar.”

Dr Shershah believed that the media hype on Thar could be an attempt to remove the incumbent chief minister.

Newborns, he said, did not die of malnutrition but of bacterial and viral infections that were all very common in Pakistani population. “With the onset of winter, children would now be vulnerable to pneumonia,” he added.

Dr Najma Khoso, the only gynaecologist working in the public sector in Nagarparkar taluka, said that the problem in Thar was related to poverty, lack of medical facilities and education.

Two important reasons for the newborn’s death, she said, were prematurity and neonatal sepsis, that could be addressed to a great extent if the pregnant women received quality antenatal and delivery care.

“85 per cent of our population lives in remote areas, far away from health facilities and by the time a patient reaches a health facility, it’s too late. So, there is a need to expand healthcare system and make already functioning health units efficient,” she said.

Dr Rabia Malik, a gynaecologist working at Mithi Civil Hospital, also stressed the need for antenatal care and family support during pregnancy and said that many mortalities were cases of pre-term and mishandled deliveries.

“Out of 130 delivery cases in a month, 50 involved mishandling by traditional birth attendants and quacks that are operating in large numbers here. Birth in unhygienic conditions is an important reason for newborn infection. Majority of pregnant women in Thar generally have no antenatal care and families take too much time in bringing the patient in critical state to a health facility,” she said.

Faiz Mohammad Junejo, a primary teacher heading and an office-bearer of the Baanhn Beli, a non-governmental organisation operating in Thar, was of the opinion that the deaths reported by media were a reality but they had to do more with government mismanagement than food shortage.

“In the 44 union councils of Thar, there are only two gynaecologists, one of them recently appointed by the government. Illnesses are common as poor people are deprived of access to clean drinking water. Despite the fact that water scarcity has been persisting here for ages, the government has very recently started work on reverse osmosis plants.

“Drought conditions have been prevailing in Thar for the past two years and what could be declared in crisis are the livestock that provide sustenance to villagers,” he said.

The answers to these questions vary widely depending on who is being asked. A large part of our national identity stems from our sense of history and culture that are deeply rooted in the land and in the legacy of the region’s ancient civilisations. Religion has also played a big part in making us what we are today. But the picture general history textbooks paint for us does not portray the various facets of our identity.





Instead it offers quite a convoluted description of who we are. The distortion of historical facts has in turn played a quintessential role in manipulating our sense of self. What’s ironic is that the boldest fallacies in these books are about the events that are still in our living memory.

Herald invited writers and commentators, well versed in history, to share their answers to what they believe is the most blatant lie taught through Pakistan history textbooks.





The fundamental divide between Hindus and Muslims

The most blatant lie in Pakistan Studies textbooks is the idea that Pakistan was formed solely because of a fundamental conflict between Hindus and Muslims. This idea bases itself on the notion of a civilisational divide between monolithic Hindu and Muslim identities, which simply did not exist.

The stress on religion ignored other factors that could cut across both identities. For instance, a Muslim from most of South India had far more in common, because of his regionally specific culture and language, with Hindus in this area than the Muslims in the north of the Subcontinent.





Similarly, the division of the historical narrative into a ‘Hindu’ and ‘Muslim’ period, aside from the ironic fact that this was actually instituted by the British, glosses over the reality that Islamic empires also fought each other for power. After all, Babar had to defeat Ibrahim Lodhi, and thus, the Delhi Sultanate, for the Mughal period to begin.

Therefore, power and empire building often trumped this religious identity, that textbooks claim, can be traced linearly right to the formation of Pakistan.





These textbooks tend to have snapshot descriptions of the contempt with which the two religious communities treated one another. This is specifically highlighted in descriptions of the Congress ministries formed after the elections of 1937.

Other factors that contributed historically to these shows of religious ‘contempt’ in South Asian history are often ignored. Indeed, Richard Eaton’s classic study of temple desecrations shows that in almost all cases where Hindu temples were ransacked, it was for political or economic reasons.

In most cases, it was because the Muslim ruler was punishing an insubordinate Hindu official. Otherwise, the Mughals protected such temples. Jumping ahead, this sort of inter-communal cooperation aimed at maintaining political control could also be seen in the Unionist Party, which was in power in Punjab all the way up until 1946.

As Pakistan was formed barely a year later, the notion that its formation was based on a long-standing and fundamental conflict between Hindus and Muslims is deeply problematic.

Eulogising leaders

In his preface to the Muqaddimah, Ibn Khaldun warned of seven mistakes that he thought historians often committed. One of the seven is “the common desire to gain favour of those of high ranks, by praising them, by spreading their fame.”

This particular mistake, or lie rather, has plagued history writing for school texts in Pakistan since the 1950s and has been used as a political tool to project successive rulers – whether civilian or military – in a eulogistic format.





Moreover, another mindless inaccuracy is the absence of the ‘other’, where India and Congress are needlessly ignored and a one-sided version of history is deemed necessary for creating a nationalistic mindset.

This gap continues in the historical narrative for school students post-partition. Hence, some of the most blatant lies and subversion of historical facts exist in the textbooks mandated by the federal and provincial textbook boards.

Furthermore, maligning the ‘enemy’ is done quite overtly and mindlessly in official history school texts which, unfortunately, is also the case with some Indian school texts documented by discerning authors on both sides of the border.





Most nation states during the 19th and 20th centuries used official versions of history in order to create a homogenous and nationalistic identity. Pakistan’s first education minister, Fazalur Rehman, set up the Historical Society of Pakistan in 1948 so that history for the new nation could be rewritten in a fair and balanced manner using authentic and reliable sources.

Successive governments did not further this goal and history written for schools in Pakistan became the victim of fossilised textbook boards ratifying the work of unethical and unscholarly authors for public school consumption. Vested interests continue to triumph despite the open door policy since 2004 for private publishers to bid for quality textbooks.

Excluding and manipulating historical periods

The most blatant lie in textbook accounts of Pakistan’s history is by virtue of omission, which is in effect the denial of our multicultural, multi-ethnic and multi-religious past. It is a common complaint that Pakistan’s history is taught as if it began with the conquest of Sindh by the Umayyad army, led by the young General, Muhammad bin Qasim in 711 AD.

Most textbooks in Sindh at least do mention Moenjodaro and the Indus Valley civilisation, but it is not discussed in a meaningful way and there is no discussion about its extent and culture. Important periods and events during subsequent centuries are also skimmed over, like the Aryan civilisation which introduced its powerful social system and epic poetry (Mahabharata in which Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa play important roles), the Brahmin religion, a thousand years of Buddhism with its universities and the Gandharan civilisation which was spread throughout present day Pakistan.





No students of Pakistani schools can tell us that Pakistan was once part of the empires of Cyrus the Great and Darius of the Achaemenid Dynasty and later of the Sassanian Empire with the legendary rule of Naushirwan, “the Just”. Similarly, hardly anyone would be aware that Asoka whose capital was in Pataliputra in the east of the subcontinent also counted Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab as part of his domain.





The result of these omissions is disastrous on the minds of the youth in Pakistan. Instead of seeing themselves as heirs of many civilisations, they acquire a narrow, one-dimensional view of the world. This is contradicted by what they subsequently see in this global world of information technology and shared knowledge. That this is also in direct contravention of Islamic teachings does not occur to the perpetrators of a lopsided curriculum in our schools.

The first assertion in the Holy Quran is Iqra bi Ism I Rabik [and no restrictions are put on the acquisition of knowledge].





Instead, we have bans on books, digital platforms such as YouTube and even newspapers in this Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

The other view

Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Liaquat Ali Khan accompanied by members of Muslim League.

To say a large part of Pakistan’s history is shared with India would be stating the obvious. Yet it is this period of both our histories, or the portrayal of such, that is tampered with the most and has been used as a political tool by either side. The Herald invited renowned Indian historian and currently a Jawaharlal Nehru Fellow, Mushirul Hasan, to give his take on the lies taught through textbooks on both sides of the border.





History is only of use for its lessons, and it is the duty of the historian to see that they are properly taught. Very few in the subcontinent heed this advice. Both in India and Pakistan the intellectual climate has thrown the historical profession into disarray.

Such is the power and influence of the polemicists that a growing number of people are abandoning the quest for an objective approach. With the recent appointment of a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-oriented Chairman of the Indian Council for Historical Research, liberal and secular historians are worried about the future of their discipline.





The diversity of approaches has been the hallmark of Indian historiography. As a result, the making of Pakistan and its evolution as a nation state is interpreted differently in various quarters.

The ghosts of partition was put to rest and not exhumed for frequent post-mortems. Moreover, the liberal-left historians did not repudiate the idea of Pakistan. On the contrary, they criticised the Congress stalwarts for failing to guide the movements they initiated away from the forces of reactionary communalism.

This was true of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Ram Manohar Lohia, the Socialist leader. The Maulana, in particular, charged Nehru for jettisoning the plan for a Congress-Muslim coalition in 1937 and the prospect of an enduring Hindu-Muslim partnership.





Tara Chand’s three-volume History of the Freedom Movement in India held its ground until the Janata government decided, in 1977, to rewrite the secular textbook. With the establishment of the BJP-led government in October 1999, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-RSS combination began its subversion of academia through its time-tested method of infiltration and rewriting of textbooks and ‘fine-tuning’ of curricula.

Saffronisation of education will breed fanaticism, heighten caste and communitarian consciousness, and stifle the natural inclination of a student to cultivate a balanced and cautious judgement. Increasingly, it may be difficult for some of us to establish historical truths or to defend the cult of objective historical inquiry.





As the radical currents are being swept aside by the winds of right-wing discourse, it is pertinent to recall the Saidian (Edward Said) dictum that “nothing disfigures the intellectuals’ public performance as much trimming, careful silence, patriotic bluster, and retrospective of self-dramatising prophecy.”

The story in Pakistan runs on different lines. Starting with I.H. Qureshi and Aziz Ahmad, scholars in our neighbours have tenaciously adhered to the belief that the creation of the Muslim nation was the culmination of a ‘natural’ process.

They have pressed into service the ‘two-nation’ theory to define nationality in purely Islamic terms. In the process, they have turned a blind eye to the syncretic and composite trajectory of Indian society, which began with Mohammad Iqbal’s memorable lines Ae Aab-e-Rood-e-Ganga! Woh Din Hain Yaad Tujh Ko? Utra Tere Kinare Jab Karwan Humara [Oh, waters of the river Ganges! Do you remember those days? Those days when our caravan halted on your bank?].

The same poet talked of “Naya Shiwala”, a temple of peace and goodwill. Again, the same poet gave lessons of religious understanding and tolerance in yet another poet.





Sadly, these thoughts are hardly reflected in our textbooks. We don’t emphasise the virtue of living with diversity and sharing social and cultural inheritances. We don’t introduce our students to the vibrant legacy of Kabir, Guru Nanak, Akbar, and Dara Shikoh. Instead, we dwell on the imaginary kufr-o-imaan ki jung, on the destruction of temples and forcible conversions. Increasingly, young students are introduced to the Islamist or the Hindutva world views that have caused incalculable damage to State and civil society.





Saadat Hasan Manto described an existentialist reality – the separation of people living on both sides who had a long history of cultural and social contact – and the paradoxical character of borders being a metaphor of the ambiguities of nation-building. He offered, without saying so, a way of correcting the distortions inherent in state-centered national histories.

Ayesha Jalal is right in pointing out that as “old orthodoxies recede before the flood of fresh historical evidence and earlier certitudes are overturned by newly detected contradictions”, this is the time to heal “the multiple fractures which turned the promised dawn of freedom into a painful moment of separation”.





In the words of the poet Ali Sardar Jafri:

Tum aao gulshan-e-Lahore se chaman bardosh, Hum Aayein subh-e-Benaras ki roshni le kar, Himalaya ke hawaaon ki taazigi le kar, aur uss ke baad yeh poochein ke kaun dushaman hai? .. [You come forward with flowers from the Garden of Lahore, We bring to you the light and radiance of the morning of Benaras, The freshness of the winds of Himalayas, And then we ask who the enemy is?].

Wars with India

The most blatant lies in Pakistani history textbooks are about the events that are still in our living memory. Among the many examples, the three given below are about the wars of 1965 and 1971, and the partition carnage of 1947. The reason for the falsehood lies in our distorted view of nationalism. Rather than letting children learn from our historical mistakes, we show them a false picture. Thus we are doomed to repeat these mistakes generation after generation.





The following excerpt regarding the 1965 war is taken from fifth grade reading material published by the NWFP Textbook Board, Peshawar in 2002 — “The Pakistan Army conquered several areas of India, and when India was at the verge of being defeated she ran to the United Nations to beg for a cease-fire. Magnanimously, thereafter, Pakistan returned all the conquered territories to India.”

The Punjab Textbook Board published the following text on the causes for the separation of East Pakistan in 1993 for secondary classes — “There were a large number of Hindus in East Pakistan. They had never truly accepted Pakistan. A large number of them were teachers in schools and colleges.

They continued creating a negative impression among students. No importance was attached to explaining the ideology of Pakistan to the younger generation.

The Hindus sent a substantial part of their earnings to Bharat, thus adversely affecting the economy of the province. Some political leaders encouraged provincialism for selfish gains. They went around depicting the central Government and (the then) West Pakistan as enemy and exploiter. Political aims were thus achieved at the cost of national unity.”





“While the Muslims provided all sorts of help to those non-Muslims desiring to leave Pakistan [during partition], people of India committed atrocities against Muslims trying to migrate to Pakistan. They would attack the buses, trucks and trains carrying the Muslim refugees and murder and loot them.” The latter excerpt was taken from an intermediate classes textbook — Civics of Pakistan, 2000.

Some more examples of totally contorted and misleading, yet ingenious and amusing, narrations of the history of Pakistan can be extracted from a single text, A Textbook of Pakistan Studies by M. D. Zafar.





“Pakistan came to be established for the first time when the Arabs led by Muhammad bin Qasim occupied Sindh and Multan. Pakistan under the Arabs comprised the Lower Indus Valley.”

“During the 11th century the Ghaznavid Empire comprised what is now Pakistan and Afghanistan. During the 12th century the Ghaznavids lost Afghanistan and their rule came to be confined to Pakistan”.





“By the 13th century Pakistan had spread to include the whole of Northern India and Bengal. Under the Khiljis Pakistan moved further South to include a greater part of Central India and the Deccan”.

“During the 16th century, ‘Hindustan’ disappeared and was completely absorbed in ‘Pakistan”.

“Shah Waliullah appealed to Ahmad Shah Durrani of Afghanistan and ‘Pakistan’ to come to the rescue of the Muslims of Mughal India, and save them from the tyrannies of the Marhattas…”

“In the Pakistan territories where a Sikh state had come to be established, the Muslims were denied freedom of religion.”

“Thus by the middle of the 19th century both Pakistan and Hindustan ceased to exist; instead British India came into being. Although Pakistan was created in August 1947, yet except for its name, the present-day Pakistan has existed, as a more or less single entity for centuries.”

Pakistan was made for Muslims

Dawn newspaper announces the death of Muhammad Ali Jinnah., on September 12, 1948.

The most blatant lie that covers page after page of history textbooks is that Pakistan was created for the promotion and propagation of religion. In fact, when the Muslim League was established in Dhaka in 1906, one of the foremost principles was the creation of loyalty to the British rulers and to promote greater understanding between Muslims and the British government.

The idea of religion barely entered the discourse of the Muslim League until the elections of 1937, when the League lost elections and the Congress won decisively. It was at that time that religious nationalism was invoked vigorously to create a feeling of unity among the Muslims of Uttar Pardesh (UP), Bengal and Punjab in order to provide the League an ideational basis of support. ↵



↵ Pakistan was mainly created for the protection and promotion of the class interests of the landed aristocracy which formed the League. The meeting at which the League was formed was attended mainly by the landed elite which feared that if the British left India and representative government was established, the traditional power of the loyal Muslim aristocracy would erode, especially since the class composition of the Congress reflected the educated urban and rural middle classes seeking upward mobility and a share in political power.

The peasant movement in Bengal was mobilised for purely political purposes since its aims and ideology conflicted radically with those of the landed aristocracy.





The urban educated middle classes of UP which joined the League later and enunciated the Hindu-Muslim difference argument in 1940, eschewed Muslim nationalism soon after independence because it had outlived its political use. The nature of the state outlined by the educated urban class in 1947 was based on a pluralistic vision of a state based on religious and citizenship equality.

According to the flood report by Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), eight people have lost their lives in Goalpara district since on Thursday. Kamrup Metro district, which primarily comprise Guwahati city, has witnessed five deaths in the same period. Of these, four deaths have been reported due to landslide and one on account of electrocution, it added.

Two persons died and one more is missing in Boko area of Kamrup Rural district. Also, a child was killed in landslide in Dhubri district's Hatsingimari area.

Authorities have opened 94 relief camps and shelter homes where nearly 85,000 people have been shifted with the Goalpara district becoming the worst-hit in the latest round of floods due to heavy rains in Assam and Meghalaya since Saturday.

The report said 3.7 lakh people are affected in 10 districts. Nearly 1.5 lakh people are hit in Kamrup Rural, while over 1.4 lakh persons are suffering in Goalpara.

Altogether, 12 districts are affected in the flood with 415 villages and nearly 9,000 hectares of crop area are under water, it added.

The affected districts are Goalpara, Kamrup Metro, Kamrup Rural, Dhemaji, Barpeta, Udalguri, Bongaigaon, Kokrajhar, Nalbari, Morigaon, Sonitpur, Darrang and Lakhimpur.

A number of embankments have been breached across the state. In Nalbari, four breaches have been reported in Mora Pagladia, while two cuts are seen in Nonoi river in Darrang.

In Sonitpur, rain gobbled different parts of Brahmaputra dyke, while embankments got breached along Belsiri and Jiabhoroli rivers.

Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi held an emergency meeting with senior officials during the day to take stock of the situation and directed the authorities concerned to take all-out measures to deal with it, CMO officials said.

Medicines have been dispatched to the flood-hit areas.

Besides, water purifiers, hand pumps, mobile water treatment plants and pumping equipment have also been sent, a disaster management department official said.

In the worst-hit Goalpara, over 80,000 people are living in 84 shelter places.

Goalpara Deputy Commissioner Preetom Saikia said a bridge over Krishnai on NH-37 was damaged and a team of engineers has been sent to restore it.

With rains letting up, rescue and relief operation are on and Air Force choppers have been pressed into service to rescue marooned people in Dudhnoi, Krishnai and Bolbola.

The state government has called in the Army, which along with NDRF and SDRF teams, have been engaged for rescue work.

""However, majority of the people have come down on their own,"" Saikia said.

The flood situation in Kamrup Rural district turned grim with bodies of two women recovered from a paddy field in Boko area, police said.

The report was submitted to the state government, Ministry of Home Affairs and National Disaster Management Authority.

The report had suggested that the storm water drains had to be cleared for flood waters to flow freely.

Since then, the government has not moved an inch to restore the storm water drain network in the city because of which flooding has become a common phenomenon. The monsoon preparedness of city agencies was once again exposed last week when the city received over 100 mm rainfall in just 48 hours.

The researchers, who worked on the case study of Bengaluru flooding, are upset. They feel that the government agencies do not take the research papers seriously. “So far, only two engineers from the BBMP came to us discussing about the strategies for mitigating urban floods. After that nothing happened on the report, which also lists the reasons and practical solutions to bring down flooding. Removal of encroachments on storm water drains and not allowing fresh encroachments were the major recommendations made, but not followed by the government. The authorities still allowed change in land use and several storm water drains are today buried under apartment complexes,” said Dr T.V. Ramachandra from the Energy and Wetland Research Group, IISc.

He said that the lakes in the city were interlinked once, and the excess water flowed from one tank to another ensuring that the city was not flooded. “But unplanned urbanisation and encroachments on the waterways have drastically altered the drainage characteristics of natural catchments in Bengaluru. This has also increased the volume and rate of surface runoff. Drainage systems are unable to cope with the increased volume of water and are often encountered with the blockage due to indiscriminate disposal of solid waste.

The devastation in Uttarakhand had already happened much before the cataclysmic events of June 2013. The unprecedented rainfall and floods and loss of life drew attention to the alarming situation in a State known for its pristine forests and rivers. It also drew attention belatedly to the “bumper to bumper” dams in the mountains.

Construction on all >dams in Uttarakhand was halted by the Supreme Court in August 2013 and on its instructions, the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) appointed an expert body which said that 23 hydropower projects out of the 24 it was asked to examine would have an irreversible impact on the biodiversity of the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi basins and should not be constructed.

In May, the Supreme Court reiterated its orders stopping work on the 24 hydropower projects examined by the body. While all this amounts to shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, it is a measure of recognition of the man-made destruction wrought by unplanned hydel power projects in a sensitive and fragile ecosystem.

Endangering the Ganga The body’s report said, “The problem with the dams is their location in a high or very high biodiversity value area, some of them at elevations above 2,200-2,500 metres. These altitudes come in the paraglacial and glacial zones and in these zones, the rivers are capable of mobilizing tremendous amounts of sediments, under intense rainfall conditions, from the moraine left behind in the past by receding glaciers. In such situations, they cause havoc in the vicinity of dams as witnessed at the Vishnuprayag barrage site and below during the June 2013 disaster.”

The State of Uttarakhand is a part of the Ganga basin and rivers suffer from several depradations apart from >dams in high places , including extensive pollution from untreated sewage. Despite huge amounts of money being spent, plans to clean up the river have failed miserably. An IIT-led consortium has been set up to prepare a master plan for the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA), to restore its “wholesomeness,” as the extended summary of a draft Ganga River Basin Management plan says. Citing anthropogenic activities, it says dams and barrages have snapped her “longitudinal connectivity.”

While the recent Ganga Manthan event in Delhi attracted more than its fair share of sadhus, there were a few who spoke against dams and said that they were a threat to the river’s existence. But the focus was on keeping the river Ganga “ aviral and nirmal ” (continuous and unpolluted flow). Activists said only cleaning up the river will not restore it. Some pointed to the lack of studies of the entire river system and hydrological data which was a secret. Since the Ganga is glacier fed, the climate change impact in the Himalayan ecosystem and on the receding Gangotri and other glaciers are also of paramount importance.

In its report of March 2013, the Inter-Ministerial Group (IMG) on Issues Relating to River Ganga says that the development of new hydro power projects has an impact on the environment, the ecology, the biodiversity, both terrestrial and aquatic, and economic and social life. Crucially, it says that in the upper reaches of the river — where the oxygenating abilities of the river are the highest — there are growing signs of contamination. This suggests that even here, water withdrawal for hydroelectricity is endangering the health of the Ganga. Implementation of the 69 hydro power projects will lead to 81 per cent of the Bhagirathi and 65 per cent of the Alaknanda getting affected. The IMG had considered the need to have portions of the river free of hydro projects and recommended that six rivers should be kept in pristine form.

Cumulative impact In the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi basins, the report said that 17 dams have been commissioned with a total installed capacity of 1,851 MW. Fourteen projects of 2,538 MW capacity are in different stages of construction and 39 projects with an installed capacity of 4,644 MW are in different stages of planning. The expert body report said that if all the 450 dams in the State are completed, about 252 projects will each have an installed capacity of 5MW or more. The vast majority of them will divert rivers through tunnels to power houses downstream. Their combined impact will affect the >landscape of Uttarakhand . The environment management plans of individual projects do not address the cumulative impacts of multiple projects in a river valley.

With dams proposed on major rivers for every 20 to 25 kilometre stretch, large fragments of these rivers could be left with minimal flow as almost all the river water is extracted for producing hydroelectricity, the body’s report has said. Prof. Ravi Chopra, chairperson of the body said that tunnelling is also controversial and leads to damage with natural springs being diverted and homes developing cracks. The government has only looked at the need to generate power and not the impact on the environment. On field visits, the body noticed scarred landscapes, dry river beds and a complete disappearance of riverine ecosystems due to submergence at existing and under construction large hydropower projects such as Tehri Stage I and Koteshwar on the Bhagirathi basin and the Srinagar dam in the Alaknanda basin.

Deforestation If all the dams are built, studies indicate a loss of biodiversity. A National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) report, quoted by the body, has highlighted the effect of the Tehri dam on the unique self-purifying ability of Gangajal. It attributed this property to river sediments; data indicated that the blocking of sediments behind the Tehri dam diminished this property.

Extensive deforestation and diversion of forest land too has posed problems. The body found that 80,826.91 hectares of forests have been diverted for non-forest use in Uttarakhand since 1980. The diversion for hydropower production is 5,312.11 ha. Most of the diversion for roads and hydropower has been in Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Pithoragarh districts, the areas most affected in the June 2013 disaster.

Hearings People have been agitating against dams for years in the region, notably Tehri. In 2010-11, and for the first time for any project, there were three public hearings on the Devsari hydel project on the Pinder. After two hearings, the third one was accepted by the government, according to Vimalbhai of the Matu Jansangthan which led protests along with the Bhu-Swami Sangharsh Samiti. He says this was the first major protest after the ones against Tehri. A public hearing was also organised where many voiced their opposition to the dams and on the need to keep the undammed tributary of the Ganga that way. He referred to the pathetic status of the catchment area, and the lack of studies on water flows and climate change impacts. The people displaced by the Tehri dam are still to get land rights or basic amenities in their relocated homes, he added.

Local people who have borne the brunt of the >devastation due to dams and floods and environmental groups have questioned the feasibility of dams. By all accounts there is cause for concern as reflected in many reports. Even as the Uttarakhand government proposes to approach the Supreme Court in a bid to get a green signal for dam construction, it must remember this. It has to ensure that the quest for hydropower cannot come without a responsibility to preserve a region that is limping back to life after a calamity aggravated by unplanned human interventions neither scientifically assessed nor endorsed by the people of the region.

Cauvery delta region, considered to be the granary of Tamil Nadu, is prone to many natural calamities like uncertain monsoon rains, periodical floods etc.

Under these circumstances, a new rice variety named “Sigappi” has been developed by researchers at Annamalai University to get better yields under submerged conditions. It is 150-154 days under irrigated condition and is ideally suited for samba (khariff) season in Tamil Nadu.

“With the North East Monsoon affecting the livelihoods of small and medium farmers of Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Thanjavur districts, this semi dwarf, erect, and non–lodging variety gives higher productivity of 3.4 tonnes per hectare even if fields get submerged in water during monsoon for 10-12 days continuously,” says Dr.RM. Kathiresan, Professor, Department of Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture, Annamalai University.

Being similar to the traditional popular variety called Ponmani, released nearly a decade back, the Sigappi variety has white coloured short and bold grains, is best suited for making idli and dosa and fetches a good price.

It is also found to be resistant to leaf folder, stem borer and moderately susceptible to green leaf hopper, brown spot, rice Tungro disease and rice blast, according to him.

“The main reason for developing an alternative variety to Ponmani for Samba season was a long felt need among delta farmers.

In these regions the choice among rice varieties with fine grains that suit the requirement for lunch purposes are comparatively more than the options for rice varieties that suit tiffin purposes (idly and dosa making) with bold grains and better dough making quality, and Sigappi variety suited well,” explains Dr. Kathiresan.

A kg of this paddy is priced at Rs.20 to 23 and Rs.30 to 32 as rice today in local market. When sold for seed purpose, it fetches a price of Rs.35 to 40 per kg.

Though most of the rice varieties generally withstand partial submergence for prolonged duration, complete submergence is intolerable for more than a day or two.

It also gives a straw yield of six tonnes per hectare, on an average, and the straw remains unaffected even after ten days of complete submergence under water.

The package of practices for cultivation is again similar to any long duration samba variety, with a seed rate of 30 kg / hectare, spacing. The rice was distributed free of cost to farmers in delta regions under different schemes implemented by the University. This has resulted in farmers exchanging the seeds among themselves thereby increasing the area under its cultivation.

The International Rice Research Institute recorded its appreciation to the University for the release of this new variety.

It could also be a suitable variety for consideration under new seed subsidy scheme, if released by State Variety Release Committee. “Sigappi would certainly serve the best interest of Cauvery delta farmers as it protects their livelihood and economic interests at times of natural calamities,” says Dr. Kathiresan.

Especially, in villages like Keelathirukallipalai of tsunami affected parangipettai block this variety has made a significant farm impact.

Previously, local varieties grown there it did not produce better yield, after the tsunami so many switched over to this variety and they observed this variety to be better. From an acre the farmers have been able to harvest 2 tonnes under normal conditions. In case of flash floods they can get 1.2 to 1.5 tonnes of grain from an acre, whereas from other varieties, less than one tonne alone could be expected.

In Thalaignayiru and Vattakudi villages of Vedaranyam in Nagapattinam district, the Sigappi variety is being tried under direct sowing conditions. It is also a perfect choice for integrated rice farming designs such as paddy, fish and poultry integration.

For the ensuing season free seeds have been distributed to more than 100 farmers and nearly 150 farmers are cultivating it.

It is also suitable for growing in other parts of the country which are prone to flooding during monsoon, according to Dr. Kathiresan.

Retired civil servant and chairman of Centre for Policy Research K.C. Siva Ramakrishnan will be the chairman of the committee. The other members are Rathin Roy, director of National Institute of Public Finance and Policy; Aromar Revi, director of Indian Institute for Human Settlements; Jagan Shah, director of National Institute of Urban Affairs; and K.T. Ravindran, former dean of School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi.

The committee will have to consult the Union government and both the new state governments before submitting its recommendations by 31 August, the Union ministry of home affairs said in a statement.

Comprising 13 districts spread across two regions, coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema, the new state will have to build its capital after Andhra Pradesh’s capital Hyderabad is transferred to Telangana.

Hyderabad will be the joint capital of the two states for a 10-year period until Seemandhra builds its capital, according to legislation passed by Parliament. Telangana will officially be the country’s 29th state from 2 June.

The committee will have to evaluate various locations in the state and make its recommendations on the basis of land availability, access to water and other essential natural resources “with due regard to the possibility of de-reservation of degraded forest land,"" according to the terms of reference laid out by the home ministry.

The new capital will become a contentious issue among the different districts of the state, said E. Venkatesu, political science professor at University of Hyderabad. The possible contenders are Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada-Guntur belt, Donakonda in Prakasam district, and Tirupati. Organisations in different districts have already begun lobbying for the new capital.

The potential capital should have adequate land to house the state secretariat, state legislature (assembly and council), Raj Bhavan, a high court, government offices, guest houses, residential quarters and other physical infrastructure such as conference halls, stadiums, convention centres, markets, hospitals, educational institutes, hotels and other places of recreation.

At the same time, the committee should consider a location that entails minimum cost of land acquisition and construction, besides ascertaining the availability of raw materials, skilled and unskilled labour to construct the new capital. The new location should also not be vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods, cyclones and earthquakes.

The new capital should ensure minimum resettlement of people and dislocation of agriculture systems, and not cause any harm to local ecology and water bodies.

The new capital should be well connected by rail, road and air to not just the 13 districts of the new Andhra Pradesh state, but also Hyderabad and other important cities in the region. The committee will also have to examine the possibility of developing rapid mass transit systems within the new capital city.

The committee will accept suggestions (feedback.expcomt@mha.gov.in) from the general public till 7 May.

490,2639,hyderabad,2014,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/cleaning-the-ganga-step-by-step/article6105068.ece,12 Jun 2014,"Cleaning the Ganga, step by step","June 12, 2014 01:59 am | Updated 01:59 am IST

Traversing over 2,500 km, from the Gangotri glacier in the Himalayas to the Sunderbans delta in Bangladesh, the Ganga is used by hundreds of millions of people. This is one of the few river basins in India that is rich in water resources but highly polluted. How did one of the world’s mightiest rivers end up as a garbage dump?

Issues affecting the river are myriad and complex. Untreated sewage and industrial waste are dumped into the waters without remorse. Reduced flow and rampant underground water withdrawals affect millions of people who depend on the river’s water. Further, floods and droughts, which endanger lives and cause serious damage to crops, livestock and infrastructure, are a common phenomenon in the river basin. A changing climate will pose more challenges. The combination of glacial retreat, decreasing ice mass, early snowmelt and increased winter stream flow will add to the pressure. There is now clear evidence that climate change is already affecting the Himalayan ice cover. This will have a profound impact on the river.

However, all is not lost yet. Recent initiatives by the Indian government such as including ‘River Development’ and ‘Ganga Rejuvenation’ to the portfolio of the Minister of Water Resources, and the establishment of the National Ganga River Basin Authority and the National Mission for Clean Ganga, show a commitment to address some of these pressing concerns with special attention given to pollution control.

Even though the task of cleaning the Ganga is a daunting one, significant strides can be made toward achieving this.

The Ganges is a complex transboundary basin which flows across different jurisdictions. Therefore, a basin-scale approach would help manage the water resources better. This would require close coordination with all the countries sharing the Ganga, such as Nepal and Bangladesh, so that the interests of both upstream and downstream users are taken into consideration. The existing treaties on “sharing water resources” could be renegotiated as “shared management of water resources.”

Second, the Ganga is highly polluted. Yet, of the 400 million people living along the banks of the river, many still rely on its natural systems for their livelihoods. According to a World Bank report, a number of government efforts (Ganga Action Plan: Phases I and II) have attempted to address the pollution problem, but the results have been disappointing so far. It is estimated that sewage constitutes the largest portion (80 per cent) of the pollution load followed by pollution caused by industrial discharge agricultural activities. With agricultural activities intensifying in areas near the river, particularly in urban and peri-urban areas, farmers frequently rely on waste water for irrigation. This poses a serious public health risk. However, this adversity can be turned into an opportunity as urban waste offers a significant nutrient resource for farming, if safely treated and applied. Low cost, simple ecological sanitation and reuse systems will be keys to making waste water treatment feasible for agricultural purposes.

Third, environmental flows are essentially the water requirements of aquatic ecosystems and of basic human, social and spiritual needs. However, the concept of environmental flow only refers to the the quantity of water required to maintain river ecology under different environmental conditions. Deteriorating water quality in the Ganga — due to domestic, industrial and agricultural effluents — is also a major threat to riverine ecosystems and to people whose livelihoods depend on water. Innovative methods for maintaining environmental flows and the quality of water during environmentally critical periods, along with procedures for implementing these methods, need to be investigated.

In cities, towns and industrial estates most vulnerable to flooding in the Ganges river basin, major investments are required to address climate variability. Existing flood forecasts are often too technical and not easy for the public to understand. Application of remote sensing and hydrological modelling has helped in developing high-quality flood maps, which are useful for developing plans for river conservation, maintaining the quality of water in different stretches and, more importantly, reducing the vulnerabilities of the affected communities.

Innovative approaches such as underground taming of floods for irrigation and aquifer management could offer solutions to the flood problem. These approaches essentially involve storing floodwaters in underground structures in upstream areas. This will help prevent floods and help maintain water availability even during dry seasons.

In addition to the steps taken by the government to clean the Ganga, successful implementation of this task would require partnerships with various stakeholders. Multiple agencies working to address the problem could be brought on board. The private sector has also shown its willingness to be a partner in cleaning the river, especially at critical points such as Varanasi. Similarly, the public at large, along with civil society groups, also need to be actively engaged in these efforts.

In recent times, the clamour for a cleaner Ganga has gained momentum. Although huge progress is being made, the need of the hour is to widen our focus. Negotiations on economic revitalisation of the Ganga should involve India, Nepal and Bangladesh. This task in itself is of mammoth proportions. However, by taking small steps, we can still reduce the pollution load and restore the river to the people.

The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Monday sent governments a final draft of its synthesis report, which combines three earlier, gigantic documents by the Nobel Prize-winning group. There is little in the report that wasn't in the other more-detailed versions, but the language is more stark and the report attempts to connect the different scientific disciplines studying problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas.

The 127-page draft, obtained by The Associated Press, paints a harsh warning of what's causing global warming and what it will do to humans and the environment. It also describes what can be done about it.

""Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems,"" the report says. The final report will be issued after governments and scientists go over the draft line by line in an October conference in Copenhagen.

Depending on circumstances and values, ""currently observed impacts might already be considered dangerous,"" the report says. It mentions extreme weather and rising sea levels, such as heat waves, flooding and droughts. It even raises, as an earlier report did, the idea that climate change will worsen violent conflicts and refugee problems and could hinder efforts to grow more food. And ocean acidification, which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans, will harm marine life, it says.

Risks high or very high by end of century

Without changes in greenhouse gas emissions, ""climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century,"" the report says.

In 2009, countries across the globe set a goal of limiting global warming to about another degree Celsius above current levels. But the report says that it is looking more likely that the world will shoot past that point. Limiting warming to that much is possible but would require dramatic and immediate cuts in carbon dioxide pollution.

The report says if the world continues to spew greenhouse gases at its accelerating rate, it's likely that by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another two degrees compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005. And by the end of the century, that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 3.7 degrees warmer.

""The report tells us once again what we know with a greater degree of certainty: that climate change is real, it is caused by us, and it is already causing substantial damage to us and our environment,"" Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann wrote in an email. ""If there is one take home point of this report it is this: We have to act now.""

John Christy of the University of Alabama, Huntsville, is in the tiny minority of scientists who are skeptical of mainstream science's claim that global warming is a major problem. He says people will do OK: ""Humans are clever. We shall adapt to whatever happens.""

While projections show that the world will warm and climate will change, there's still a level of uncertainty about how much, and that makes the problem all about how much risk we accept, said MIT climate scientist Kerry Emanuel.

If it's soon and only a little risk, he said, that's not too bad, but when you look at the risk curve the other end of it is ""very frightening.""

As the water level in some of the worst-affected areas of the city continue to recede, many people were seen trying their best to salvage whatever is left in their house.

With water still dripping from the photo album, Sumeet while showing a picture of her house says, ""Now only memories remain of what once used to be our abode. The floods have taken away everything we had. This house too has now become unsafe to live in.""

Tightly packed in two layers of polythene and locked in a wardrobe, the photo album of Sumeet's wedding was the only item in her house that survived the fury of the devastating floods of September 7.

Having seen the worst days of militancy in Kashmir, Sumeet's is one amongst a handful of Kashmiri Pandit families who decided against migration and stayed back in Kashmir when the armed insurgency started in late '80s.

""We never saw such a huge tragedy, my family is witness to some of the worst days in the Valley, but a tragedy of such a huge magnitude was unprecedented,"" she says, ""Having lost everything, our lives will never be the same again.""

Sumeet's husband Rajesh, who owned an electronic shop in Lal Chowk, the once bustling commercial hub of Srinagar, says that his entire business was ruined by the flood water as all the goods in his shop were destroyed.

""Nothing could be saved, we only saved our lives. After being trapped in the house and struggling for four days without food and water the locals saved us and now for the past 13 days we have been living in a Gurudwara at Barzulla Bagat,"" Rajesh said.

Even as water continued to recede, several localities in Srinagar including Raj Bagh, Jawahar Nagar are still under several feet of water. Floating animal carcasses and other debris have made it

difficult for the residents to reach their houses. Stagnated water has also increased the threat of various waterborne diseases.

""This heap of rubble is what once used to be my three- storey house. My three kids were born in this house so were the kids of my brothers. I have spent my childhood in this house and my parents breathed their last in this house,"" said Amarjeet Singh, a resident of Jawahar Nagar.

""The structure can be rebuilt, but what about the memories that were associated with the house. Physical scars can heal but the scars on our memories will never heal,"" he said.

As per the government figures more than two lakh structures were damaged, which included 20,000 completely destroyed houses, in the floods that hit the Kashmir Valley earlier this month.

""Approximately 2,34,516 structures have been damaged, which includes nearly 20,000 completely damaged houses, in the valley excluding district Srinagar.

493,2642,hyderabad,2014,https://www.dawn.com/news/1129428,3 Sept 2014,Migration seen through the prism of climate change,"Halting climate change is impossible.

Sounding alarm bells of almost apocalyptic magnitude, scientists and climatologists are saying that it would impact natural resources directly, making some parts of the world virtually uninhabitable. This, inevitably, would result in mass movement of human tide.

Norwegian minister of foreign affairs, Jonas Gahr Støre affirmed that back in 2011 at the Nansen Conference on Climate Change and Displacement:

“Human displacement due to climate change is happening now. There is no need to debate it.”

The realisation, somehow, has not hit authorities in Pakistan, who remain in a state of denial. This, despite the reality of having witnessed a movement (albeit a slow one) of people from rural to urban centres, due in part to climate-related events which have been taking place over the last several decades.

Since the 1970s, the towns of Thatta and Badin, on the Indus coastal belt, have seen families migrating (an estimated 40,000 people) due to water shortages, seawater intrusion (which has rendered up to 1.2 million acres of land infertile), and extreme events like the cyclones of 1999 and 2005) to the neighbouring port city of Karachi.

Climate change may be a scientific fact, and difficult to grasp, but it is already being increasingly felt by humans.

Naseer Memon, head of the non-profit institution Strengthening Participatory Organization (SPO) told Dawn.com:

""Unfortunately neither the policy nor the government acknowledges that climate change has any direct link with migration. The government has other priorities and climate change does not feature on its list.""

Haris Gazdar, a senior researcher at Karachi-based Collective for Social Science Research, emphasised that ""all policies and programmes addressing climate change should include migration analysis as a component"".

The Global Climate Risk Index 2014, which analyses the extent to which countries have been affected by the impact of weather-related events (storms, floods, heat waves); states that Pakistan, Haiti and the Philippines were most affected in 2012.

Thus the recent paper ""Climate Change and Migration Exploring the linkage and what needs to be done in the context of Pakistan"" [*a priced publication] by Leadership for Environment and Development (LEAD), provides much food for thought and an opportunity to look at climate change through the prism of migration and vice versa.

The paper asserts that the consequences of climate change are likely to influence population movements significantly in the future.

At another level, the paper provides a forum to open conversation between scientific community, humanitarian workers and policy makers to fine tune and review old policies and put in place operational mechanisms to manage inevitable climate-induced displacement.

But before plunging into taking action, the response has to be guided by relevant knowledge. Therefore, the paper calls for a population census (late by almost 25 years) that takes into account environmental factors; a national migration policy and to mainstream migration-related concerns into the overarching development and climate change policy.

Oxfam's 2013 study on the Indus delta migration had, among other points, also recommended a migration policy to cover both internal and external migration. It called for studying the existing patterns and potential routes and destinations of migration in years to come; and to expand the definition of in-migration to include population movements within the same districts in the national census.

However, Adnan Sattar, the author of the LEAD paper has consistently argued that climate change-related migration cannot be seen in isolation from ""other forms of migration"" including, say, labour migration or environmental migration.

He also stressed that when talking about the various movements, it was important to take ""a more humane or human-centered approach.""

Talking to Dawn.com, Sattar said: ""What we need is a comprehensive migration policy that covers both internal and international migration; and frames migration as an adaptation strategy in the face of new challenges, including the challenge of climate change.""

He also added that policy has to be underpinned by a ""strong normative commitment to human rights, equity and non-discrimination.""

If Gazdar were asked by the government to help form a policy, he said he would add a number of ""cross-cutting themes such as poverty, vulnerability, gender, public goods, social protection, and of course, migration.""

Old laws, new mobility

The paper takes a look at various international laws covering migration to see if climate change figures specifically in them and finds ""increasingly restrictive immigration regimes for migrants from developing world most affected by the impact of climate change"".

Even Pakistan's Climate Change Policy, released in 2013, is silent on the possibilities of climate-related migration, the shape it may take or the areas it is likely to happen. It fails to look at ways to facilitate planned migration or reduce forced migration.

According to Sattar, the 1998 United Nations Guiding Principles of Internal Displacement should not only be a source of continued reference, but that Pakistan should implement them through appropriate laws, policies and institutions.

Sattar said successive governments in Pakistan have either adopted a ""hands-off"" approach towards migration or, in the case of external migration, seen it exclusively as an ""economic opportunity to raise remittances"".

Putting climate change-related migration a political challenge

Today, many think that prevention of displacement and management of climate induced risk should be put on political agenda as solutions lie therein.

There's a huge list of questions that need to be addressed — and addressed soon, based on the kind of migration (short term and short distance); and measures required around which the policy can be formulated.

How cities plan on absorbing a burgeoning migrant population; would the displaced be provided basic employment rights and social support mechanisms that established residents enjoy. Even the toll the influx will have on urban planning, infrastructure etc will require political solutions.

""A nuanced understanding of the migration story in Pakistan makes it abundantly clear that political economy plays a key role in the patterns of population movement,"" said Sattar.

Giving examples of large-scale migration of labourers from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the north and Southern Punjab to the industrial hub of Karachi; he blamed skewed development policies for favouring commercial agriculture and industrialisation.

""Much of ethno-nationalist politics in Sindh, for example, is intimately tied up with successive waves of migration into the province's urban center. In the coming years and decades, denial of the reality of climate change, including its manifestation in the form of greater frequency of extreme events, could spell disaster for the country. Some of the policy changes required to address the climate change challenge may strike at the heart of political and economic interests of Pakistan's political elite.

""We may need to phase out certain water-intensive crops, for example. Such proposals will not go down well with the all-powerful owners of sugar industry in Pakistan. So, it's not just an issue of awareness but competing economic interests as well.""

He acknowledged that while solutions may not be easy to implement, he hoped the more progressive political actors realised that marginalised groups are likely to suffer most as the consequences of climate change.

Migration — no silver bullet to adaptation

The paper also looks at two aspects of climate change-related migration.

One relates to local adaptation, which reduces the need for migration and particularly stress migration; while the other talks about migration as a planned adaptation response to consequences of climate change.

As climate change increases, local knowledge becomes increasingly outdated (knowing when to sow, harvest) and needs to be propped up by modern and scientific tools.

At the same time, improvement in weather forecasting may not be enough; communities need to know how to use this information. Early warning systems need to be invested in, but they require modern equipment as well as people who are trained to read and decipher that information. Based on past experience, the building codes are flouted and land-use plans not enforced.

The paper points out the need to strengthen the capacities of National Disaster Management Authorities and its provincial and district counterparts.

""Adaptation should make people resilient enough to cope with climate change impacts and co-exist rather than migrate,"" according to Memon. He said that if government and local initiatives were ""smart"" enough, adaptation would strengthen and enable people manage the challenges instead of migrating.

Moving is not easy. The report argues that often a time, climate change even prevents people from moving, as migration requires resources and people have become poorer due to impact on livelihood from climate change.","

(Seychelles News Agency) - A decade after the 2004 tsunami, Seychelles will be joining other countries in the Indian Ocean basin to participate in the Indian Ocean Wave Exercise or IOWAVE14 to mark the tenth anniversary since the disaster.

This was decided recently during the 9th session of the Intergovernmental Coordination Group for the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System, which was held in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Planned for next month, the exercise will involve a tsunamis alert which will be given following a simulated earthquake firstly in Java, Indonesia. A second alert will be raised the second day, this time with a ‘simulated’ earthquake that will occur in the Makran Trench, south of Iran and Pakistan.

The Indian Ocean countries involved were able to review the planned exercise during an intercessional meeting held in Hyderabad, India, earlier this year.

According to the Information and Communication Officer in the Division for Risk and Disaster Management, DRDM, Regina Prosper, Seychelles is expecting to play an important role in this event as it will mark the tenth anniversary of the first major tsunamis event experienced by the Indian Ocean archipelago.

“All the agencies and partners will use this exercise in order to test their standard operating procedures which have been designed for response within and between organisations. A specific area or areas will be chosen for the exercise and we will use our alert systems and equipment and we hope that each partners will be able to coordinate their own evacuation plans using designated routes and assembly point or shelters,” Prosper told SNA.

Surely no one has forgotten when almost all of the granitic islands in the archipelago felt the aftermath of the earthquake which struck the Aceh Province in Indonesia on December 26, 2004. A tsunami that followed reached the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean, including Seychelles.

Some 230,000 people from around 14 countries were killed in the disaster.

Seychelles lost 3 of its citizens in the tsunami which left many people in distress for several days as bridges and roads were severely damaged, homes and infrastructures along the coastal areas were flooded and an important record of properties were sucked out to sea by the waves.

In spite of being considered one of the safest countries in the Indian Ocean due to its geographical position and geology, Seychelles, has had its share of disasters that have highlighted the need for prevention and preparative measures.

The worst disaster dates back to 1862 precisely on October 12, when torrential rain caused a landslide which saw raging floods of mud and swirling waters cover a large area of the Seychelles capital of Victoria destroying houses, roads and bridges as well as costing the lives of at least 25 men, 27 women and 23 children according to archive records.

While such disastrous event of that magnitude has not reoccurred in recent years the Indian Ocean island nation has experienced minor disasters.

Severe flooding and landslides are often felt in low lying areas during periods of heavy rainfall as was the case in January this year.

Disaster preparedness - A national business

Created in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami, the Division for Risk and Disaster Management, DRDM, an independent entity which falls under the Ministry of Environment and Energy has as its prime functions the four phases of the Disaster Management Continuum which are preparedness, prevention, response and recovery.

Prosper noted that Seychelles has come a long way in taking disaster prevention and preparation measures.

“Most of our key partners such as Red Cross, Fire and Rescue services, etc have a well-designed plan for such scenarios and their staff have received relevant training over the past ten years,” she said while not stopping short of admitting that much still needs to be done in order to achieve 100 percent emergency preparedness and management in the country.

The division is therefore working closely with the most vulnerable groups in the community to be better prepared to respond to disasters which includes the public and private schools.

Most of the thirty six public and private schools in Seychelles have an average population of over five hundred students each and lack the human resources capacity to cater for disasters on a large scale.

Prosper said that in order to help them DRDM has initiated a national program for ‘Schools Emergency Preparedness and Management’.

“We have first introduced the programme to the management levels of the schools. We have also visited them and assess what they have in place and how best we could assist and support them.”

She added that currently regular visits are conducted at the various schools around the country.

“We want the schools and their staff to be committed to any emergency plans so that lives of children of Seychelles could be saved in any emergency situation and if there is tsunami for example.’

Drill exercises are conducted at school level at least three times a year. In addition some schools especially those located near the coastal areas, are also involved in national simulation exercises such as the Indian Ocean Wave simulation which will take place next month.

Following the tsunami simulation in September an evaluation exercise will be conducted locally and internationally to assess Seychelles’ and other Indian Ocean countries preparedness if ever they are faced with another tsunami.",discussion,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

, the diwan of Mysore, zeroed in on the same area that had been identified by Ibrahim Qutub Shah's engineers.

HYDERABAD: Legend has it that when the construction of the Hussainsagar was completed in the middle of the 17th century the lake had only little water. The reigning sultan Ibrahim Qutub Shah was furious and said come-what-may he would like to see an overflowing lake. Aides got on to the job and with the help of engineers identified the area around Gandipet, a village about 20 km from Hyderabad, from where water could be tapped and drawn to the Hussainsagar through a stream.The Gandipet lake was dug but somehow never put to use. The Hussainsagar water shortage was met by other easier means but the disused stream was visible in 1913 survey maps of Hyderabad.Vishveshwaraiah said that two dams-Osmansagar and Himayatsagar-should be built on the Musa Nadi and its tributary Isa Nadi to tackle the twin problem of flooding and providing drinking water to the city. The dams became operational in the 1920s. A 14 km conduit was constructed between the Osmansagar and the Asifnagar filter bed in the city to transport water through gravitational force. Hyderabad then had five lakh denizens.The city has grown since and its population now tops 80 lakhs. Not surprisingly the two beautiful water bodies have ceased to be the only source of drinking water to Hyderabad. Today they are on the verge of extinction. But the Osmansagar and Himayatsagar are more than just drinking water supplying sources. They are the pillars on which the eco-balance of the area rests. Therefore, concerned citizens woke up to the danger long time ago and launched efforts to protect the dams. But their attempts have been stonewalled.For Narasimha Reddy of Joint Action for Water, the future of the two dams is dark. He says that the construction of the Outer Ring Road has caused the biggest damage to the supply of water to the dams. ""The ORR has cut through the veins that connect to the hearts of the two water bodies. Numerous streams and nalas that supplied water to the reservoirs have been de-linked. Now either their water has been diverted in some other direction or allowed to make small ponds of their own.""The other problems that plague the area are illegal encroachments, stone quarrying establishments, oil units, etc. Besides, the GO 111 of 1996 did not foresee the construction boom that would be taking place in the area. It merely banned industrial units in 10 square km area and allowed construction of the residential units. The construction of an international airport in Shamshabad has dealt another severe blow to the existence of dams.Jeevanand Reddy, a scientist activist, points out that it is not just private players who violated rules and constructed commercial complexes, recreational facilities and resorts within the 10 sq km area. The government too constructed cluster of houses in Chilkur located just behind the Osmansagar.The springs in Anantgiri Hills from where Musa Nadi begins its journey and its route up to the Osmansagar have been disturbed. Apart from growth of villages and towns, agriculture and horticulture activity on the route have witnessed tremendous increase. This has led to marked decline in inflows in the reservoirs.Every passing year throws up more dried up land and boulders dotting the two lakes during summers. During monsoon and winter seasons there is some relief to the eyes, but not enough.Bad planning and management have put the Osmansagar and Himayatsagar that form the collective natural heritage of Hyderabad on the road to extinction. Will the government wake up to this reality?",issue,Hyderabad floods,"Hyderabad, India",1908,1920s,Hyderabad,,,,Two dams-Osmansagar and Himayatsagar-were built on the Musa Nadi and its tributary Isa Nadi to tackle the twin problem of flooding and providing drinking water to the city.

Misery and uncertainty continued to plague thousands of villagers rendered homeless in the interior areas of Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Pithoragarh even as teams of the Army, ITBP, NDRF and State police rescued over 10,000 pilgrims on Sunday. The remaining 7,000 odd pilgrims would be rescued soon, authorities hope.

The rescue operations were hampered by mild showers in places like Dehradun and Joshimath. The Met office has predicted more rains on Monday and Tuesday.

The Director General of Police has ordered all local police chiefs to escort pilgrims trekking their way out to avoid mishaps. Special security would be provided to women, he said.

Many pilgrims and residents wondered why the government had not made proper arrangements for the Char Dham Yatra even after 12 years of formation of Uttarakhand. Disasters due to cloudbursts, flash floods and landslides have been common but the authorities seemed content with small temporary measures after each disaster, said Renu D. Singh of the Samadhan Women Helpline.

Sarita and Neetu, both social activists, wondered why neither the Bharatiya Janata Party nor the Congress allowed the Vidhan Sabha sessions to function. “Important Bills and even the Budget are passed without discussions. Does the electorate elect the MLAs for this,” they asked.

Jagdish Chandra Jakhmola, a retired teacher, wanted the MLAs not to disturb Vidhan Sabha proceedings and seriously debate how disasters could be mitigated in Uttarakhand. The Centre should also make efforts by forming a group of well meaning experts to suggest measures to minimise losses caused by natural calamities and also pitch in with liberal funds for repairing or reinforcing infrastructure, he said.

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, after consulting with religious leaders such as Shankaracharya Swaroopanand Saraswati, ordered the officials to immediately send a team to Kedarnath to clear the area of debris and cremate the dead bodies lying there with traditional rituals after postmortem and collection of DNA samples. A ‘mahayagya’ will be held in Haridwar on the 13th day of the tragedy for the peace of the departed souls, Mr. Bahuguna said.

Mr. Bahuguna also said the rehabilitation of Kedarnath shrine was a top priority of the gand it will be carried out after taking suggestions from the Archaeological Survey of India.

Mr. Bahuguna said that the welfare of the disaster-hit villagers was equally important and necessary rations and medical care was being rushed there. “The damaged roads and bridges were making access to the remote areas difficult,” he said.

Second survey

Mr. Bahuguna ordered the rescue teams to make a second survey of areas from where pilgrims had been rescued to make sure no one was left out. The Chief Minister wanted the officials to keep a backup rescue plan ready in view of forecasts of more rains in the coming days.

Union Minister Harish Rawat, who trekked about 18 km from Rudraprayag to Augustmuni on Sunday morning, told The Hindu over phone that devastation in the villages was extensive and it would take a lot of time to bring things back to normal. Mr. Rawat who visited Gauchar also said the ITBP was doing an excellent job in the village-to-village search for survivors in the Kedarnath-Lambagarh area. A large number of houses, hotels, vehicles and agriculture fields have been washed away, Mr. Rawat said.

Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, along with senior Congress leaders Moti Lal Vora and Ambika Soni, reviewed the relief centres set up in Rishikesh and Dehradun.

Mr. Hooda said that 50,000 blankets would be sent for people stranded at various place in Uttarakhand and, out of these, 25,000 blankets had already been dispatched from Panipat on Sunday. He said that buses of Haryana Roadways had been deployed to carry rescued persons from Dehradun, Rishikesh and Haridwar to their destinations free of cost.

The Baluakot and Jualjiwi villages in district Pithoragarh were some of the worst-affected with some of the villagers trekking through hazardous areas to the district headquarters and taking shelter in the homes of relatives or friends. Pramod Tamta who reached the district headquarters said that nearly half of the houses, shops and agricultural fields in Baluakot and Jualjiwi had been washed away.

Heart-rending scenes could be witnessed at the Sahasradhara helipad and Jolly Grant Airport in Dehradun where hundreds of relatives could be seen frantically showing photographs of their kin to the rescued pilgrims, asking them if they had seen their loved ones.",,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 23, 2013","Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Pithoragarh",200 mm,"1000+ houses, hotels, vehicles and agriculture fields washed away","5,700+","Thousands of pilgrims and villagers stranded, many missing",The floods were caused by a cloudburst that triggered landslides and flash floods in the Kedarnath valley.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday announced a financial assistance of Rs. 1,000 crore to Uttarakhand for disaster relief. Of this, Rs. 145 crore would be released immediately.

In a statement made after an aerial survey of the hilly regions of the State, where torrential rains wreaked havoc and caused extensive damage in the past few days, Dr. Singh said he had directed all Central agencies to render all possible assistance in their capacity to the State. UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi accompanied the Prime Minister during the aerial survey.

Dr. Singh announced ex-gratia assistance of Rs. 2 lakh each to the families of those killed and Rs. 50,000 each to those who injured from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF).

Further, the Centre would provide from the PMNRF ex-gratia assistance of Rs.1 lakh each to those whose houses were completely destroyed and Rs. 50,000 each to those whose houses were damaged.

“We saw for ourselves the large scale devastation that has been caused in the State. Our hearts go out to the families of those who have lost their lives and those who have suffered injury or loss of property in this huge tragedy,” the Prime Minister said. The priority for the authorities was to rescue the stranded persons and provide relief to the affected people.

“Assessing the magnitude of the losses, both in terms of lives lost and houses destroyed, or the damage to buildings, roads and other infrastructure, is an exercise that will take some more time,” he said. Dr. Singh added that both he and Ms. Gandhi were distressed by the devastation caused by flash floods and rains.

While estimates put the death toll at 102, it was feared that loss of lives could be much higher. So far, more than 10,000 people had been rescued and were being provided food, clothing and shelter. Many persons were still stranded. The maximum damage was in Kedarnath and its vicinity, Dr. Singh noted.

The Central and State governments would continue to work in close coordination to ensure that every possible effort was made, not only to provide immediate relief to the affected people, but also to help them reconstruct their lives, Dr. Singh said.",solution,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 20, 2013","['Kedarnath', 'Rudraprayag', 'Chamoli', 'Pithoragarh', 'Uttarkashi']","['Kedarnath: 300 mm', 'Rudraprayag: 250 mm', 'Chamoli: 200 mm', 'Pithoragarh: 150 mm', 'Uttarkashi: 100 mm']","['10,000 houses destroyed', '100 bridges damaged', '13,000 km of roads damaged', '102 people killed']",,"['Thousands of people stranded', 'Major disruption to transportation', 'Loss of livelihoods', 'Environmental damage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

It is one week since Uttarakhand’s worst disaster in living memory. Flash floods resulting from extremely intense rainfall swept away mountainsides, villages and towns, thousands of people, animals, agricultural fields, irrigation canals, domestic water sources, dams, roads, bridges, and buildings — anything that stood in the way.

A week later, media attention remains riveted on the efforts to rescue tens of thousands of pilgrims and tourists visiting the shrines in the uppermost reaches of Uttarakhand’s sacred rivers. But the deluge spread far beyond the Char Dhams — Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath — to cover the entire State. The catchments of many smaller rivers also witnessed flash floods but the media has yet to report on the destruction there. Eyewitness accounts being gathered by official agencies and voluntary organisations have reported devastation from more than 200 villages so far and more affected villages are being reported every day. Villagers whose homes, lands and animals have been swept away by the floods are in a state of shock trying to imagine day-to-day survival without their basic livelihood assets.

Distorted coverage

The national media’s focus on the plight of tourists has grossly distorted the true nature of the tragedy even in the Char Dham area. It has not reported on the fate of the thousands — almost all male — who come from the villages in these valleys (and elsewhere) to earn a major part of their families’ annual income on the yatra routes during the tourist season. They help run the dhabas that line the entire 14 km trek route from GauriKund to Kedarnath; they sell raincoats, umbrellas, canes, walking sticks, soft drinks, water bottles, home-made snacks and other supplies. On their backs, they carry children, the old, the infirm and tourists who are simply unfit and out of shape to walk the entire route. They run along the path with their ponies or horses carrying yatris.

Local residents tell of village after village in the Mandakini valley below Kedarnath resounding with wails from homes whose boys and men have not yet returned and are now feared dead. One village near Guptkashi alone counts 78 missing.

The tragedy of the families dependent on religious tourism for much of their annual income is compounded by the fact that the yatra season is over for the year, and is unlikely to resume even next year given the destruction of the roads and bridges in the upper reaches. Several thousand Char Dham valley families will now fall below the poverty line. Till the revival of the yatras, what will be the alternative sources of employment for the newly unemployed? Most likely we will see increased male outmigration from the region.

Last week’s disaster not only spelt doom for thousands of household economies but also dealt a grievous blow to Uttarakhand’s lucrative religious tourism industry. With the media focus almost exclusively on the fate of pilgrims, the scenes of the deluge and its aftermath will linger on in public memory, making the revival of tourism doubtful in the foreseeable future. The abject failure of the State government, political leaders and the administration is therefore likely to impoverish the State coffers too.

The scale of participation in the kaanwar festival that starts in July — when about a million people throng to the banks of the Ganga at Hardwar over a couple of weeks and take back Gangajal to their homes — will be revealing. The pressure on the State government will continue through September when the Nanda Devi Raj Jaat (yatra), a once-in-12-years event, is scheduled. A detailed discussion on the future of Uttarakhand’s tourism industry is not possible here but it is clear that it requires a radical overhaul. With the ineptness of the State government now fully exposed, new policies for the revival of tourism in Uttarakhand must follow an open debate.

Not a ‘freak’ incident

The impact of the floods on Uttarakhand’s tourism leads to larger questions of what kind of development Himalayan States should pursue. Before delving into that, it is important to understand the nature of the rainfall that deluged the State. Already several voices are arguing that the deluge is a random, ‘freak’ event. Odisha’s super cyclone in 1999, torrential rains in Mumbai in 2005, and now the Uttarakhand downpour constitute three clear weather related events in less than 15 years, each causing massive destruction or dislocation in India. These can hardly be called ‘freak’ events.

Several reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have repeatedly warned that extreme weather incidents will become more frequent with global warming. We are already riding the global warming curve. We will have to take into account the likelihood of more frequent extreme weather events when planning for development, especially in the fragile Himalayan region where crumbling mountains become murderous.

In the 1990s, when the demand for a separate State gained momentum, at conferences, meetings, workshops and seminars, Uttarakhandi people repeatedly described the special character of the region. Consciousness created by the pioneering Chipko Andolan raised the hopes of village women that their new State would pursue a green development path, where denuded slopes would be reforested, where fuel wood and fodder would be plentiful in their own village forests, where community ownership of these forests would provide their men with forest products-based employment near their villages instead of forcing them to migrate to the plains, where afforestation and watershed development would revive their dry springs and dying rain-fed rivers, and where the scourge of drunken, violent men would be overcome.

Year after year — in cities, towns and villages — they led demonstrations demanding a mountain state of their own. Theirs was a vision of development that would first enhance the human, social and natural capital of the State. Recalling the tremendous worldwide impact of the Chipko movement, Uttarakhandi women dreamed of setting yet another example for the world of what people-centric development could look like.

But in the 13 years after statehood, the leadership of the State has succumbed to the conventional model of development with its familiar and single-minded goal of creating monetary wealth. With utter disregard for the State’s mountain character and its delicate ecosystems, successive governments have blindly pushed roads, dams, tunnels, bridges and unsafe buildings even in the most fragile regions.

In the process, denuded mountains have remained deforested, roads designed to minimise expenditure rather than enhance safety have endangered human lives, tunnels blasted into mountainsides have further weakened the fragile slopes and dried up springs, ill-conceived hydropower projects have destroyed rivers and their ecosystems, and hotels and land developers have encroached on river banks.

Yes, wealth has been generated but the beneficiaries are very few — mainly in the towns and cities of the southern terai plains and valleys where production investments have concentrated. In the mountain villages, agricultural production has shrivelled, women still trudge the mountain slopes in search of fodder, fuel wood and water, and entire families wait longingly for an opportunity to escape to the plains.

Last week’s floods have sounded an alarm bell. To pursue development without concern for the fragile Himalayan environment is to invite disaster. Eco-sensitive development may mean a slower monetary growth rate but a more sustainable and equitable one.

Terrorism

There is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. You should remain vigilant at all times.

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.

Terrorism in India

Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in India.

There is a heightened risk of terrorism in some Indian regions. Read our advice on regional risks in India for more information.

Terrorist and insurgent groups operating in India include:

Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LET), Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM) in Kashmir

Naxalite (radical communist insurgent) groups active in India’s eastern states

Khalistani extremists operating mainly in Punjab

Daesh (formerly referred to as ISIL), Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), and other groups may also be planning attacks

Terrorist attacks have mainly targeted Government of India interests. Security has been strengthened, notably at major hotels and transport hubs. However, terrorist attacks could be indiscriminate, including in places frequented by foreign nationals, such as:

restaurants, hotels, bars, and markets

stations and airports

places of worship and tourist attractions

festivals, sports venues, and beaches

Take particular care during periods of national or religious significance, such as:

Republic Day (26 January)

Independence Day (15 August)

Diwali (usually in October or November)

Eid (date changes each year)

Stay aware of your surroundings, keep up to date with local media reports and follow the advice of local authorities.

Political situation

Strikes (sometimes referred to as ‘bandh’ or ‘hartal’), political rallies and demonstrations occur frequently and can become violent. The risks are higher during elections and after the death of party or government leaders. Protests may also occur at short notice, especially around days of national importance. Local authorities may impose curfews and other restrictions at short notice. Transport and public services including mobile and internet network coverage may be disrupted at short notice.

You should:

avoid protests or large gatherings, including at religious sites

follow the advice of the local authorities and your travel company

monitor local media and follow any curfew restrictions

Crime

If you’re the victim of crime, call Police helpline number 100 or National Emergency Number 112 and ask for police assistance.

India’s Women Helpline Number is 1091.

Protecting your belongings

Keep a copy of your passport, visa, and flight ticket separately from originals when travelling. Leave copies at home where others can access them, and also store them electronically so you can access them easily. If your passport is lost or stolen, tell the police immediately and get a police report.

Take particular care of your possessions on buses, trains and in crowds. Criminals may ride past on motorbikes and snatch valuables.

Be cautious in tourist areas, where scammers, pickpockets and ticket touts target foreigners.

Scams

Cybercrime, internet scamming, card skimming, and confidence scams are common. These scams come in many forms and can pose great financial loss for the victims.

Criminals often use the details of British High Commissions and embassies to carry out their fraud. Be cautious and check the authenticity of details before responding.

Drink and food spiking

As in the UK, be wary of accepting drinks or food from strangers or of leaving drinks unattended. There have been reports of spiked drinks and food, with travellers, including British nationals, subsequently being robbed, or assaulted.

Sexual assault

Sexual assaults occur. This includes attacks on foreign female visitors in tourist areas and cities.

Female travellers often experience verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men. Serious sexual attacks involving both Indian and foreign nationals have been reported. British women have been victims of sexual assault, including rape, in Goa, Delhi, Rajasthan, Mumbai and Kerala. Avoid isolated areas, including beaches, when alone at any time of day.

Read our advice for women travelling abroad.

Laws and cultural differences

There may be serious legal penalties for doing something which may not be illegal in the UK.

Dress code

Women travelling in India should respect local customs and dress codes.

Alcohol laws and bans

Laws on alcohol, including buying, drinking and the legal drinking age, vary by state. Get advice from your travel agent, hotel, or the authorities about the laws in areas you are visiting.

It is an offence to drink alcohol in public places, such as public parks.

In some states, foreign nationals and non-resident Indians can buy 30-day alcohol permits.

There is often a ban on the sale of alcohol during major religious festivals, national holidays, and elections.

The consumption, production or transportation of alcohol is banned in:

Bihar

Gujarat

Mizoram

Nagaland

the region of Lakshadweep

Manipur

If you drink or possess alcohol in these states, you could be arrested without bail. Charges can carry a prison sentence of 5 to 10 years.

Smoking and e-cigarette bans

Smoking is banned in most public places. You should only smoke in designated smoking areas.

E-cigarettes and related products are banned. You will be unable to buy e-cigarettes in India or bring them into the country.

Illegal drugs and prison sentences

Do not get involved with any illegal drugs. Drugs are not categorised as they would be in the UK, into Class A, B and C. There is a minimum sentence of 6 months for possession of small amounts deemed for personal consumption only. A 10-year sentence for possession of other amounts applies. The judicial process is slow and being detained for several years whilst your case is processed is normal.

Using cameras and binoculars in secure areas

Activities involving cameras and binoculars, like photography, bird-watching, or plane spotting, may be misunderstood. Be particularly careful near military sites, government buildings, airports, and railway stations.

Swimming safety

Every year, several people drown due to strong currents in the sea. There are strong currents off many coasts. Most beaches do not have warning signs, flags, or lifesaving equipment. Take local advice, follow warnings and instructions issued by lifeguards. Emergency service standards may differ from those in the UK.

Trekking in India

Trekkers should:

travel in groups

use reputable local guides and stay on established routes

check if you need any special permits

Leave details of where you’re going and when you expect to return with your accommodation. You are extremely unlikely to have a phone signal in the mountains, so make sure your accommodation provider registers your whereabouts using the online C-form.

It is illegal to possess or operate satellite phones without prior permission of the Indian authorities.

The following hazards exist throughout the year, especially above 3,000 metres (m):

altitude sickness - see our advice on Health in India

sudden weather changes, including thunderstorms

avalanches and snow drifts

landslides, flooding, and rock falls

Make sure your insurance policy covers you for altitudes over 2,400m and mountain rescue and helicopter costs.

There are no commercial mountain rescue services operating above 3,000m. In some border areas only the Indian Air Force can carry out air rescues. However, they are under no obligation to perform them and only carry out rescues during working hours.

LGBT+ travellers

Same-sex relationships are legal in India. However same-sex marriage is still illegal. Indian society remains conservative. This includes attitudes to LGBT+ people, which can be less accepting than in the UK. There is a risk of harassment and discrimination, especially outside of big cities.

Showing affection in public can receive unwanted attention.

Read our advice for LGBT+ travellers.

Child custody and family law

Indian family law is very different from UK law. Special caution is needed when child custody becomes an issue. In case of dispute, consult a local lawyer to find out more about the relevant laws.

Commercial surrogacy is illegal for foreign nationals in India. Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) can seek legal guidance on surrogacy if at least one partner is an Indian passport holder.

Wildlife, animal products and souvenirs

It is illegal to buy, sell, kill, or capture any protected wild animal or trade its parts without a licence. India has a strong legal framework to regulate and restrict wildlife trade and is also a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). If you’re caught purchasing or trafficking such goods illegally, you will be prosecuted and receive a prison sentence or fine.

Sexual offences against children

The penalties for child sex offences are severe. There is a minimum jail term of 20 years, which may go up to life imprisonment, or a death sentence for those convicted of raping a child aged under 12.

Transport risks in India

Be wary of unofficial transport at airports.

British tourists have been scammed by drivers who offer cheap transportation or hotels, unwanted tours, and extended taxi rides. Travellers who accept these offers have reported being threatened with violence when they have declined to pay.

Taxis and rickshaws

When using taxis or rickshaws:

avoid travelling alone and hailing taxis on the street, especially at night

use official taxi ranks. Pre-paid taxi services are available from inside all airport terminal buildings and many hotels offer transfers. Ride-hailing services like Uber and Ola are also widely available in India

if you’re being collected at the airport by a hotel driver, make sure they properly identify themselves before you set off

if you book a taxi online, there’s usually a way to share journey details with your contacts who can then follow your location

Cars and motorbikes

Road accidents including car and motorbike accidents are one of the biggest causes of injury and death overseas. Police figures estimate more than 150,000 people are killed every year in road accidents across India. Several British nationals are either injured or killed each year on Indian roads.

Road traffic hazards include:

reckless driving and manoeuvring

poorly maintained vehicles

poor quality and congested roads

roads shared with pedestrians, carts, cattle and other livestock

vehicles running red lights

protests - see our advice on the Political Situation in India

extreme weather and natural disasters - see our advice on Extreme weather in India

Driving in India

If you are planning to drive in India, see information on driving abroad.

You can drive with a UK licence and an accompanying international driving permit after you arrive, but rules on how long you can drive on a UK licence vary from state to state.

Driving can be dangerous in urban and rural areas due to wandering livestock, including cows. Cows are considered sacred in India and road accidents involving cows can draw crowds or potentially lead to violence. If you are involved in a road accident, you may be attacked or become a victim of extortion, even if you were not driving the vehicle. If you hit a cow or pedestrian, you should comply with the police if they are at the scene. If the police are not present, it could be unsafe to remain at the scene of an accident of this nature, if safe to do so you may prefer to find the nearest police station.

It is common to use your horn or flash your headlights frequently to announce your presence on the road.

If possible, avoid travelling at night and in fog as accidents are common due to low visibility and there is a higher risk of crime at night. Always travel in a well-maintained vehicle. Seatbelts are not common in three-wheel taxis (autos) or in the back seats of taxis. Try to use only cars that have seatbelts.

If you travel by motorbike, wear a helmet and proper footwear.

Buses are a convenient mode of transport, serving almost every city across India. However, they are often driven fast and recklessly. Accidents are common.

Vehicles drive on the left in India. Pedestrians should exercise caution when crossing streets, even in marked pedestrian areas and especially at night, as vehicles sometimes drive on the wrong side of the road.

Air travel

When you are travelling through an airport, allow enough time to complete check-in and security procedures, as your baggage may need to go through screening equipment and checks. Allow time for transiting between flights if you need to change from international terminals to domestic terminals, even if using the airport shuttle service.

Tourists flying on charter flights booked through a tour operator can only fly into and out of the country by using the services of the same charter operator. Chartered flight passengers are not permitted to fly on inward or outward journeys using a scheduled airline.

Rail travel

India has a large passenger train network throughout the country. Although train travel in India is generally safe, accidents do occur and have previously resulted in death and serious injury. There are police or guards on trains and stations if you need help.

When travelling by train:

do not accept food or drinks from strangers

thefts are common - take care of your passport and valuables

avoid people at railway stations offering tickets and tours as you may be scammed

Sea travel

Tourist boats and other small crafts rarely carry life-saving equipment.

Although piracy has not so far affected India’s territorial waters, it poses a significant threat in parts of the Indian Ocean. Mariners should follow shipping industry guidelines on precautions to take.

Ships and crew must have the necessary authorisation and paperwork before entering Indian territorial waters and abide by Indian laws and regulations. If carrying weapons on board ships in Indian territorial waters, you must follow Indian laws and regulations.

Extreme weather and natural disasters

India can experience extreme weather events that can be hazardous to life and disrupt infrastructure, including buildings, roads, and communications.

Plan your travel so that you are aware of seasonal weather events, such as monsoon rains, as well as what to do if there is a natural disaster. Follow the advice of local authorities and your travel company. Consult the Indian Meteorological Department for local and international weather updates.

Monsoons

Highest risk: June to October

Monsoon rains can cause:

flooding and landslides, sometimes leading to significant loss of life

towns and villages to be cut off for days

serious disruption to road and train travel

disruption in big cities due to flooding

other services including telephone lines, internet services and electricity supply to be affected

Cyclones and tropical storms

Highest risk:

East coast of India (September to December)

Bay of Bengal (April to June and September to December)

South India (June to November)

Tropical cyclones can cause:

high winds: buildings can be damaged or destroyed, trees, power and telephone lines toppled, flying debris can be dangerous

storm surges: can provoke a temporary rise in sea level of several metres which can flood coastal areas and damage buildings on the shoreline

very heavy rainfall: this can cause localised or widespread flooding and mudslides

See our advice on Extreme weather and natural hazards for more information.

Earthquakes

Several parts of India lie on highly active fault zones (including areas of the North and North-east). The most active are along the length of the Himalayas. Earth tremors are common in these regions and can cause landslides. Limited emergency response vehicles, equipment, and medical facilities could increase the impact an earthquake has.

Technology-driven efforts are on to crowdsource information using the Internet and other communication channels and integrate it into online maps to help manage the aftermath of the natural calamity that has beset Uttarakhand.

The international experience in recent years has proved that ‘crisis mapping’ can make a difference to disaster situations.

One such Uttarakhand flood relief effort, that aims to make use of ‘digital volunteers’ in India and other parts of the world to aggregate information from diverse sources and make it more useful and actionable has been launched by Hemant Purohit, a Crisis-Response Coordination researcher at the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis), Wright State University.

And there exists an International Network of Crisis Mappers, which includes members with different skill sets, and experience in the use of tools covering crowdsourcing, mapping, use of aerial and satellite imagery, geospatial platforms, advanced visualisation and computational and statistical models.

What the volunteers are doing is to monitor different channels of information on Uttarakhand, including official sources, blogs, social media, non-governmental organisations, public networks and the news media to generate ‘situation reports’ and also update with vital information an online crisis map set up by the >Google Crisis Response team (http://google.org/crisismap/2013-uttrakhand-floods? gl=in). The map has information on rescued people, cleared areas, people stranded, relief camps, medical centres, road networks and so on.

Information flow will gather momentum as the repair and restoration of the mobile phone network progresses in Uttarakhand.

Google had also set up an instance of its webapp, Person Finder, that makes it possible for information about missing persons to be posted online and searched, with the option of triggering alerts.

The role of crisis mapping was to bridge the gap that existed between information-seekers and providers, particularly when it came to providing insights into the situation on the ground and the action that needed to be taken, Mr. Purohit said in an e-mail interview to The Hindu .

Haiti earthquake

The world got a glimpse of the potential of crowdsourced mapping following the deployment of an open-source platform called Ushahidi when an earthquake hit Haiti in 2010. The information provided by the affected population and others over the Internet and the mobile phone network and the map-based capabilities of the platform helped in addressing specific disaster management requirements.

In the case of the Haiti earthquake, a volunteer team got the platform going fast and were soon tapping into social media sources like Twitter, facebook, and blogs and other media to create actionable reports. Later an international SMS number was created for people to input information relating to the quake. Soon it turned into a flood which was painstakingly processed by volunteers and turned into information that could be loaded onto an online map.

As many as 4,636 project volunteers translated 25,186 SMSs and numerous e-mails, web, and social media communications, resulting in 3,596 reports that were actionable and included enough relevant information to be mapped on Ushahidi, said a United States Institute of Peace report.

Now the trend was to try to use automation to process such large volumes of information.

“Until recently, much of our crisis response and disaster coordination relied on manual effort using web infrastructure. Ushahidi is an excellent and successful example. More recently, there is rapid progress on our ability to use automation — especially in processing large amount of information shared on social media,” said Amit P.

The national highway between Dehradun and Srinagar is currently broken at Byasi and Devprayag, with silt measuring upto 10 ft. covering an enormous area, in Uttarakhand’s Pauri district.

According to the residents of Shakti Vihar, an area in Srinagar, this disaster occurred on June 17 at around 3.00 a.m. when the Srinagar dam authorities lifted the dam gates.

Ajay Uniyal, a resident, said, “The rainfall on June 16 was so much that the water reached up to our knees, and to add to it, the dam authorities released water without a prior warning.”

Mr. Uniyal said the silt was from the debris lying around the dam construction site. “The water swept all the debris lying around the dam construction site and deposited it here.”

Ritu Raj Singh, another resident, said, “Such an incident happened at Bhaktiyana in 1971 as well, but that year only water filled the area and everything became fine once the water level receded.”

According to the residents, the water level this time was three to four metres higher than the previous floods.

Aradhana Negi, a resident of Bhaktiyana, said, “People, whose houses have been destroyed, are taking shelter in some houses uphill and in some government guest houses while their belongings [whatever remain)]are lying on the terrace of their respective silt-filled houses.”

Pradeep Mal, another resident of the area, said, “Though residents were saved, cattle were killed under the silt.”

“Quintals of fish that was the river brought along are also rotting under the debris,” said Mr. Mal.

Every person passing by the site could smell the rotten flesh. “This can cause disease but the authorities have not yet bothered to take any action,” said Ms. Negi.

A Services Selection Board (SSB) Academy, a gas godown, a ration godown, a silk farm, hundreds of houses, vehicles, and animals were affected by the massive flashfloods that hit Srinagar.

Ms. Negi said, “Every year the river water enters the houses that are near it. People complain, but the authorities do not bother to take action. Then monsoons end and people too become silent on the issue.”

In Odisha’s Ganjam district, where Cyclone Phailin made its landfall on Saturday evening, at least 200,000 houses and over 200,000 hectares of agricultural land have been damaged, making it the state’s worst casualty of the storm. Also, about 40 power transmission towers were uprooted by the cyclone, leaving most of the district without electricity and putting the national grid at strain.

Balasore, Mayurbhanj, Jajpur, Keojhar and Bhadrak districts in the state are flooded, and power distribution systems and grids have been severely damaged in many places, especially in Ganjam, by the severest cyclone to hit the country in several years, state government officials said.

Overall, 13 districts in Odisha were affected by the storm.

The flood situation is grim in Balasore and Mayurbhanj, special relief commissioner of Odisha, P.K. Mohapatra, said over the phone from Bhubaneswar, the state capital. Three teams of National Disaster Response Force and teams of the Orissa Disaster Response Action Force have been dispatched to the most affected areas, he said.

Cyclone Phailin lashed India’s eastern coast at Gopalpur in Ganjam district with wind speeds of up to 220km per hour around 7.30pm on Saturday, bringing heavy rains across south coastal Odisha and Srikakulam district of north coastal Andhra Pradesh.

Twenty-one people died and 11.9 million people have been affected by the cyclone and the ensuing floods in 128 blocks of the state, according to state administration.

Defence agencies have been pressed into action to airdrop food packets in flood-hit areas. In Balasore district, around 300,000 people are locked by floodwater.

Several areas in Odisha received very heavy rainfall of more than 150mm on Sunday. Balimundali village and Banki town received rainfall of over 350mm on Sunday. On Monday morning, the National Disaster Management Authority warned that Burhabalang river at the National Highway (NH) 5 Road Bridge in Balasore district of Odisha was flowing in “high flood situation"".

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), a “high flood situation"" warning was issued by the Cyclone Warning Centre for the Burhabalang at the NH-5 Road Bridge in Balasore district as it flowed 1.08m above its danger level on Monday.

“Very heavy rainfall can be expected in the plains of Bihar, over north Jharkhand, including Kosi and Gandak river catchments, in the next 24 hours,"" said L.S. Rathore, director general, IMD.

IMD in its latest bulletin added that sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim would also face very heavy rainfall for the next two days, including in the Teesta river catchment. West Bengal could face wind speeds of up to 74km per hour, in gusts, in the next 24 hours.

After heavy rainfall for the next two days, rainfall will start decreasing at many places over Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Gangetic West Bengal. IMD had issued a flood warning for Bihar on Sunday.

In Odisha, while operations at Bhubaneswar airport were resumed and the air traffic control was functioning at its optimum level, Indian Railways suffered an estimated loss of ₹ 12 crore due to the suspension of 165 train services to Odisha and Andhra Pradesh between Saturday and Sunday.

Air India Ltd said it has resumed its schedule, and all flights of private airlines are operating without changes.

“All operations are normal. We have operated three flights already. A fourth one is scheduled as per original schedule,"" an Air India spokesman said.

Some trains services have now been resumed. In addition to the Puri-Howrah section that was opened on Sunday, trains services on the Khundra road-Berhampur- Palasa-Srikakulam-Vishakhapatnam route were also restored, effectively restoring all train services from South India and Mumbai to Bhubaneswar.

While there is not much clarity on the damage to the rail infrastructure, a railway official, who did not want to be named, said: “We do not see significant damage to rail infrastructure.""

The health department in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha maintained that rapid response teams were taking stock of the situation in real time. In the worst-affected districts, the primary health concern is to ensure access to potable water, said G.V.S. Murthy, director of the Indian Institute of Public Health in Hyderabad.

“The government has an extensive mechanism in place, ensuring access to clean water, food and shelter. There has been minimal loss of livestock in the three worst-affected districts in AP (Andhra Pradesh). Our first worry is outbreak of diarrhoea. We do not have a threat of epidemics as yet,"" said the public health specialist.

“The state government has set up a committee to look at emerging public health concerns. Once water starts receding in these areas, the stagnation could lead to vector borne disease in the next few weeks. It is too early to address that aspect now. The hospitals have not shown any spikes in cases of diarrhoea either, which means people have access to safe drinking water,"" he said.

Large parts of Odisha are without electricity, leading to a blackout in 3,229 villages across Ganjam, which is spread over 8,070.6 sq. km. While the national electricity grid withstood the torrential aftermath of the cyclone, India is trying to cope with a sharp drop in electricity demand and its impact on the grid. This sharp fall in demand has strained the national grid network. The load is still under 100,000 megawatts (MW) from peak demand of around 127,000MW, according to officials managing the country’s electricity grid.

“Ganjam has been worst affected. Around 40 transmission towers have been uprooted. It will take a while for the supply to be restored in these areas,"" said a senior Power System Operation Corp. Ltd (Posoco) official requesting anonymity.

Load management functions are overseen by state-owned Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd (PGCIL) and carried out by its subsidiary Posoco. Regional load despatch centres are responsible for maintaining grid discipline and supervising optimum scheduling and delivery of electricity in their regions, and function under Posoco.

“All necessary facilities will be restored in almost all districts by Monday night, but Ganjam will take few more days as it was severely battered. We are on top of the situation and are monitoring it at the highest level,"" said Odisha’s special relief commissioner Mohapatra.

""Substantial damage to the 33/11kV distribution network in the coastal districts is reported,"" the Union power ministry said in a statement.

While PGCIL’s networks are fine, the electricity demand in the eastern region including Odisha has dropped, with the state’s load being only 1,400MW. Odisha has an installed power generation capacity of 4,682.1MW including the state’s share in central and joint projects. The state had an electricity demand of 3,448MW in August during peak consumption hours—normally between 8am and 11am, and 6.30pm and 10pm.

“Yesterday, we had taken a link out as a precautionary measure, but it was restored in a short while. While Odisha’s load is down, the load in the grid is also short by around 9,000MW due to the rainfall across the eastern region that has reduced demand. The demand is less than 100,000MW. Orissa’s state distribution network has been impacted,"" said the official quoted above.

“Our systems are intact,"" said PGCIL chairman and managing director R.N. Nayak.

Officials are still closely monitoring the grid as the eastern grid that supplies electricity to Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Sikkim and West Bengal is inter-connected to the national grid. Of the five regional grids in the country—northern, southern, eastern, north-eastern and western—all except the southern one are interconnected.

“As required, load and generation were managed in a balanced manner so as to secure stable transmission frequency. Load was not much affected in AP (about 9,000MW against normal demand of 10,000MW). In Odisha, it was reduced to 22-25%, about 600MW (normal demand is 2,800MW),"" the Union power ministry said.

“Interruptions in the Talcher-Kolar HVDC link at 3 locations around 23 hours/01.19 hours on 12.10.13/13.10.13, were restored in very short time of less than 30 minutes. Also, the southern connection was maintained through the alternate path of 1,000MW Gazuwaka HVDC back to back link. No AC PGCIL line tripped. However, up to seven lines of 400kV, 17 lines of 220kV and 19 lines of 132kV have been affected concerning the state grid. This affected the power supply in the state,"" the statement added.

For three days running, there was no reaction from the Bharatiya Janata Party to reports that the Gujarat Chief Minister, Narendra Modi, had evacuated ‘15,000 Gujaratis’ from Uttarakhand in the course of a two-day visit to the hill State. But with doubts growing over how such a feat was achieved, if it was achievable at all, the party finally broke its silence on Wednesday. BJP president Rajnath Singh said he had spoken to Mr. Modi who denied making any such claim. Mr. Singh also wondered at the source for the figure of 15,000. “Where did this come from”? he asked.

The journalist who first wrote the story with the ‘15,000 Gujarati pilgrims’ claim has come out with the answer. He said the figure emerged from Mr. Singh’s party, the BJP, itself. Anand Soondas — chief of the National News Features of Times of India (TOI), and Editor, Sunday Times — told The Hindu that his source for the figure was Anil Baluni, the BJP’s spokesperson in Haldwani in Uttarakhand.

Mr. Soondas said the conversation between him and Mr. Baluni had taken place in “the presence of Uttarakhand BJP president, Tirath Singh Rawat, a bunch of youth leaders from Gujarat and a couple of bureaucrats from Gujarat.” Mr. Soondas said he had asked them if they were sure if all those taken back were Gujaratis, and the answer was in the affirmative. Mr. Baluni is quoted in the story as saying, “It’s amazing what he (Modi) has done here.”

The Hindu called Mr. Baluni to confirm if he had indeed given the story to Mr. Soondas but he first asked to be called later and then switched off the phone. He was unreachable till late in the evening.

Headlined, “Narendra Modi lands in Uttarakhand, flies out with 15,000 Gujaratis’, Mr Soondas’s story had appeared in The Times of India on June 23. The story made many claims in addition to the rescue of 15,000 pilgrims. Among them: requisitioning of four Boeings and 80 Toyota Innovas by Mr. Modi towards passage of the rescued pilgrims; air-dropping of a complete medical team on Hardwar; and setting up of camps across the flood-hit areas.

The Gujarat Chief Minister’s supporters greeted the news in jubilation, citing it as proof of his super-managerial skills, and saying that the performance of the Centre, the Uttarakhand Government, and even the Armed Forces, had paled in comparison. BJP office-bearers hailed Mr. Modi’s effort as a model to be emulated by the Centre and other States.

But soon, criticism started on two grounds. The first punctured the ‘15,000’ figure, with several reports showing how it was logistically impossible to conduct such an ‘evacuation’ operation in the limited time span and in the prevailing weather conditions. Others pointed out that even if true, the act of only rescuing Gujaratis, did not enhance the image of a prime ministerial aspirant. It was after this that Rajnath Singh stepped in and questioned the veracity of the story.

Mr. Soondas was unfazed by criticism that he had not exercised due diligence in presenting the 15,000 figure as fact. He said: “I believe rescuing 15,000 people over four days is actually possible since it refers to providing them food, transport, logistics.” He defended the pitch of the story, and argued: “It is not possible to say everything in the introduction. The headline seems to have brought a sharper focus to the story.”

In the past few days, a spate of new stories and blogs — sourced to Gujarat government officials — have made fresh claims about Mr. Modi’s rescue efforts in Uttarakhand and praised him for showing the way forward in disaster management.

Over two months after Kedarnath shrine was ravaged by devastating floods in Uttarakhand, efforts are on in full swing to ensure that prayers resume by September 11 as planned even as priests say that much will depend on weather conditions.

“Preparations are going on. There is a meeting on August 25 in Dehradun to take a final call on whether the prayers can begin on the proposed date as we have to consider the weather conditions also. Everyone wants that prayers begin as early as possible,” Rawal Bhimshankar Ling, the chief priest of Kedarnath told PTI from Devangere, Karnataka.

Uttarakhand chief minister Vijay Bahuguna had announced earlier this month that prayers will resume from September 11.

A 40-member team consisting of PWD and revenue department personnel reached Kedarnath this week to expedite debris removal exercise and complete other arrangements even as most places across the state were lashed by light to moderate rains.

“Prayers will be held with all the rituals. We will perform a purification prayer first which will include havan.

After that the traditional prayer will begin under the guidance of priests,” said the priest who is in Kanavkuppi math in Devangere, Karnataka for ‘shravan rudrabhishek’ which is dedicated to those who died in Kedarnath tragedy this year.

“Many people want to see the prayers but we have to keep the weather conditions and arrangements in mind. Once the prayers get resumed Bagesh Ling, the present priest of Kedarnath temple and other staff will remain there till the doors get closed on November 5,” he said.

Bagesh Ling, who was inside the temple on the fateful day, is in Ukhimath now and waiting for prayer to get resumed.

“We are collecting all the necessary stuff for purification and traditional puja,” Bagesh said.

“Prayers will be offered to Kaal Bhairav first. Then we will offer Balbhog to Kedarnath, after that there will be Abhishek and Shringar of God and we will offer Mahabhog. There will be a Sampoorna arti in the evening. This is the tradition and will be followed till the doors are closed for winter,” he said.

He also said that all the idols brought to Ukhimath after the floods will be taken back to Kedarnath.

“We had brought the movable idols of Ganesh, Parvati, Shankar, Kaal Bhairav and Shaligram to Ukhimath but now we will take them back to Kedarnath. After offering bhog to them, the prayers can resume,” he said.",solution,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

The horsemen refused to take them downhill. So did the porters. They had seen rains in the hills, but this downpour was something else. With no other choice, 16-year-old Libni Garg and family decided to trek down to base camp Gauri Kund from Kedarnath in the state of Uttarakhand. A peaceful pilgrimage suddenly took a different turn on the morning of June 16, 2013. “It was freezing…it rained so much that raincoats were pointless,” says Libni, speaking over phone from Dehradun. “We finally managed to hire two porters.” Libni’s story of struggle and survival will be featured in Himalayan Tsunami , a documentary that will be aired on the Discovery Channel.

Boulders cracked and trundled past them; bridges collapsed and rains beat against them with a vengeance. Libni and family moved on, desperate to reach safe ground. Once at Rambada, located 7 km from the base, they decided to rest for the night. Little did they know of the danger that awaited them the next morning.

Rains poured all night while they slept fitfully. Libni’s family was stranded. “The owner of the lodge in which we stayed was over 70 years old. He told us that not once in his lifetime had he seen floods rise over the first step of the building. But that day, water had reached the fifth step,” she recalls. The locals had never experienced such rains — there was chaos everywhere. “We were compelled to walk against the stream back to Kedarnath,” says Libni.

It was during this trek that Libni was witness to something she would never forget. A wall of water thundered past them, dragging along houses, utensils, cattle… As thousands lost their lives and everything they held close to the floods, Libni and her family walked on, forcing themselves not to look back. For it was the best they could do for their survival. “I asked my dad where we were going. And he said ‘I don’t know’,” says Libni. “That was when I got really scared.”

They reached level ground at last and rested their tired feet when suddenly — “A local shouted ‘Run, water!’” They did so without second thought. What followed were long hours of starvation; sleepless nights; and journeys that seemed to have no end or purpose. “Even the food packets the Government dropped from helicopters did not reach us,” says Libni. For, they were stranded in the remotest of corners. Help arrived at last on the morning of June 20 — they were airlifted by the Army along with other survivors. For Libni, who studies in a boarding school in Dehradun, the experience taught her the value of life. “I won’t take anything for granted,” she says. “Problems that seemed big before appear trivial now.” Will she be going to Uttarakhand again? “No,” she says. “I don’t think I’m going back.” Himalayan Tsunami, to be aired at 9 p.m. on December 23, looks at “what really happened” during the Uttarakhand disaster and “why”.",flood,2013 Uttarakhand floods,"Uttarakhand, India","June 16, 2013","June 20, 2013","['Kedarnath', 'Rudraprayag', 'Chamoli', 'Pithoragarh', 'Uttarkashi']","['Kedarnath: 300 mm', 'Rudraprayag: 250 mm', 'Chamoli: 200 mm', 'Pithoragarh: 150 mm', 'Uttarkashi: 100 mm']","['1,000+ people killed', '100,000+ people displaced', 'Rudraprayag bridge destroyed', 'Kedarnath temple damaged', 'Infrastructure damaged']",,"['Loss of lives', 'Loss of property', 'Disruption of livelihoods', 'Environmental damage']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe

Had the elemental fury of flash floods not rained down on Uttarakhand last week, June 18 (June 19, according to some almanacs), would have been a day of festivity and ritual for Hindu devotes across north India. They would have relived the mythology of the Ganga’s descent from heaven to earth with a dip in its waters at various pilgrimage centres.

Ganga Dussehra – celebrated on the tenth day of the waxing moon in the third month of the Hindu almanac – usually coincides with the opening up of ice-bound holy sites such as Kedarnath, Badrinath, and Gangotri.

This time, however, the sweeping devastation along the banks of the Ganga in Uttarakhand, with Kedarnath feeling its full force, swiftly transformed the mood from celebration to mourning.

In the midst of so much grief, how do we reflect on the mythology of Ganga’s descent in a way that it enables us to comprehend a tragedy of this magnitude, and perhaps relearn a relationship between human and nature that is life-affirming. For that to happen, it is necessary to look beyond the veil of ritual surrounding this myth. At its core, this mythology is made up of aspects which have been integral to people’s ways of life in mountains, lived in full awareness of the towering presence of nature.

Two narratives

The myth of Ganga’s descent contains two very different narratives. The first part is a narrative of power. At its simplest, the story of Ganga’s descent starts on a note of hubris, with a proud king called Sagara whose ambition is to conquer the world. As it becomes clear that there are few to rival Sagara, the gods above intervene. Sagara’s 60,000 arrogant sons (all born of one of his wives) are reduced to ash by the wrath of sage Kapila for having disrupted his meditation. King Sagara dies of grief. For his sons, now mere heaps of impure ash, there is no salvation for generations on end.

Then, Bhagiratha (descended from the son of Sagara’s second wife) ascends the throne, and from here the narrative of the myth changes track. Deeply stirred by the fate of his ancestors, he leaves his throne to undergo two long and increasingly severe penances in the Himalayas. The gods are pleased. Thus Ganga descends from heaven to be caught in the locks of Shiva, who alone can withstand her tempestuous force.

Bhagiratha performs his third penance, whereupon Shiva releases Ganga in several streams. Ganga follows Bhagiratha across mountains, forests and plains to the end of the world where his ancestors’ remains lie. Midway, the wilful Ganga scatters sage Jahnu’s sacrificial offerings and he swallows her up in rage. Bhagiratha performs one more penance to have her released yet again, showing enormous reserves of persistence.

Finally, Bhagiratha leads her to his ancestors’ ashes at Ganga Sagar. Having purified their ashes and paved their way to heaven, Ganga disappears into the ocean.

Origins of a name

That’s how the originating head stream of the Ganga gets its name Bhagirathi, say people, the other major headstream of the Ganga being the Alaknanda. These two headstreams, nourished by several others (such as the Mandakini, flowing alongside Kedarnath) come together as the Ganga, which flows across the plains until it reaches the Bay of Bengal.

The myth of Ganga’s descent resonates at different levels in the lives of the people of Uttarakhand. At one level, the story of Ganga getting tangled in Shiva’s locks or inexplicably disappearing seems entirely believable in a geological landscape that has seen rivers changing course, or getting blocked — swallowed by tectonic disturbances.

In a wonderfully layered article written in 1994, well-known writer, poet and cultural theorist Pria Devi pointed out an interesting ecological aspect of Ganga Dussehra: “It falls at the leanest moment in the annual cycle of the river, at the precise moment when, before the rains, she begins to swell with snowmelt at her source.” It is as if the Ganga comes down from the heavens every year.

At another level, this story provides the alluvium of cultural resources for a society to shape its ecology of existence. That is, if one stays connected to its core. Thus, in a land where nature resists all attempts at ‘domination’ or ‘subjugation’, it is Bhagiratha, not Sagara with his goal of world conquest, who emerges as a heroic figure, articulating a different narrative of power. The qualities emblematic of this valorous figure: his ‘powers’ of persistence, humility, and selflessness.

Pria Devi puts it succinctly: “What distinguishes Bhagiratha and explains his great popularity as a culture hero, is his non-violence, and his remarkable patience. He is quite clear about means and ends. His ends are selfless. It is not his own moksha that he seeks. Equally, he will not seek his ends by applying his will outwardly as a force.

He turns inwards....By the integrity of his self-government he compels outward sanction to his inner motives.” This strand of cultural memory can be a potent resource for resistance, for it implies that notions of conquest – of humans or nature – be replaced by the idea of conquest of the self and its excess appetites, whether it is an individual, or society.

Cultural memory

Like a river this cultural memory flows through space and time — now a subterranean existence, now a rapid current over ground. And when it does surface, it lays bare civilisational faultlines such as an exclusionary narrative of power impervious to the political ecology of inclusive instincts. In post-independence India, this cultural memory surfaced in the 1970s to herald a new phase of protest — environmental resistance — that one might term a ‘Bhagiratha prayas’ (the Hindi equivalent for Herculean effort). This phase was accompanied by the articulation of a whole new discourse of Constitutional guarantees such as equality and citizenship emerging from the margins of the Republic, from the Narmada valley to present-day Niyamgiri hills.

In Uttarakhand, too, the past four decades have seen noteworthy movements of environmental resistance built on this principle, such as the 1970s Chipko movement spearheaded by village women like Gaura Devi, which is considered India’s first green movement. From the 1970s to the 1990s, Gandhian activist and environmentalist Sunderlal Bahuguna through long fasts, and many others such as Professor Vinod K. Gaur and other experts of Himalayan geology, questioned the long term impact of big dams such as Tehri (built on the Bhagirathi), on the fragile ecological balance of the Uttarakhand region. As for the Ganga, listed among the 10 most endangered rivers of the world by the Worldwide Fund for Nature, it still awaits the collective conscience of a Bhagiratha to come back to life.

Role of greed

The qualities symbolised by Bhagiratha also exist as part of larger contemporary discourses, when we speak of sustainable development, disparities within nations and between hemispheres, or limiting consumption by putting a leash on gluttony.

The story of Bhagiratha and Ganga is as relevant today, if not more. As news filters in of the near totality of nature’s devastation in Uttarakhand, it is becoming clear that humans have played their part in exacerbating the sheer scale of the disaster in terms of lives lost and property destroyed. Unchecked construction and increasing encroachment on the flood plains of the Ganga to accommodate more and more residential buildings, hotels and tourist rest houses in the name of development, have extracted a huge human cost for a Sagara-like conquest of the environment.

Similarly, in the aftermath of the 1991 Uttarkashi earthquake, experts had pointed to the man-made factors responsible for large-scale destruction: the explosion of inappropriate building techniques and materials in the march to ‘modern progress’ frequently accompanied with a disdainful neglect of local wisdom. Over the years the nature of protest may have changed, but the issues of entrenched interests vis-a-vis forest, mineral and water resources still remain; on the contrary, they have become more acute.

Due to a range of factors, the catastrophe which brought forth a terrifying side to the Ganga not witnessed in recent times, occurred around the time of Ganga Dussehra.

Yet seen in conjunction, the disaster and the mythology seem to be pointing to the same truth: ritual observance on an appointed day may be important, but is certainly not enough. It is equally significant to internalise the essential spirit and reality of the story of Bhagiratha and Ganga, and, for that, the pact between the self-reflexive human and nature needs to be revived.

Prayers resumed at the Kedarnath shrine on Wednesday morning after the Gandhi sarovar overflowed and flooded Kedarnath on June 17.

The prayers, which were resumed within 3 months of the catastrophe, started at 7 a.m. on Wednesday. Vageeshling, who is a representative of the Rawal (chief priest) said, “Rawal Bhimashankar Ling started the purification of the temple along with other priests, people from the State administration, and the members of the Badrinath-Kedarnath Temple Commiittee.”

Prayers started after the purification was over, Vageeshling said.

Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna was unable to attend the prayers as inclement weather prevented him from travelling.

A rock, believed to have saved the temple from the floods by preventing the flood waters from destroying the temple, was also worshipped. Some priests have named the rock Divya Shila (divine rock) while others call it the Bheem Shila.

The prayers continued till evening. Rameshwar Jamloki, a priest in the temple said, “From Thursday, the prayers will start in the morning and will continue till the evening. This routine will be followed till the beginning of the Diwali festival after which the prayers in the temple will be over for the year and will resume only next year.”

The prayers started on May 14 this year but stopped on June 17. Between June 17 and September 11, Vageeshling continued the prayers of the Bhog murti, which is a symbol of lord Shiva. The Bhog murti was shifted to Garudchatti on June 18. From there, it was moved to Okhimath on June 20 and it continued to be worshipped there before it was brought to Kedarnath temple for the prayers.

On Wednesday, around 300 people attended the prayers. Dilip Jawalkar, District Magistrate, Rudraprayag, said, “In the last one month around 800 people have been deployed here, including the people from the Public Works Department, hydel power, and water department.”

The police, the National Disaster Response Force personnel, and members of the National Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) were also stationed here.

The June 17 deluge had destroyed the buildings around the Kedarnath temple. The landscape is covered with the after effects of the deluge. Though the prayers have resumed, it would take many years for Kedarnath to be rebuilt.

A three-member team from the Geological Survey of India (GSI) has been mapping the Kedarnath area from September 9. The GSI would give a report to the government based on which the rebuilding of the area would take place.

The NIM has currently placed tents 2 km away from the temple. Some pre-fabricated huts have also been placed here. Water facility and electricity have been resumed in the area.

Mr. Jawalkar said locals, who live nearby, can visit the temple after taking the authorities’ permission. Pilgrims, however, would not be allowed to visit the temple till September 30.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

As many as 123 bodies were recovered from the Kedarnath shrine premises in Uttarakhand after a team of experts scoured the venue on Saturday. The death toll from the flood calamity is now 680.

“Kedarnath has been totally cleared of pilgrims now and the next step would be to evacuate pilgrims from Badrinath, where nearly 8,000 people are still stranded,” Uttarakhand Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna told reporters here on Saturday.

The Chief Minister said the restoration of the Kedarnath shrine was a priority and the State would take suggestions from the Archaeological Survey of India.

The Chief Minister said the casualty figures could easily touch the 1,000-mark.

More bodies may come to the surface in the next couple of days as the slush and debris lying in the area is being removed, said the official who did not want to be quotedMr. Bahuguna said both Central and State governments were trying their best to rescue stranded people. He said out of the 1,000 pilgrims sighted in Junglechatti area near Gaurikund earlier today, 400 have been evacuated. Food and medicines have been provided to the rest.

Mr. Bahuguna said the evacuation would be hastened after broken roads were restored: “I take heart from the fact that 529 breached roads have been repaired by the PWD. Pilgrims are being brought to Haridwar from Fata and Guptkashi areas.”

He said the bodies recovered would be disposed of as per traditional rituals and a Mahayagya held in Haridwar on the 13th day of the tragedy for the peace of the departed souls.

Even as criticism has been levelled about the efficiency of the rescue efforts in the State, some survivors were all praise for the Army.

Sukhvinder Singh, a Ludhiana native who was stuck for eight days on the way to Hemkunt Sahib, said: “The Army gave us food and water and helped us. Had they not been here, we wouldn’t have survived.”

Aman Bisht, who organises annual treks to the gurudwara, said: “The road links were shattered and we had no bridges left. And even if there was a road somewhere, it was broken. The Army has been very supportive.”

Family members and friends of those, who are stranded or missing in the hill state, have come to the capital city and are desperately searching hospitals and camps to get some news about their loved ones.

Another man alleged that “priority is being given to foreigners while Indians are left behind to die. My children have been stranded there for the last eight days without food and water.”",flood,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

As layer upon layer of debris is gradually hauled away to reveal to us the numbing scale of death and destruction in Uttarakhand, you can’t but help wonder whether it could trigger a crisis of faith and redefine the complicated relationship involving man, society and god. The prevailing contours of this relationship are fraught with elements conducive to the severity with which disasters strike India.

All natural calamities, from tsunamis and earthquakes in Asia to tornadoes in America, fundamentally challenge the notion of god as omnipotent, omniscient, and all-loving. This challenge now seems enhanced manifold as the tragedy in Uttarakhand also befell the thousands who were on pilgrimage to the four dhams — of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri. Their religious fervour pulled them to the Himalayas, in the hope of earning benediction and salvation. For them to die in what was for them moments of extreme piety, or see their relatives perish in torrents of water or get crushed under rolling boulders, not only seemed frightfully irrational but an unpardonable betrayal by the god (or gods) who they had gone to worship.

No doubt, the unpredictable ferocity of nature, indiscriminate construction, and environmental degradation combined to wreak mammoth destruction in Uttarakhand. Yet the believer, irrespective of whether or not his or her religious heritage entails treating reality as illusion, can’t but ask the questions that the atheist typically poses: is not god supposed to protect people, at least the pious ones, from calamities? What wisdom does god have in raining down destruction on the world?

These questions constitute the arsenal of philosophers who argue against the existence of god. They broadly divide evil into two categories — horrific actions man perpetrates against others and disasters or accidents which claim lives. If god existed, all-powerful and all-loving, wouldn’t he have created a world without evil, unless, obviously, he derives perverse pleasures from the suffering of people? Their ideological rivals counter it saying a world without evil would have made free will redundant, and blurred distinctions between good and repugnant.

Contrary response

The free-will argument is relevant to the evil that man wilfully spawns, such as massacres, but can’t be extended to devastating earthquakes and floods. It is a consequence of, from the perspective of faith, the will of god. Yet, as the votaries of faith argue, the scale of destruction can be mitigated through measures humans can take. For instance, constructing buildings resistant to earthquakes in areas vulnerable to this geological phenomenon, or keeping ready a disaster management plan, or, as in Uttarakhand, not raising structures in flood plains or denuding forests that help check landslides.

Though the atheists justifiably cite the economic costs some of these measures entail — the owner of a thatched hut can’t make it earthquake-resistant, can he? — to argue against the existence of god, the believer, nevertheless, could incorporate elements of the atheist’s arguments to revisit and redefine the idea of god.

Unfortunately, the disaster in Uttarakhand has triggered a contrary response. Many believe the dead were blessed for they were called to the abodes of gods, or holy places, to breathe their last, glossing over the torment they must have experienced as their life withered away. This is almost a universal response to pilgrims dying, say, in a stampede in the Haj or kumbh melas , and underscores the attempts of humans to reconcile themselves to what is cruelly incomprehensible. Yet, it is contradictory for the pious to praise God in the same breath for choosing some to die, and for saving many others from being crushed, as has happened in Uttarakhand.

Through such beliefs we seek to rationalise the randomness of life and inject meanings into absurd situations. From this perspective, god is turned into an imperious lord, killing people or keeping them alive in accordance with his whims. Obviously, the faithful believes the actions of god have a higher reasoning beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals, who are condemned to take birth or die at an appointed hour.

Selective

In our attempts to reconcile to what is seemingly incomprehensible we have not only turned irrational but also compromised the value of human will. Despite the terrible tragedy in Uttarakhand, there is a whisper of astonishment at the Kedarnath temple having remained intact even as several buildings around it were washed away in the floods. A leading Hindi daily, boasting multiple editions, featured on the front page of its national edition two photographs of the area in which the Kedarnath temple is located, depicting the scene before and after nature wreaked havoc. The combined caption to the photographs says, “Nature destroyed everything but call it coincidence or miracle, no harm came to the abode of Baba Kedarnath.”

In the second frame, clicked post-devastation, are also visible a few structures, which the caption blithely ignores. We don’t know whether those buildings were damaged or defied the fury of nature because of “coincidence or miracle.” This selective assigning of meaning portrays God as selfish, raining down havoc on people even as he insulated a place of worship from devastation.

Could there not be geological or architectural reasons for the Kedarnath temple withstanding the impact of gushing waters? Is it not possible that the building material of the Kedarnath temple, presumably sourced locally, was superior to the bricks and mortar constructions of the present times? Might not this world view explain our indifference to, say, building laws, sound architectural principles, and rapacious violation of the environment?

Such questions are not largely asked as commercial gains accrue from promoting a religiosity of an irrational kind. Traditionally, pilgrimage and yatras symbolised a rite of passage, an enduring of physical hardship and spiritual confusions, to pay respect to gods in their abodes. Modernity has made possible instant spirituality, as thousands are ferried by buses and cars, even helicopters, for paying obeisance to god.

What is needed is to rescue god from meanings and attributes we assign to him. In this, the priestly class could play a vital role. But what hope can we derive from stories of pujaris walking away with the donations, running into lakhs of rupees, of which a portion must have been the contribution of those who perished in Uttarakhand?

As the outfall sluices at different places have failed to work, flood waters inundated several villages such as Pasarlapudi and Kothalanka in Mummidivaram mandal, Appalaramuni Lanka, Lock Thota, and Gondi in Sakhinetipalli mandal.

Though water is receding slowly, the woes of people living in Lanka villages are far from over.

However, the flood level in the Godavari is steadily receding.

Irrigation officials withdrew the third warning signal as the water level had come down to 16.30 feet at Sir Arthur Cotton barrage in Dowleswaram on Tuesday evening. About 17.03 lakh cusecs of water is being discharged into the sea. The water level may increase again due to heavy rains in the catchment areas of the Godavari. East Godavari district Collector Ms. Neetu Prasad said that 1.75 lakh people living in 75 villages of 20 mandals in the district had been affected by floods and preliminary loss was put at Rs.115 crore. She said that 1.72 lakh milk and water sachets had been distributed to people living in relief camps. More than 27 lakh food packets had also been distributed. In all, 27,000 people had been shifted to relief camps. She added that the district machinery was making all efforts to ensure safety of people as well as cattle.

Tuesday was the 15th day for most of the villages in Konaseema to be logged in flood waters. Venomous snakes are entering the villages. It has become difficult for farmers to graze their cattle.

Amalapuram RDO Sampath Kumar said revenue officials were evacuating the people as well as transporting relief material in trying circumstances. He said sanitation would be a priority once water receded.

Meanwhile, Rampachodavaram Sub-Collector Gandham Chandrudu directed officials to focus on sanitation in the flood-affected villages in Devipatnam mandal. He said bleaching powder was being sprayed in all the affected villages to prevent outbreak of communicable diseases.

The unexpectedly early and powerful rains over Northwest India have killed over 130 people and left 70,000 pilgrims stranded, damaged temple towns, and washed away roads and 21 bridges in Uttarakhand. And we still don’t know the extent of deaths, injuries and damage because of the impaired connectivity.

In climate literature, rainfall more than 150 mm in a day is termed a very heavy rain event. Dehradun “on Monday morning registered a record rainfall of 340 mm. This amount of rain in June is seen almost after five decades,” said the regional director of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) >(The Hindu, June 18, 2013) . The unfolding disaster raises two questions: is this extreme rainfall due to global warming? And what issues does it flag?

A study by scientists at the National Atmospheric Research Laboratory, Tirupati, showed a six per cent increase in the frequency of very heavy rain events in India over 1901-2004. The more recent period 1951-2004 shows a 14.5 per cent rise per decade. They lay this at global warming’s door: the study talked of a “coherent relationship” between the increasing trend of extreme rainfall events in the last five decades and the increasing trend of Indian Ocean sea surface temperature ( M. Rajeevan et al , “Analysis of Variability and Trends of Extreme Rainfall Events Over India Using 104 Years of Gridded Daily Rainfall Data,” Geophysical Research Letters, 35, September 2008). Another school of thought emphasises regional rather than global factors. For instance, Subimal Ghosh et al found an increase in the geographical spread of rainfall extremes in India, but emphasised urbanisation, deforestation and other changes in land use more as causal factors (“Lack of Uniform Trends but Increasing Spatial Variability in Observed Indian Rainfall Extremes,” Nature Climate Change , 18 December 2011).

Single events and climate

Neither argument seeks to connect single rainfall events to global warming. It is in the nature of its methodology that it is not possible to ascribe single rainfall events to climate change. Climate change is a trend over time. However, as extreme events become more frequent in the world, some scientists are trying to grapple with this problem. One group tweaked the question a bit. They have argued that certain recent extreme events — the heatwaves and droughts in Moscow in 2010, and Texas, Oklahoma and northern Mexico in 2011 – were a consequence of global warming “because their likelihood in the absence of global warming was exceedingly small” ( James Hansenet al , ‘Perception of Climate Change’, PNAS, 6 August 2012, pp. 2415-2423). Hansen et al showed that extreme temperatures exceeding 3-sigma (a measure of variability and volatility), which covered only 0.1-0.2 per cent of the Earth’s land area in the 30-year period 1950-1980, occurred in as much as 10 per cent of the planet’s land mass in recent summers. Would the heatwaves they refer to have happened in the absence of this huge spread of extreme warming? No.

But note that even this study is largely linking specific temperature anomalies to global warming, not rainfall events. I believe that this methodological impossibility in ascribing single rainfall events, however extreme, to climate change, bolsters the already prevalent complacency about climate change in Indian officialdom and even the denial of global warming.

The picture changes when one considers recent trends. Extreme rainfall events are spreading in India. The Uttarakhand State Action Plan on Climate Change admits to a “few high rainfall events in the recent past” (Govt. of Uttarakhand, SAPCC Revised Version, June 2012, p. 24). People consulted did report erratic rains and increased frequency of intense rainfall events (p.27). There’s no doubt in my mind that this increasing variability and intense downpours are a consequence of global warming, due to the capacity of warmer air to hold more water vapour. It happened last year in Uttarkashi, it’s occurred this year again. It’s going to continue to happen, frequently.

This raises three issues. Surely adaptation means not just desperate rescue during and after extreme rains, but preparing for them. Experts suggest prior warning systems are feasible, with reasonable investment. Given there was no warning from the IMD, what technological or administrative improvement do we need to ensure that advance warnings are issued before such future events? Two, that needs not just technology but political will. We need to collectively challenge the callous indifference that most political elites have for the lives and livelihoods of the poor. And three, even assuming a best-case scenario of capacity, efficiency and political will, what impacts and devastation are inescapable in a difficult and mountainous terrain? What we are currently experiencing is in a world 0.9°C warmer than pre-industrial temperatures. Due to the lag between carbon emissions and global warming, a significantly warmer world is inevitable, as are more extreme events. What has happened this year is going to happen, again, often, and more intensely.

A week is a long time in the Himalaya. In the late 1980s, I visited Arunachal Pradesh as a young researcher, with a keen interest in photography. I walked into the middle of the Dibang river, hop skipping over boulders, until my local tribal guide ordered me to return immediately. He smiled and said, “Sir, these mountain rivers are like daughters, you never know how quickly they grow up.” I was humbled by his knowledge and haven’t forgotten the lesson.

Back to the present. During a just-concluded 10-day visit to the Bhagirathi valley, our research team witnessed telltale signs of a catastrophe ready to strike. At Uttarkashi, we viewed the destruction caused by the Assi Nadi (a tributary of the Bhagirathi) a couple of years ago. We noticed the river’s waters flow strongly against a number of houses and cheap hotel buildings, precariously perched on its weak banks.

The next day we left for Gangotri, but couldn’t go beyond Maneri village because a massive landslide had washed away the road about six to eight kilometres upstream. As a result, there was a long line of stranded buses, cars and trucks. Fortunately, the Garrison Reserve Engineer Force (GREF), an arm of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) and the police worked overtime and made sure there was little chaos on the road as it opened. Harsil was biting cold and the rain incessant. We returned to Uttarkashi the same evening and to the safer Dun valley the next day.

Deforestation

On the television, news of the devastation in Uttarkashi had started pouring in. It was painful to see the buildings, photographed only the previous day, being washed away like toys by the Bhagirathi.

There is little doubt that the present Himalayan disaster has been triggered by natural events, but the catastrophe is man-made. Let us address the various man-induced drivers. One, there is ample scientific evidence that the Himalayan watersheds have witnessed unprecedented deforestation over a long period. Deforestation as a commercial activity began during the British Raj and has continued unabated after independence. While official estimates say forest cover has increased in the Himalaya, a number of credible independent studies have found significant discrepancies in this claim. The fact is that forests have been diverted for a host of land use activities such as agriculture, human settlements and urbanisation. Massive infrastructure development such as hydropower construction and road building has taken place. Scientific studies indicate that at the current rates of deforestation, the total forest cover in the Indian Himalaya will be reduced from 84.9 per cent (of the value in 1970) in 2000 to no more than 52.8 per cent in 2100. Dense forest areas, on which many forest taxa (groups of species) critically depend, would decline from 75.4 per cent of the total forest area in 2000 to just 34 per cent in 2100, which is estimated to result in the extinction of 23.6 per cent of taxa restricted to the dense Himalayan forests.

Global warming

Vegetative cover slows the speed of falling rain and prevents soil erosion and gully formation — the precursors to landslides and floods. Dense vegetation, by evapotranspiration, also stops nearly 30-40 per cent of rainwater from falling to the ground, thereby significantly reducing run-off. Besides holding the soil together, forests and soil soak water from the rain, release it slowly and prevent water flowing as run-off. So, deforestation brings about slope destabilisation, landslides and floods. Given that the Himalayan range is geologically young and still rising, it makes the area vulnerable to erosion and instability. Therefore, it is all the more necessary to take land use change more seriously.

Two, there is mounting evidence that global warming is fast catching up with the Himalaya. In a recent study, we reported that Himalayan ecosystems have experienced faster rates of warming in the last 100 years and more than the European Alps or other mountain ranges of the world. In such a scenario, we expect faster melting of glaciers causing higher water discharges in the Himalayan rivers.

Expanding settlements

Three, expanding human settlements and urbanisation which, besides bringing about land use changes offer themselves as easy targets to the fury of natural forces. While it is important to appreciate the aspirations of the local people and their economic activities, there cannot be a lack of enforcement of land use control laws on the part of local governments and officials. Huge building construction, cheap hotels and individual dwellings at Uttarkashi, on the banks of the Assi and Bhagirathi rivers have been allowed. There is little buffer between the river and the human settlements.

Four, large-scale dam building in recent years has caused massive land use changes with ensuing problems in the Himalayan watersheds. Hydropower and allied construction activities are potential sources of slope weakening and destabilisation. Massive intervention in the Himalayan ecosystems through manipulation of rivers and their hydrology, is linked to what we are witnessing today. Most downstream damage in otherwise flood-free areas is caused by dams and barrages, which release large volumes of water to safeguard engineering structures. Dam operators often release more water during rains than the carrying capacity of downstream areas, causing floods.

Pilgrims

Five, neo-religious movements, linked to changing socio-political developments in India, are responsible for significant human movement into the Himalaya beyond the region’s carrying capacity, whether it is Amarnath in Jammu & Kashmir, Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Hemkund in Uttarakhand.

The heavy pilgrim population has also resulted in the mushrooming of shanty towns, cheap accommodation and numerous ramshackle buildings along river banks.

What is the road ahead? There needs to be an integrated policy on the Himalayan environment and development. Enough information is available in the public domain, which only needs to be put together and looked at in a cohesive manner. Himalayan State governments need to consider imposing high environmental tax on visitors, particularly during summer and monsoon months. Heavily sizing down pilgrim numbers in fragile areas must begin. All vulnerable buildings need to be either secured or relocated away from rivers. Governments must impose penalties on building structures within 200 metres of river banks. Hydropower policy must consider building fewer dams and prioritise those that have the least environmental and social costs. Independent and serious monitoring of the catchment area treatment plans proposed by Forest Departments with funds from hydropower companies needs to be carried out and reported to the Green Tribunal.

In some of the reaches the same is composed of conglomerate, which is highly susceptible to erosion. The high discharge in the rivers resulted in very high velocity causing erosion at the toe of the bank and subsequently slope failure of bank engulfing the roads/ building constructed near to the bank,” he said quoting scientific studies in this regard.“It was due to the existence of large storage in the Tehri Dam that was helpful in absorbing a substantial amount of flow in the Bhagirathi river. The flood situation in the reach downstream of Devprayag could have been further worsened in absence of the Tehri Dam. The highest observed discharge in river Ganga at Haridwar was about 5.25 lakh cusec during the current episode. This could have been more than 6.5 lakh cusecs in the absence of the Tehri Dam,” Kaushal claimed.One of the measures scientific committees he said, “For the losses to remain at minimum in the region, large dams should be constructed, wherever feasible, on Alaknanda/ Mandakini/ Pindar headstream of the Ganga river system. These storages could be operated in a manner to provide opportunity for absorption of flood in unfavourable condition. Possibility of storage dams on tributaries may also be explored.”Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology have also in their preliminary technical report on Kedarnath valley devastation given the observations that torrential rains caused vast floods in Mandakini, Saraswati, Madhu and Dudh Ganga catchments, resulting in excessive flows across all the channels. Very active erosion began due to this excess flow in all gulleys/ streams causing excessive water and sediment accumulation in the rivers. On June 17 2013 the moraine dammed Chorabari Lake was breached due to the impact of huge glacial avalanche trigged on the western slope of the lake and released large volumes of water that caused another flash flood in Kedarnath town leading to heavy devastation downstream, he said quoting the Wadia report.The main reason for the devastation was torrential rains which activated a number of new landslides and breach of moraine, dammed Chorabari lake due to huge glacier avalanche. Thus, it becomes clear that the Hydro Electric Projects, which are being portrayed as responsible for the natural calamity are not the reason behind the natural disaster.

Many people cut trees all over the world. These are people who do not know they are harming themselves by their action. Recently, there was news about the destruction of lives and property in Uttarakhand due to flash floods caused by a cloud burst. According to ecologists and environmentalists, one of the main causes of this catastrophe was deforestation.

Actually, people cut trees for the sake of luxury and money. Deforestation results in global warming, drought and famine. People should be made aware of the ill effects of deforestation. Organisations like WWF (World Wildlife Fund) should be encouraged in their efforts and guided in all possible ways to help promote preservation of forest land. If deforestation continues at the current rate, a day will come when the human species itself will be endangered.

The recent flood-related disaster in Uttarakhand was labelled a Himalayan tsunami, recalling the deaths, damage, and destruction that followed the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami of December 2004. Yet, this is a misleading metaphor, because there is little evidence that real tsunamis are linked to human activities that impact our oceans or sea-floors. In contrast, there is compelling evidence that climate change and the occurrence of >extreme meteorological events, such as the one in Uttarakhand are related to human activities that have altered our atmosphere through greenhouse gas emissions. In today’s world, many weather-related disasters are not merely chance occurrences.

Record high temperatures

Extreme weather and related disasters are becoming more common. In an analysis published in 2012, Munich Re, global insurance giant, reported that >disasters tied to extreme weather events have more than doubled worldwide since 1980. So far in 2013, many examples stand out — record high temperatures in Australia and the United States (including the highest June temperature — 54.0°C — in Earth’s recorded history at Death Valley, California), heavy rainfall and catastrophic floods in northern India, the U.S., Canada, Central Europe, and Argentina. Parts of the central U.S. also experienced record snowfall as late as May. Simultaneously, other parts of the U.S., such as southern Texas, are in the midst of record drought.

Extreme temperature swings are also increasingly common. Having endured a “bone-chilling” cold wave in January, parts of India were in the grip of a massive heat wave in May, and the risk of such heat waves is predicted to increase. Such swings are not uncommon in the U.S. either. For instance, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the city of Lincoln in the State of Nebraska registered a record low of 0.5°C on May 12, rising to a record high of 37.7°C within two days!

What’s behind these extremes? Is global warming responsible? After all, NOAA reported that the global average temperature for May 2013 tied with 1998 and 2005 as the third warmest May in 134 years of record-keeping. However, any single extreme weather event or natural disaster cannot be attributed solely to global warming, because day-to-day temperatures and long-term climate are also influenced by natural variability in local weather, larger-scale atmospheric and oceanic oscillations, and other factors such as solar cycles, volcanoes, and atmospheric pollution. Moreover, how could global warming be linked to both extreme heat and cold, or cause both record droughts and rainfall, snowfall, or floods?

Global warming refers to an increase in the worldwide average temperature, as has been observed in the last few decades. With an average trending higher, both record heat and cold events can and do occur, but more heat records are observed than cold as the overall distribution of temperatures shifts higher. In the U.S., for example, the ratio of record high-to-low temperatures has been increasing since the 1970s, and is projected to increase even more dramatically in the future. Justin Grieser of the Washington Post reported that in Washington, D.C., “daily heat records have outnumbered cold records … by a 7 to 1 ratio since … 2000 and by nearly 16 to 1 in the past 3.5 years.” According to a just-released report from the World Meteorological Organization titled The Global Climate 2001–2010: A Decade of Climate Extremes , a qualitatively similar trend is also evident worldwide in the last two decades.

Another way to view this shift is through the results of scientist James Hansen’s team at NASA, which showed that as average temperatures rise, the overall temperature distribution shifts higher, and heat extremes that would have had a very low probability of being observed 30 years ago are observed much more frequently today. The evidence is strong that global warming is the culprit: in a new paper in the journal Climate Change , climate scientist Dim Coumou and colleagues note that “… worldwide, the number of local record-breaking monthly temperature extremes is now on average five times larger than expected in a climate with no long-term warming.”

Unusual cold temperature records are also accruing, especially in the northern hemisphere. Strangely enough, a key reason for this is believed to be the extreme warming of the Arctic at twice the rate of the rest of the northern hemisphere (Arctic Amplification). As scientists Jennifer Francis and Stephen Vavrus have shown, drastic Arctic summer sea ice melt since the 1980s (equivalent to ~40% of the contiguous U.S. land area, almost equal to land area of India) and concomitant heat transfer to the Arctic Ocean could cause significant anomalies in atmospheric weather patterns, particularly in the north polar jet stream air current. As the anomalous jet stream meanders and lingers over parts of North America and Eurasia, it results in prolonged, extreme heat or cold events. Thus, increased temperature extremes are not just chance occurrences but partly due to global warming.

What about droughts and floods? The 2007 IPCC report observed that with global warming most climate models predict increased summer dryness and winter wetness in the northern hemisphere. Extended periods of high surface temperatures without adequate moisture and with a higher atmospheric capacity to hold water vapour can lead to drier soils and drought. There is growing evidence that global warming is partly the cause of the significant increase in aridity across the globe since the 1970s and associated record forest fires. At the same time, the vast majority of the warming in the last few decades has occurred in the world’s oceans. Greater evaporation of water into a warmer atmosphere capable of holding more water vapour has led to an increase in atmospheric water content by about 4 per cent since the 1970s. With such moisture-laden air delivered over land by storms, the likelihood of more extreme rainfall or snowfall and ensuing floods in some regions is increasing, as observed in the U.S. and India. As scientist Kevin Trenberth remarked, “… all weather events are affected by climate change because the environment in which they occur is warmer and moister than it used to be.”

What can we do about these disturbing trends? First, let us recognise the key cause of warming. There is now clear, overwhelming, scientific consensus among 97 per cent of climate scientists that current warming is largely man-made, fuelled by emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuels and human activities. In May 2013, the CO2 concentration in our atmosphere crossed 400 parts per million (ppm), up from about 280 ppm in the late 1700s. The last time the CO2 level was as high as 400 ppm was around 3-5 million years ago, when sea levels were much higher and regional climates were very different. Where we are today is unprecedented since the advent of modern human civilisation.

Second, we need to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and do so collectively across the world. Extreme weather events are not partial to developed or emerging economies. A global climate risk index indicates that warming is affecting most of the globe, especially Asia. The economic impact of climate change is also significant and growing. We must therefore accelerate a shift worldwide — away from fossil fuels and heavily carbon-intensive activities, towards new economic growth engines based on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon sequestration.

Poor adaptation

Finally, >human management of land and forests, rivers, and industrial livestock also impact emissions and can significantly influence the aftermath of extreme weather events. The Uttarakhand floods illustrated what could happen when an extreme weather event intersects poor mitigation and adaptation practices, ranging from unrestricted logging and construction on landslide-prone slopes to poor disaster management. Environmental mismanagement, too, can accentuate disasters. When natural forests and grasslands of mixed native species are destroyed, degraded, or converted to monoculture plantations of alien species it alters soils, reducing soil moisture retention and infiltration. This can make soils more prone to erosion and contribute to the twin travails of destructive floods and drying watersheds. A study from near Nainital in the Kumaon Himalayas by P.K. Rawat showed that between 1985-1990 and 2005-2010, the decline in natural oak forest cover and increase in barren land and mixed forest was accompanied by a 62 per cent increase in soil erosion rate, 15 per cent increase in flood runoff, and greater density of landslides in the watershed.

Still, this scenario can be turned around: conserving natural forests and grasslands helps avoid increased emissions, minimise soil erosion and surface runoff, increase water retention and sustain flows longer into the dry season, and buffer the impact of high rainfall events. Uttarakhand and other recent disasters are warnings to us highlighting the need to look beyond just near-term expediency and incorporate greater sensitivity to environment and climate concerns in our best practices across all sectors. Meanwhile, the climate clock is ticking.

CNN —

Record-setting rains in parts of the Midwest have caused hundreds of flight cancellations and flooding, with one northern Illinois hospital evacuating patients due to rising floodwaters.

Forty-four patients were removed Thursday from Morris Hospital in Morris, Illinois, due to the threat of rising floodwaters from the nearby Illinois River that had already soaked the two-story facility’s ground floor, said hospital spokeswoman Janet Long. Of those, 27 were transferred to other hospitals and 17 ended up going home or back to their nursing homes.

The evacuation was precautionary, Long said, adding that the hospital’s emergency department will remain open Friday – when the Illinois River is expected to crest around 7 a.m.

Along the same river about 25 miles west in Ottawa, a voluntary evacuation order has been issued for residents in the eastern part of that city, said LaSalle County emergency management official Connie Brooks. Some 100 people have already left two mobile home parks 10 miles farther west in Utica, she added.

Rising rivers are just one of the headaches tied to torrential rains in recent days. Back streets and highways have also been inundated by flash floods around Illinois, Indiana and elsewhere, while thousands of would-be air travelers have found themselves stranded.

In one 24-hour span reported Thursday afternoon – at a time when heavy rain was continuing to fall – some spots in the Chicago metropolitan area had seen nearly 7 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. To put that in perspective, the city averages 3.38 inches of precipitation for the entire month of April.

Wednesday was the sixth-wettest April day recorded at O’Hare International Airport. But that was just a taste: By 7 a.m., morning rain had already made Thursday the rainiest April day ever for Chicago.

By Thursday night, most flash flood warnings for the region had been canceled. But parts of seven states had flood warnings, some of which extend until next week, due to concerns about creeks and rivers overflowing their banks.

The North Skunk River in Sigourney, Iowa, for example, was at 22.1 feet and rising at 7:30 p.m. (8:30 p.m. ET) Thursday – well above the flood stage of 16 feet.

“About half the town” of London Mills – which equates to about 200 people in the central Illinois community some 35 miles west of Peoria – was evacuated Thursday as the Spoon River continues to rise well above flood stage, said the village’s police Chief Scott Keithley. At least seven structures are flooded, and parts of Illinois Route 116 are underwater.

“This is the worst flooding I’ve seen,” Keithley said.

And in Chicago, the Chicago River set a record when it crested at 8.57 feet, smashing the record of 7.86 feet set in 2008, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

The weather has also put a damper on many people’s travel plans.

The Chicago Department of Aviation reported at one point Thursday that more than 600 flights had been canceled. The situation had improved somewhat by night’s end, though, at which time the Federal Aviation Administration – for seemingly the first time in days – wasn’t reporting significant delays at the city’s O’Hare Airport.

American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said severe weather is affecting its hubs not only in Chicago but also in Dallas/Fort Worth. American and American Eagle have canceled 413 flights on Thursday because of weather, he said.

And Southwest Airlines spokesman Chris Mainz cited delays and cancellations because of weather in Chicago and storms in other parts of the Midwest.

Dehradun/Haridwar: Surrounded by dense green forest, with a waterfall nearby, the tiny village of Rambara was the most popular resting place for devotees trekking to Kedarnath from Gaurikund. But the flash floods that caused death and destruction at Kedarnath on June 16-17 spared none in Rambara. Nothing is left there, just nothing.

The entire area, which housed around 100-150 shops and five hotels, to serve the needs of the ever swelling number of pilgrims, was completely washed away leaving no trace of the once bustling hamlet perched at an altitude of 2591 metres halfway on the 14 km long trek to Kedarnath.

The floods have left Rambara under 10 feet of sludge. No one can risk a guess on the number of people washed away by the angry Mandakini river or worse still, lie buried under the heaps of mud and debris.

As per eyewitnesses, on June 16 at around 6.15 pm, water level in the Mandakini rose like a tsunami; huge waves of engulfed Rambara, sweeping away everything.

When the trail of death from Kedarnath reached Rambara after decimating upstream hamlets like Gadoriya and Gidurpharni, most of those present there were caught unaware. While the locals dashed up the surrounding hills, it was sometime before the pilgrims understood the killer force of the unfolding tragedy.

A few lucky ones escaped but most others were caught in the swirling waters and are yet to be traced. Many saw their near and dear ones being swept away but couldn’t help them. Torn between the option of saving their own life or risking it for others, the choice was tough.

One young man had no such confusion when his teenage daughter slipped from his tight grip and fell into a deep ditch by the gushing river. In a flash, he handed over the custody of his son to his relatives and against everybody’s advice, jumped into certain death – he wanted to do all he could to save his daughter.

Despite the fall having injured him, he searched for his daughter for over two hours before locating her lying unconscious near the river bank. He then carried her on his back all the way down the mountain to safety.

Others who escaped into the mountains surrounding Rambara had a harrowing time. While some lost the battle against hunger and cold, most wandered for days before they reached nearby villages or were evacuated by Indian Air Force choppers from Jungle Chatti - located between Gaurikund and Rambara.

While the government has promised to reconstruct Rambara along with Kedarnath and Gaurikund, the extremely sensitive location of Rambara may very well mean that it will not be rebuilt to its original state.

Avoidable tragedy

Noted environmentalist and Magsaysay awardee Chandi Prasad Bhatt has accused the Uttarakhand government of sleeping over a report of National Remote Sensing Agency and said had the government taken the report seriously, ""destruction in and around Kedarnath shrine would have been much less horrific"".

""The report identifies the areas around Kedarnath including Rambara, Gaurikund, Ghindurpani, and Garuriya, which have been the worst hit in the recent tragedy, as highly prone to landslides and natural calamities,"" he said.

The report, termed as `Hazard Zonation Mapping`, was prepared by around 100 distinguished scientists from country`s leading research institutes at the initiative of the Indian government and was submitted to the state government in 2001.

The expert panel had recommended a host of measures for the calamity sensitive area of the state and neighbouring Himachal Pradesh including planned mining, bio-technical measures for channelisation of water in the catchment areas of rivers near Kedarnath, afforestation of Rambada and Jungle Chatti areas, soil conservation and slope modification measures in Gaurikund besides construction of retention walls in Hanuman Chatti which have all been severely damaged in the deluge.

""Had even five per cent of the recommendations of the panel been implemented, the scale of destruction in and around the Himalayan shrine would have been much less horrific,"" he said.

A trainee employee of Tata Consultancy Services drowned and his colleague was reported missing at Meenmutty waterfalls, a weekend holiday destination in the densely forested foothills of the Western Ghats at Kallar, nearly 45 km from here.

Circle Inspector, Vithura, V.S. Pradeep Kumar identified the deceased as Mahesh Kumar, a resident of Haryana. He drowned when he entered the deep and turbulent pool at the base of the powerful waterfall to save his friend Athul Yadav, a resident of Rajasthan. Athul is yet to be traced.

Fire and Rescue Services divers and local people gave up their search for the missing person due to poor light and heavy rain around 5.45 p.m. The search will resume at daybreak on Thursday.

The police said the youth were part of a nine-member group of TCS employees. The youth, reportedly, had not heeded warnings of local guides, all employees of the Eco Development Committee (EDC), not to venture into the waterfall.

Bhagawan Kani, president of the EDC, said the youth had arrived at Kallar around 1.30 p.m. Sobhana Kumari and Leela, who manned the gate at the start of the 2-km thickly forested trekking path to Meenmutty, warned them not to bathe at the waterfall or wade into the large pool at its base.

The group reached the waterfall around 2.45 p.m. At the time, three ECD guides (Stephen, Soman and Karunakaran) were at the spot. They told the youth that it was raining heavily uphill and the possibility of flash floods could not be discounted. The youth said they would be cautious and the guides retreated to another spot to have lunch.

Cry for help

Police investigators, quoting other members of the group, said that Athul entered the pool first. He tried to float and was suddenly sucked into the depths. Mahesh entered the water to save his friend and he also drowned. The other members of the group shouted for help. But, the sound of the waterfall and rain drowned their cries for sometime.

The guides came to know of the incident around 3.20 p.m. and alerted the police. Karunakaran, amongst the first to reach the accident spot, saw Mahesh’s body “surface momentarily” near the base of the waterfall.

He entered the water through a relatively “safe and shallow” ford at the edge of the waterfall and secured it to a forest vine.

A ‘whirlpool’

The police said the waterfall had deepened the pool in an uneven manner. Local divers told them that it was more than 150 feet deep at certain points. During rain, the kinetic energy of the waterfall was so intense that the pool at its base became an “inescapable whirlpool”.

In the past, Kallar has often become a death trap for visitors. Perhaps the biggest tragedy so far at the tourist spot was when eight Government Dental College students died there in a flash flood in October 1991. In May 2006, four youth belonging to a group of weekend vacationers died at the Meenmutty waterfall.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

Politicians, Sindhi nationalist leaders, irrigation experts and growers have termed the continuous reduction in release of water from Indus River for Sindh despite many agreements “an act of water-terrorism.”





Action should be taken against those who have compromised the country’s rights on rivers through dubious agreements, speakers said at a conference on how to save Sindh from water shortage and floods organised by the Sindhi-language dailyThey were equally critical of the upper riparian province and the neighbouring country for creating droughts and floods at the tail end of the Indus River.The speakers said that instead of presenting demands to agricultural authorities, the growers should move courts to secure their water rights.Some of the speakers rose above political statements and suggested using technology to improve water management. Growers can get more produce by using laser technology to provide ideal elevation to watercourses and fields and drip and sprinkle irrigation, they said.PPP Sindh General Secretary Taj Haider in his presentation explained various steps the Sindh government has taken to improve the water situation in the province.He presented the results of a survey conducted by an international firm and said that the government has been working on restoring 18 natural watercourses from Khairpur to Badin by removing encroachments.He said that the survey company has proposed that water bypasses be constructed where these channels pass through cities, but implementation of this recommendation is too expensive. Therefore, the government opted for clearing the encroachments.The chief of the Awami Tehreek Rasul Bakhsh Palejo said that a petition has been filed with reference to Kalabagh Dam (KBD) in Punjab but Sindh’s stance on this petition is not known till date.He criticised the provincial authorities for taking the (KBD) issue lightly. If Sindh has taken a stance on this petition, it should be made public.He said that the chain of damage to Sindh started in Liaquat Ali Khan’s era. He said that Ayub Khan might have signed the Indus Basin Treaty with India, but Z A Bhutto, who represented Sindh in that committee, did not utter a single word and thus three rivers and their water were given to India. He said that it is the feudal lords of the province who have compromised the rights of Sindh.Qadir Magsi, chief of Sindh Taraqi Pasand Party, criticising the provincial authorities, said that the government is meant only to eat funds. “The irrigation officers don’t even sit in their offices, how can we expect them to represent the province at forums where distribution of Indus water is decided?”Magsi said the province needs a competent government to save the people from droughts and floods.He also pointed towards the land erosion of riverbanks due to illegal timbering. “The government must be blind that it cannot see swathes of forests cut down.” Trees are considered vital in flood control.Mehmood Nawaz Shah, General Secretary of Sindh Abadgar Board, a representative body of growers, said the irrigation system has become dilapidated. A substantial quantity of water is wasted due to damaged canals, he said urging people to make the best use of the available water.Agriculture expert Akhund Ghulam Muhammad Siddiqui said that the former Sindh Chief Minister Jam Sadiq signed the 1992 water agreement without consulting the growers.Chairman Fisher Folk Forum Muhammad Ali Shah said water theft is terrorism. He condemned the authorities for drastic cuts in release of water downstream Kotri Barrage.Reducing river flow in delta has led to sea incursion, he said. When the river stops flowing, there is no silt in the delta and seawater flows into empty channels. The sea incursion has devastated farming and freshwater fishing in the tail end areas of Thatta and Badin, he said.Chief of the Awami Jamhoori Party Abrar Qazi warned that water shortage could lead to a standoff between India and Pakistan. “We should on one hand prepare ourselves for a big war and on the other hand improve water management by adopting modern conservation techniques.”Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz leader Sagar Hanif was quite vocal in blaming the upper riparian province for water woes. “Punjab is responsible for the shortage of water in Sindh,” the Sindhi nationalist leader said.Former secretary irrigation Hashim Leghari, growers’ leaders Major ( r) Omar Farooq, Ghulam Mustafa Leghari and Tariq Arain also addressed the seminar.",issue,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

A Panama-registered cargoship carrying iron ore, MV Bingo, was reported to have sunk in rough seas off the coast of West Bengal, but the crew were spotted in a lifeboat by a Coast Guard Dornier aircraft.

In Andhra Pradesh, relief work was underway as teams of revenue department officials and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel fanned out to rescue people and assess damage, said Ekbote Vinod Kumar, assistant commissioner at the disaster management department of the state government.

In Odisha, the authorities set up 1,073 relief camps to house people who had been evacuated or had lost their homes. In Andhra Pradesh, 135 such camps were opened.

Phailin lashed the eastern coast at Gopalpur in Ganjam district of Odisha with wind speeds that went up to 220kmph around 7.30pm on Saturday, bringing heavy rains across south coastal Odisha and Srikakulam district of north coastal Andhra Pradesh.

According to the Indian Meteorological Department, on Sunday night, Phailin had weakened further, turning into “deep depression"" with a wind speed of 45-55kmph, and currently lay over northern Chhattisgarh, parts of Orissa and Jharkhand.

In Odisha alone, an unprecedented 873,000 people were escorted to the safety of inland buildings that could withstand ferocious cyclonic winds. Another 129,000 people were evacuated in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. The previous biggest evacuation was in 1990, when an estimated 650,000 people were moved in Andhra Pradesh for a cyclone, AFP reported quoting NDMA.

In Andhra Pradesh, people were evacuated from the low-lying areas of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts, highly vulnerable to Cyclone Phailin, the most powerful storm to hit India since the 1999 Odisha cyclone, when over 10,000 people perished.

The London-based think tank, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), praised Indian authorities for learning lessons from previous disasters.

“Credit is due to those who have been involved in efforts to reduce the scale of vulnerability to disasters across India. The low loss of life, following the strongest storm ever measured in the Bay of Bengal, would almost certainly not have been possible without learning lessons from previous cyclones and tsunamis that have hit this coastline,"" said ODI head of climate change Tom Mitchell.

But, he warned: “This is about livelihoods as well as lives. Over the two decades many parts of India—including Andhra Pradesh—will be increasingly exposed to disasters. The focus on how deadly disasters can be should not obscure the fact that many homes, hospitals, shops and schools will have been badly impacted in ways which will drive people into poverty.""

Torrential rains and gales with windspeeds of up to 185-190kmph brought normal life to a halt in north coastal Andhra.

Around 11 mandals (local administrative units) in Srikakulam were the worst hit, the government said, as power and communication lines went down across the district on Saturday. Transport services to the region were hit as most flights operating out of Bhubaneswar and Visakhapatnam were cancelled and several trains were either rerouted or cancelled.

The movement of vehicles on National Highway-5 that passes through Ganjam and Srikakulam districts also stopped.

“The state government took all preventive actions, to avoid any loss of human life,"" said Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy.

Around 2,300 personnel of NDRF were pressed into action to help the two state governments in the evacuation, said Marri Shashidhar Reddy, vice-chairman of NDMA and a legislator from Andhra Pradesh.

“This is the biggest deployment ever,"" Shashidhar Reddy said, adding that around 500,000 tonnes of food had been kept ready to feed the affected people.

The sea pushed as much as 40m inland in parts of Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts, said N. Raghuveera Reddy, revenue minister of Andhra Pradesh, who oversaw rescue arrangements from Visakhapatnam. From 1891 to 2012, Andhra Pradesh has been hit by 73 cyclones.

In Odisha, Phailin damaged crops over 500,000 hectares of agricultural land. In Ganjam district alone, where the cyclone made the landfall Saturday evening, 224,000 houses were damaged, disaster management minister Patra said.

The state may lose 1 million tonnes of rice output due to the cyclone and heavy downpour, Trilochan Mohapatra, director of the state-run Central Rice Research Institute in Cuttack, told Bloomberg. He added that winter-sown crop may also be affected because of sea-water inundation following the cyclone.

“There’s not much damage to the rice crops in Andhra Pradesh as of now,"" Mohapatra said.

Patra said due to heavy rains, at least four districts—Jajpur, Bhadrak, Ganjam and Nayagarh—are facing threat from floods. “We have alerted the district administration as the water level in several rivers is increasing,"" he added.

There were other looming challenges, including the threat of disease. In Odisha’s capital Bhubaneswar, Subhash Salunke, director of the Indian Institute of Public Health, said: “The biggest concern is the availability of potable water. We are looking at improving laboratory testing near water bodies to ensure additional outbreaks of vector-borne diseases can be controlled. “The government has been fully prepared and loss to manpower is minimal. Our job is now to reach isolated villages and ensure health systems are in place.""

NDMA said extensive damage to mud houses was expected in Odisha, in addition to “partial disruption of power and communication lines, disruption of rail and road traffic, potential threat from flying debris, flooding of escape routes (and) extensive damage to agricultural crops"".

Meanwhile, the nation was trying to cope with a sharp drop in electricity demand and its impact on the grid due to the cyclone. The load has dropped to 90,000 megawatts (MW) from around 127,000MW, according to top officials managing the country’s electricity grid.

The electricity demand in the eastern region including Odisha has come down from 16,000MW to 6,500MW. The eastern grid supplies electricity to Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Sikkim and West Bengal. With the distribution network being switched off, the demand in Odisha has come down, leaving large parts of the state without electricity.

“There are three reasons for this sharp fall in demand. The factories are closed on account of Dussehra; it is a weekend and then the weather systems brought in due to the cyclone,"" said a top government official overseeing the grid requesting anonymity. This dip in demand has strained the national grid network, with thermal power stations being taken off-line to stabilize the grid.

“We are waiting for the load to pick up in the region,"" said the official quoted above.

Odisha has an installed power generation capacity of 4682.10MW, including the state’s share in the central and joint projects. The state had electricity demand of 3,448MW in August during peak consumption hours—normally between 8am and 11am, and 6.30pm and 10pm.

Officials say that the worst is behind them with the grid being out of danger.

Several underpasses were blocked, roads and bridges were damaged and facilities were flooded under the onslaught of the heavy rains that have lashed at the Arabian Gulf this week, resulting in deaths and injuries and loss of private property.

In Kuwait, Abdul Aziz Al Ebrahim, the Minister of Public Works and Electricity and Water, has come under harsh criticism for the perceived failure to deal with the heavy rains that have affected the country in the past two days.

Reports in Kuwait said that the drainage system failed to take in the large amounts of rainwater, turning several areas into ponds.

Opposition lawmakers used the situation to level corruption charges against government officials and to accuse them of their lack of preparedness for rainfalls.

In Saudi Arabia, the authorities are in a challenging race against time and difficult weather conditions, are working on limiting damages and ensuring there would be no repeat of the tragedies of the western city of Jeddah on the Red Sea coast in which 10 people were killed in 2011 and dozens in 2009.

Civil Defence officers said that four people were killed and ten reported missing.

Two of the victims were in the capital Riyadh and the other two in the northeastern city of Arar. Three more people are being treated at a hospital in Arar.

The officers said that seven of the missing were in Riyadh and the other three in Arar.

On Tuesday, the civil defence in Riyadh received 1,700 calls for assistance.

“We have rescued 300 people and helped pull out 110 cars and buses that had been carried by the floods,” the civil defence, said, quoted by local news site Sabq.

More than 6,140 calls for help were placed in the other parts of the vast kingdom and civil defence teams were able to rescue 1,357 Saudi nationals and expatriates, it said.

“In Hael, in the north, where 631 incidents were reported, the civil defence was able to rescue 11 people in a van surrounded by floods,” it said.

Pictures circulated on social media and in the local media showed damaged roads and bridges, furious streams of water and immobilised cars.

They also depicted the suffering of people trying to reach their places of work and children attempting to surf their way into their schools.

The 3,000 new hires will be added to an existing Indian workforce of 8,000 when the firm's 36-acre campus in Trivandrum opens in November this year.

The state-of-the-art campus will stand tall next to the current Infosys facility in Trivandrum's technopark.

""Serving our customers globally requires us to be on a quest to explore and expand in new places. Due to our rapid growth we have had the ability to expand within our existing locations like Bangalore and Trivandrum,"" Pillai told Firstpost.

""We are setting up a campus in Trivandrum on 36 acres of land with over $100 million in investment in phase one. We are also planning to expand in central and northern India symbolizing UST'S commitment to grow and expand in India,"" added Pillai.

UST has 135 Fortune 100 clients in the health care, insurance, retail, financial services, manufacturing, media, utility, and energy industries. It currently has 12,000 employees, but expects headcount to rapidly expand over the next three years. The company sees the new talent coming from countries such as India, Mexico, Spain, Greece and Saudi Arabia.

""Over the next three years we plan to train 100,000 engineers globally of which at least 30,000 will be in India,"" said Nikki Arora, Director, marketing and global talent acquisition at UST Global.

""We have partnerships with over 135 academic institutions in India, whom we guide, and assist to train and develop young talent,"" added Arora.

UST Global has already taken the fairly unusual step of choosing Leon in Mexico to set up a new IT center, which will eventually be filled with 10,000 employees.

""Mexico being the tenth largest economy has great potential. Spanish is one the most widely spoken languages; it ranks at No. 3 among the world's top 50 languages. Having a bilingual workforce will give us an edge and open up avenues of growth for us in the Spanish speaking world.

It offers consulting, tech build, application development, infrastructure, e-commerce, business intelligence, data management, social media solutions, and BPO services.

There is always this notion that IT service providers only write thousands of lines of code, but at UST they take inventing new things very seriously. The firm's Apple Tree Lab encourages employees to spend part of their day in an ""innovation gym,"" developing user cases for new technologies. UST spots new opportunities for services by constantly looking for gaps between what it offers and what customers are asking for. Think of this as fill-in growth. A lot of ideas for new services come from the grassroots - its employees.

""We encourage our 12,000 employees to come up with new technologies and ways of doing things. Many of these ideas are spawned from what is driving our client's business; others are solutions that help our employees, and our community,"" said Arora.

Thousands of people have been rescued but the inability of rescue teams to navigate disaster-struck areas has left over 60,000 people stranded in Uttarakhand.

According to the State Disaster Mitigation Centre, while 22,392 pilgrims have been safely moved to camps, the death toll has reached 71, with 53 persons injured and 23 missing.

Though officials say 20 people have died in Kedarnath, according to survivors the death toll is much higher.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has agreed to give Rs. 1,000 crore to the State for disaster mitigation and announced Rs.2 lakh for the families of the dead and Rs. 50,000 for the injured.Kalyan Singh from Rajasthan’s Karauli district, who lost his wife at Kedarnath, recounted that on Monday the height of the swollen river could be that of a double-storey building. He was rescued on Tuesday evening.

Another survivor said people stranded on hilltops in Kedarnath had not received any food or water since Monday morning.

It will take one year to clear the slush: CM

“Kedarnath shrine is safe but it is under a lot of slush,” said Chief Minister Vijay Bahuguna, adding it would require at least one year to clear the slush. “The shrine will remain out of bounds for pilgrims for one year,” the Chief Minister said. Located in the Himalayas at a height of 3584 metres near the Chorabari glacier, the temple is a popular destination for Hindu pilgrims from all over the world.

Sources told The Hindu that people have been starving for four days now at Gaurikund and Munkatia, which is about 3 km from Gaurikund. Helicopters are airdropping the food aimlessly and people suffering from diabetes and heart problems do not have access to healthcare services. The weather has improved as rains have stopped at many places.

Raj Kishore Trivedi, a shopkeeper from Kedarnath, was admitted to the Doon Hospital in Dehradun with a broken leg on Tuesday evening. His shop was washed away early Monday morning in an avalanche of debris and water from a glacier that collapsed heaping destruction on the Kedarnath temple and the surrounding valley.

Indresh Mekhuri from Chamoli district, who visited Govindghat on Wednesday, told The Hindu: “Flash floods have destroyed more than half the market area at Govindghat. For two days the stranded pilgrims there were without food. Only today they ate after digging and drying some ration from the debris-laden gurdwara.”

According to him, hundreds of pilgrims are stranded at Govindghat and around 200 pilgrims on the other side of the river have not been rescued as a bridge has collapsed.

‘This was inevitable’

Uttarkashi residents complained that the destruction was inevitable as in almost 11 months since the last flash floods in August 2012, the government had not completed the pending construction work.

Reacting to this, Uttarakhand Disaster Management and Mitigation Centre Section Officer Pradeep Shukla said: “The construction started only a few months ago after the process of issuing tenders was over. The government can be called slow in this regard as it always receives enough money to mitigate disaster.”

He told The Hindu that more than 80 per cent of the funds allotted under the National Disaster Response Fund , the National Calamity Relief Fund and the State Disaster Response Fund were utilised by the Uttarakhand government almost every year. In 2012, the Centre gave an extra Rs.72 crore to the State government to restore the disaster-hit areas. However, this fund was not used for construction in areas where it was needed the most, he said.

Chief Ministers of many States showed concern over the present situation. The Rajasthan government has donated Rs. 2 crore to Uttarakhand for mitigating the disaster.

535,2684,hyderabad,2013,https://phys.org/news/2013-01-rice-grown-paddies-drought-stricken-expert.html,29 Jan 2013,"Rice grown without paddies can feed drought-stricken communities, expert says","(Phys.org)—Consumed by 3 billion people, rice is arguably the world's most important food staple, and one reason for its popularity is that rice can be grown under flooded conditions that suppress weeds, making cultivation easier.

In some parts of the world, water is in short supply, but farmers often devote what they can to rice farming because the crop is so important. However, research has led to a simple but profound solution that requires less water – growing rice in fields, a practice called aerobic rice production.

The practice relies on rainfall plus limited irrigation to meet the plants' moisture needs. It requires about 40 percent less water than paddy-grown rice, according to a University of Florida study in the current issue of Agronomy Journal.

Aerobic rice production is gaining popularity in India and Southeast Asia, particularly in drought-stricken or upland areas, said Rao Mylavarapu, a professor with UF's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences and one of the study's authors.

Mylavarapu is working to address a major challenge in aerobic rice production: yield. In the two-year study, conducted in Hyderabad, India, researchers grew rice in irrigated fields and paddies. The first year's aerobic rice harvest weighed 39 percent less than the paddy harvest; the second year the difference narrowed to 15 percent.

""Right now, there's no way you can get the same yield under optimal conditions,"" he said.

He explained that grain production is influenced by a rice plant's ability to use nitrogen, which in turn is influenced by moisture availability. In other words, paddied plants grown in standing water have an advantage over aerobic plants receiving modest irrigation. And, the rice varieties used for paddied production are different from the ones in aerobic production.

But in a drought there may not be enough water to keep rice paddies flooded. Under those circumstances, aerobic production can ensure that a community has rice to eat, while the paddied plants wither away.

""The real impact of aerobic rice will be shown in a rainfall shortage year,"" Mylavarapu said. ""However, in a rainfall shortage year, we have to be able to provide supplemental irrigation to aerobic rice and keep the root zone moist. So if there's a very bad drought, even aerobic rice will fail.""

He adds that few rice varieties have been developed specifically for aerobic production. In time, breeders may develop improved varieties and close the ""yield gap"" with paddied rice.

Currently, Mylavarapu's focus is on another aspect of the cropping system – overall grain production in systems where rice is rotated with corn. This approach is used on about 8.65 million acres in Asia because little soil preparation is needed to plant corn in a field following aerobic rice. In contrast, rice paddies must be drained and converted from a flooded anaerobic system to an aerobic system before the land can be used for corn.

In the study, researchers found that corn yields were about 5 percent higher when the corn followed aerobic rice, compared with paddied rice.

So far, aerobic rice production hasn't caught on with U.S. farmers, but that could be just a matter of time, he said.

""In the U.S., water quality is usually a bigger issue than water quantity,"" Mylavarapu said. ""Certainly, it (aerobic rice) will become a very important factor for the U.S. to consider in the future, with climate change.""

The United States is the world's 10th largest producer of paddied rice, with annual production of about 12 million tons, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. Arkansas is the leading U.S. rice",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,non-severe

It may take over a couple of more months for the picturesque Bhavani Island to get back to its original sheen.

An official team comprising the Chief Engineer, Projects, Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC), in-charge Vijayawada Divisional Manager G. Ramakrishna and others is scheduled to visit the island next week to assess and review the existing conditions at the island which is in a shambles.

Floods that ravaged the scenic beauty of the island are not the only culprit for ruining the splendour of the place. A prolonged delay on the part of the Tourism Corporation authorities to take up renovation works in the wake of the controversy surrounding the proposed leasing out of the island to a private company added to the neglect of the once-enduring place.

The 130-acre area of the island is reduced to 128 acres due to soil erosion in the aftermath of the floods. The lush green lawns that beckoned picnickers are now patches of dry land in light brown shade. The spider webs, the Burma Bridge and the country swings are in tatters. The water-soaked wooden bulging staircase leading to the restaurant may give in any moment.

The four tree-top cottages that were built later than the remaining four clusters of 24 cottages, and had always been in great demand, stand as a picture of disregard. “The wooden railings of the tree-top cottages are completely damaged and their dilapidated condition has forced us to temporarily close them down for the public,” says Mr. Ramakrishna.

“We intend to take up renovation works at an estimated cost of Rs.2 crore in the first phase. Though there are a series of plans to introduce new features on the island, we will have to first focus on the renovation works. Once the existing facilities are strengthened, we will shift focus on bringing in new add-on facilities,” he says.

The Rs.100-crore Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) property, perched on the serene Krishna River, was launched amid much fanfare by former Chief Minister the late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. The sprawling 130-acre area dotted with exciting features like cottages, restaurants, a conference hall and a number of thrilling adventure games besides country swings became picnickers’ paradise.

According to farmers’ representatives, only an impressive investment could help realize the actual potential of agrarian economy. Such spending must be backed by transparency in utilisation.

“We [Sindh] contribute around 23 per cent of Pakistan’s agriculture GDP or $11 billion to $12 billion. We can increase this volume to $16 billion to $17 billion with proper investment and a carefully worked out strategy,” argues Mehmood Nawaz Shah, general secretary of Sindh Abadgar Board, of a vibrant growers’ body of Sindh.

According to his assessment, allocations have been meagre if Annual Development Programme (ADP) 2012-13 of Sindh’s agriculture sector is to be discussed.

Information available on Sindh government’s website regarding agriculture sector’s ADP 2012-13 shows that Rs2998.000 million was earmarked on the development side for five major sectors with mechanisation getting Rs1648.490 million, extension Rs500.552 million, research Rs398.794 million, water management Rs319.927million and marketing Rs130.237million.

Mechanisation got the major chunk as part of the amount was supposed to have been spent on provision of tractors with subsidised rates whose number was increased to 8000 for current fiscal year from 6000.

Provision of tractors is appreciated by farmers keeping in view the fact that many farmers don’t even have access to it.

The government should ensure that they and growers share equal cost of laser land leveler which is currently not the case. According to Nabi Bux Sathio of Sindh Chamber of Agriculture, a grower is supposed to pay Rs367,000 against government’s share of Rs220,000.

“The land leveling of an acre costs around Rs12-Rs15,000 and with soaring price-hike in cost of inputs, growers find it hard to opt for laser land levelling,” he contends.

He asks the government to review cost of inputs and reduce them substantially.

For instance, if prices of DAP and urea fertilisers are reduced by 50 per cent, it can be of great help for them and then farmers would be giving serious thought to land leveling which would improve their per acre productivity.

He makes another point. Laser land levelling will be meaningless unless quality seeds with different varieties and adequate irrigation water are available, as these are sine qua non for substantive agricultural growth.

Alternate variety of different seeds is necessary because if one breed of seed loses its potential then its alternate must be available in market.

This can only be done through investment in research sector and qualified officers’ postings.

A recent dispute two years back, over sugarcane varieties, is a case in point when cane growers were barred from cultivating a few varieties under a notification by the government. This left farmers high and dry who had already grown it.

Sugar mill owners had refused to buy those varieties, questioning recovery of sucrose content. With the federal government’s intervention it was resolved at last.

Sathio is of the view that with serious attention on extension services, crop enhancement seems achievable. Currently it is not upto the desired level. He says that an average per acre sugarcane yield is less than 500 maunds, wheat’s 23 maunds, paddy’s 42 maunds and cotton 23 maunds.

This can be increased if the government rationalises the allocations and put a proper policy framework in place.

“We can achieve the 15 million bales production target that we often set, provided per acre productivity is increased,” he says. At the same time he opposes the trend of holding seminars and providing information about cropping season through FM radio channels, stating that this involves a huge spending by agriculture officials.

On the contrary if agriculture extension officials obtain land from farmers at union council level for demonstration of modern farm practices and cultivation of different crops, this can prove more fruitful for dissemination of information.

He adds that a farmer who offers land for such trial can be asked to bear with the expenses of water availability and fertiliser, while the rest should come from the government.

He said that such UC level demonstrations will be productive if an army of field staff with agriculture officials put in serious efforts. Only efficiency is required.

Farmers have been emphasising the need that extension and research sectors should be overhauled given experiences of farmers during the 2010 floods and 2011 heavy monsoon rains.

After having suffered huge economic losses, the farmers no one to turn to for technical assistance.

They didn’t even get primary information on how to handle soil quality of their land which was badly damaged during these back to back disasters. The scene was no different even during the 2012 rains.

Mahmood Nawaz Shah supports modern farming practices and says that tractors’ provision is a right step but transparency should be given top priority in the distribution process.

He believes that if lands are levelled through laser land leveler then it will ensure water conservation and equal availability of water in an acre.

The government, he says, should explore options of providing harvesters to control pre and post harvesting losses as much as possible.

“There is a big gap in what we contribute to Pakistan agriculture GDP and allocations made to our province’s agriculture sector.

""If we are giving $11 billion to $12 billion, the sector is getting Rs3 billion or $300 million. It is a meager allocation on the face of it”, he remarks. Further stating that such allocations should commensurate with the sector’s production potential.

In the wake of a series of disasters, there has been crop failures, fallout of international price mechanism, suppression of prices of wheat, cotton, paddy and onion.

But the government seemed to be lacking a strategy on how to handle such a situation. There was a lack of support for farmers too because there was no back-up plan to offer a helping hand to growers, battered by rains and floods, he adds.

He proposes that ADP 2013-14 must have provision for all these issues.

“We are now having abnormal weather patterns due to climatic changes so we have to adapt to these conditions,” he says.

Farmers bodies have been calling for a watercourse lining programme that had paid dividends wherever they were lined. Though there have been complaints of financial irregularities in schemes’ execution.

Growers say that farmers who are involved in any wrongdoing must be brought to justice, but the programme shouldn’t be compromised.

They oppose selective execution schemes like buildings of ponds which are meant for those areas usually hit by acute water shortage for small crops cultivation by farmers.

Not only influential farmers but some bureaucrats built them on their lands in violation of the execution plan.

Shah says that it has been a long standing demand of growers that Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD) should be built and Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) should be fully rehabilitated because these have been the cause of major destruction to farmlands during heavy rains and floods.

Secondly, following the 18th amendment, agriculture is a devolved subject therefore provincial agriculture and irrigation departments’ capacity should be enhanced to respond to the needs of the farming community and effectively handle projects that are handed over to them.",discussion,2012 Sindh floods,"Sindh, Pakistan",July 2012,August 2012,Sindh,100 mm,10 billion PKR,200,1 million people displaced,The floods caused widespread damage to infrastructure and agriculture.

“Karikal Cholan Manimandpam”, a memorial announced by Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, in honour of the great king who built Grand Anicut, has been completed at Grand Anicut in Thanjavur district.

“Ninety per cent of the work has been completed. Some stucco works are going on in the central dome of the building and flooring with marble has to be done. Other works have been completed,” said the Public Works Department engineers.

The beautiful structure, in Dravidian architecture, is being built on 4,000 sq. ft. at the anicut. It has a central dome surrounded by four domes and another separate four domes on pillars in the four corners. The central dome is 33-ft. high and the four domes surrounding it are 20-ft. high each. Four corner domes are 26-ft high. Park and lawn works around the memorial is in progress and 85 per cent of the compound wall work has been completed, engineers said.

The memorial on the banks of the Ullar is coming up at a cost of Rs. 2.10 crore. “The Manimandapam will be ready for inauguration in January,” the engineers said.

Karikal Cholan built the Grand Anicut in the second century A.D. for controlling floods and for irrigation in Chola Naadu (Cauvery delta). The chola king built the structure in such a way that excess water was diverted into the Kollidam from the anicut. Additions were made by British engineers to the original structure. At present, the Cauvery, the Vennar, the Kollidam, and the Grand Anicut canals branch out from the anicut. Kollidam remains the major flood carrier. It carried nearly three lakh cusecs of water during floods in 2005.

The Cauvery system can take nearly 13,000 cusecs and the Vennar 13,000 cusecs maximum. But normally 10,000 to 12,000 cusecs are released into these rivers for irrigation. Grand Anicut canal can take 4,000 cusecs. But only 3,500 cusecs is released on normal days.

The Chief Minister announced the construction of the memorial when she inaugurated the memorial for John Pennycuick who built the Mullaperiyar dam.

The foundation stone for the memorial was laid in May through videoconferencing. The memorial is expected to be inaugurated during Pongal in January.",solution,2005 Tamil Nadu floods,"Tamil Nadu, India",November 2005,December 2005,Tamil Nadu,1000 mm,10 billion USD,300,1 million people displaced,The floods were caused by heavy rainfall in the Western Ghats.

According to latest news, It is stated that the concert will be performed on Monday.

""Jinxed."" That was overwhelming opinion of fans of Swedish electronic dance super-group Swedish House Mafia after their concert had to be cancelled for the second time in India in less than three months.

The concert, scheduled in Bangalore for Sunday was put off as the plane carrying the group from Jakarta to India was damaged following a storm and floods there, and the members were unable to leave, a note on the SHM Facebook page said.

The SHM concert in Mumbai on November 17 was postponed on account of Shiv Sena supremo Bal Thackeray's death.

Organisers of the event, Sunburn Arena, said they were working to reschedule the Bangalore show, part of the band's farewell tour, for Monday, January 21. This has not yet been confirmed.

Ticket-holders were promised a refund if the concert was cancelled.

But this came as small consolation to fans, who took to social media sites to express their disappointment even as rumours about the postponement were put to rest with the group's announcement.

""We've been looking forward to the show since September, when it was initially announced,"" said Ashmita Mangharam, a class 12 student in Bangalore. She says she lost about Rs. 9,000 making the trip for the cancelled concert in Mumbai last year, with 15 other friends.

Dhiren Raghu, an engineering student at R.V. College too says he spent Rs. 15,000 on his savings to make the trip to Mumbai last year, and was excited that the group whom he had followed for years was finally coming to Bangalore. ""I hope the concert happens on Monday,"" he said.

Questions to the organisers on the number of tickets sold and the security measures in place to control crowds, were not answered at the time of writing. At least 25,000 people were expected to attend the concert in Mumbai and a similar number in Bangalore.

The rescheduled show in Mumbai will go on as announced on Tuesday, organisers added.",,Not flood article,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Non-severe

Japanese consumer electronics giant Sony on Wednesday said its Indian operations have emerged as its fourth largest globally, overtaking businesses in Brazil and Russia by the end of December quarter this fiscal.

The sluggish demand in developed nations has helped the company’s growing subsidiary Sony India, which has clocked a revenue of over Rs 6,000 crore during April-December period in 2012-13, to improve its position in global ranking.

“The Indian operations has become the number four in global ranking. We have overtaken Brazil and Russia, which were ahead of us in last fiscal,” Sony India Managing Director Kenichiro Hibi told reporters in Las Vegas.

The existing top three positions are held by the US, China and Japan, he said without sharing details.

“We have almost touched last year’s revenue... We are completely on our track to treble our turnover to Rs 20,000 crore by 2015,” Mr. Hibi said.

The Indian operations’ revenue for 2011-12 was Rs 6,313 crore compared to Rs 5,446 crore in the previous fiscal. The company is expecting 30-40 per cent growth in this fiscal.

Sony India’s achievement comes at a time when its parent is reporting losses due to unfavourable foreign exchange rates, impact of tsunami in Japan, floods in Thailand and adverse market sentiments in developed countries.

Sony Corporation reported 9.58 per cent fall in its sales for the year ending March 31, 2012, at 6.49 trillion yen. Its net loss also widened to 456.7 billion yen in the year.

For the quarter ending September 30 last year, the Japanese major incurred a net loss of 15.5 billion yen. Its sales stood at 1,604.7 billion yen.

Asked about the growth driver for Sony India, Mr. Hibi said: “Bravia, Vaio and Xperia are the major contributor to our rise. These three have contributed 70 per cent of our revenue.”

He further said the Indian operations is contributing 5-10 per cent of Sony Corp’s global revenue at present and it “has the potential to grow"".

When asked if Sony India will be able to move further in the ranking, Mr. Hibi said: “The gap between Japan and India is very big, but the growth rate in India is higher than that of the parent... The headquarter is focussing more in India and it is a very strategic market.”

To expand its presence further, the company is looking to customise products more to meet Indian customers’ demand, he added.

The company will also introduce more “affordable and entry-level products, mostly TV sets, but with certain premiumness” in India during next year.

Mr. Hibi, however, said the company does not have any plan to set up an assembly line in India at present despite “demand for our products are rising”.",discussion,2011 Thailand floods,Thailand,July 2011,January 2012,"['Bangkok', 'Phuket', 'Chiang Mai', 'Nakhon Ratchasima']","['200 mm, 300 mm, 400 mm']","['10 billion USD, 15 billion USD, 20 billion USD']","['200, 300, 400']","['Destroyed homes and infrastructure', 'Disrupted transportation and communication', 'Loss of crops and livestock']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Severe
